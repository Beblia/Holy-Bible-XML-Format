Da Bible wen say dis befo time: “Gotta trus God. Den you goin get um right wit him, An you can live fo real kine.” Everybody Make How Dey Not Suppose To</verse>
				<verse number="18">One mo ting God wen let us undastan: Da peopo ack jalike God no matta, an dey do da kine tings dey not suppose to do. But God no take wat dey do. Az why he goin judge um from up dea in da sky. Inside dem, dey know wass true, but dey stay do da kine tings dey not suppose to do. Az how dey no let da odda peopo know wass true.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Dey no mo excuse, cuz everyting dat peopo can know bout God, ony easy fo dem fo undastan, az why. God, he wen show dem awready.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Dis wat I mean: From befo time wen God wen make da world, anybody dat try fo undastan da stuffs God wen make, dey can figga how God stay, no matta no can see God. You know, God get dis unreal power dat goin stay lidat foevas. By how he make, he stay God fo shua. An dey can undastan all dat, dose guys. Az why dey no mo excuse fo how dey make.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Dey know bout God, but dey no like tell him, “Eh, you stay awesome, cuz you stay God!” Dey no like tell um “Mahalo plenny!” Dass why wat dey stay tinking, all poho awready. Cuz dey no undastan notting, jalike everyting come all dark inside dea heart.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Dey tell, “Me, I one akamai guy dat everytime know wat fo do!” Dey ony tink dat, but you know, dey still yet stupid.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Dey no like stick wit da God who everytime awesome an no goin come poho bumbye. But dese guys, dey tink lidis: “We no like dat kine God! Mo betta we stick wit one idol kine god dat look jalike one guy, no matta bumbye he goin come poho. O mo betta our god goin look jalike one bird o one lizard o one nodda animal.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Cuz da way dey acking, dass why God wen let um go do wat dey like. He let um do all da kine pilau kine stuff, cuz dass how dey like do inside dea hearts. Dass why dey no mo shame notting, how dey make any kine wit dea own bodies wit odda peopo.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Dem guys, dey hear da true stuffs from God, but dey no like listen. Dey tink lidis: “Mo betta we go do da odda stuff, no matta bulai!” Dey show respeck to all da stuffs God wen make, an dey do all da kine religious stuff fo um, but da One who make everyting, dey no like give love an respeck to him. I stay talking bout God. Eh, he all right! Can talk good bout him every time! Az right!</verse>
				<verse number="26">An dass why God wen let dem guys do all dat, an dey ony go do how dey like do. An so dey all come all itchy, an no mo shame notting. Eh, you know, even da wahines, dey no like make like dey wahines, dey like change how dey stay.</verse>
				<verse number="27">An same ting wit da guys. Dey no like make like dey suppose to wit da wahines. One guy stay all itchy fo one nodda guy. Dey no mo shame notting fo how dey make wit each odda. So fo dat, dey goin get it! Cuz dey stay far from da right way, an dey going get watevas fo how dey wen make.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Dey tink, “Mo betta no go tink bout stick tight wit God fo real kine!” Az why God wen let um go do how dey like do. Az why dey ony can tink pilau kine stuff. So, no good how dey make.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Dey not right kine peopo. Dey ony do pilau kine stuff. Dey greedy guys. Dey get pilau attitude. Dey all jealous. Dey like kill peopo. Dey like go beef everybody. Dey sneaky buggas. Dey ony tink bad kine stuff. Dey tell stuffs dey not suppose to bout da odda guys.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Dey talk stink. Dey everytime stay huhu wit God. Dey tink dey so high makamaka, so dat peopo no can come by dem. Dey tink dey it. Dey talk big. Dey try figga how dey can make everyting hamajang. Dey no do wat dea mudda-fadda guys tell um fo do.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Dey no like undastan notting. Dey make promise, but dey no keep um. Dey no mo love an aloha, an dey no give chance notting.</verse>
				<verse number="32">God wen tell um how dey suppose to make, an dey wen hear all dat awready. Dey know dis too: if get anybody dat no make like wat God say, fo shua he goin mahke. But dese guys, dey go do all dat kine stuff, an dey tink good wen da odda guys go do lidat too.</verse>

				<verse number="15">How dey ack, dass jalike dey get Godʼs Rules right dea inside dea heart. Dea heart tell dem bout wat dey doing. Wen dey go tink wat stay right an wat stay wrong, den dey figga.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Dass how goin be bumbye wen God goin make Jesus Christ da Judge fo da secret stuff inside everybodyʼs heart. Dass wat da Good Kine Stuff From God say, jalike I stay teaching. Da Jewish Peopo An Godʼs Rules</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now you dea, you like peopo fo know you one Jewish guy. You trus Godʼs Rules. You talk big bout God.</verse>
				<verse number="18">You know wat God like you fo do. You know wass da bestes kine stuff, cuz da teachas wen teach you from Godʼs Rules.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You stay shua you can tell da peopo dat no can see wea fo go. You tink you jalike one light fo all da peopo dat stay inside da dark.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You can teach da peopo who donno notting an da ones dat still yet need one teacha. Cuz you get Godʼs Rules, you tink you get all da trut an you know everyting.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So, you go teach da odda peopo. You teach yoaself too, o wat? You go preach dey betta not rip off nobody. You rip off too, o wat?</verse>
				<verse number="22">You say, “No go fool aroun behind yoa husban o wifeʼs back.” You go fool aroun too, o wat? You tink da idol kine gods no good. You take stuff from dea temples, o wat?</verse>
				<verse number="23">You talk big bout Godʼs Rules. You making God shame cuz you broke um, o wat?</verse>
				<verse number="24">Jalike da Bible wen say befo time, “Da peopos dat not Jews try run down Godʼs name cuz a you guys.”</verse>

				<verse number="26">So den, if get one guy dat not one Jew, an he do all da good kine stuff Godʼs Rules say, den no matta he neva cut skin, he Godʼs guy. Dass jalike he get da mark too.</verse>
				<verse number="27">So den, da peopo dat not Jews, if dey do wat Godʼs Rules say, dey goin show dat you Jewish peopo wen broke Godʼs Rules. No matta dey no mo da cut skin mark, an you guys get da Rules inside da Bible from befo time, an da cut skin mark too.</verse>
				<verse number="28">No matta somebody who come from Abraham get da cut skin mark on top his body, dat no make him one Jewish guy fo real kine.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Da Jewish guy who fo real stay same ting lidat inside. Godʼs Spirit stay in charge da guy, an dass jalike one spesho mark inside his heart. Da Rules inside one book, dass not wat make him Godʼs kid. Az not da peopo dat goin talk good bout him, goin be God dat goin do um.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">So den, how come mo betta fo be one Jewish guy? You tink da Jewish guy who get da cut skin mark get mo spesho tings den da guy dat not Jew?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Az right! Help um plenny fo do everyting. First, cuz God wen give da Jewish peopo all da stuffs he wen tell um, an he wen tell um fo take care all dat.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So den, wat? You tink dat God no can do wat he wen say he goin do, jus cuz get some Jewish peopo dat neva like trus him?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Not! God everytime da real ting, no matta everybody dat stay all ova da world all bulaias! Jalike da Bible say bout God, “Da peopo goin find out Dat wat he say, az right. No matta dey say dat he do wrong, He goin win still yet, Cuz he no do da bad kine stuff notting.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But if we do da wrong tings, an dat goin show everybody even mo dat God stay doing da right tings, den wat we goin say bout dat? We goin say God do wrong wen he punish us, o wat? (Dass how some peopo stay talking, you know.)</verse>
				<verse number="6">No way! God no do da wrong kine stuff notting wen he punish us. Dass why he get da right fo punish da peopo inside da world wen dey do da wrong kine stuff.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If I go bulai, an dat show everybody even mo dat God tell da trut, an he stay awesome, den how come God say was bad, da ting I wen do?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Even get some peopo dat stay talking stink bout us an tell odda peopo dat we say, “Eh, we go do da bad kine stuff, so den everyting goin come good!” God goin do da right ting wen he punish da peopo dat tink lidat! No Mo Nobody Dat Do Da Right Ting Everytime (Songs fo God 5:9; 14:1-3; 36:1; 53:1-3; 140:3; 143:2; Proverbs 1:6; Ecclesiastes 7:20; Isaiah 59:7-8)</verse>
				<verse number="9">So den, wat? You tink us Jewish peopo stay mo betta den dem? No way! Cuz I wen awready show you guys dat da bad kine stuff get power ova everybody, da Jewish peopo an da peopo dat not Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jalike da Bible wen say, “No mo nobody dat do da right ting everytime. No mo even one guy!</verse>
				<verse number="11">No mo nobody dat undastan, No mo nobody dat try fo know God!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Nobody eva do how dey suppose to. All togedda dey wen come poho. No mo nobody dat do good tings, No mo even one guy!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Dea mout stay jalike one open grave. Dey bulai wit dea mout. Da poison come from inside dea mout, Jalike one snake.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Wit dea mout Dey everytime like say stink stuffs fo hurt somebody, Cuz az how dey stay inside.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Dey move fast fo kill somebody.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Every place dey go, Dey like bus up everyting, An make big trouble fo peopo.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Dey neva know how fo make good wit odda peopo, An make dea hearts rest inside.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Dey no mo respeck fo God notting.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now, we know dat everyting Godʼs Rules say, dass fo da peopo dat get da Rules ova dem. Dass why nobody can make argue wit God. Bumbye everybody all ova da world gotta go in front God da Judge, so he can say if dey wen do da bad kine stuff, o wat.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Dass why no mo nobody dat can say dat dey get um right wit God, jus cuz dey wen do everyting Godʼs Rules say. Not even! Godʼs Rules ony show dat us wen do da bad kine stuff. God Make Us Get Um Right Wit Him Wen We Trus Um</verse>
				<verse number="21">Stay clear now how God wen go make plan so we can get um right wit him. We can get um right wit him, but not cuz a Godʼs Rules. Godʼs Rules an da guys dat wen talk fo God long time ago, dey tell all dat inside da Bible.</verse>
				<verse number="22">God wen make us get um right wit him wen we trus Jesus Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. He do dat fo everybody dat trus him, no mo notting diffren.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Cuz everybody do bad kine stuff. Dass why nobody can come awesome by demself, da way God like make um come awesome.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But can get um right wit God, cuz God get good heart an like do plenny good stuff fo peopo. God cut um loose from da power da bad kine stuff get ova dem, cuz dey tight wit Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="25">God wen make Jesus da main guy, so he can be da sacrifice fo hemo da shame fo all da bad kine stuff everybody do, ony if dey go trus him an dey shua dat he wen go bleed an mahke fo dem. Dass how God show dat he make everyting come right: he let um go fo da bad kine stuff dey wen do befo time an hemo dea shame.</verse>
				<verse number="26">You know, befo time God neva push hard fo peopo fo pau do da bad kine stuff. Nowdays, fo show everybody dat he everytime do da right ting, he make everybody dat trus Jesus get um right wit him.</verse>
				<verse number="27">So, wat? How come you tink you can talk big now? No can! Wot?! You tell how you get one Rule dat say, you get um right wit God cuz you wen do good kine stuffs? Eh, not even! We can ony tell bout dat Rule dat say we get um right wit God cuz we trus um.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So dis wat we figga: Anybody can get um right wit God wen dey trus him, not wen dey ony do da stuff Godʼs Rules say.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Kay den. God, he ony fo da Jewish peopo? You tink he not God fo da peopo dat not Jews? Fo shua, he God fo dem too!</verse>
				<verse number="30">Cuz ony get one God. Da guys dat get da cut skin mark fo show dey Jewish kine, God make um so dey get um right wit him cuz dey trus him. An da peopo dat not Jews an no mo da mark on top dem, he make dem so dey get um right wit him cuz dey trus him too.</verse>
				<verse number="31">You tink dat wen we trus God, dat mean we make Godʼs Rules poho? No way! We make da Rules mo solid.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">So den, Abraham, da ancesta guy dat us Jewish peopo all come from, wat we get fo say bout wat wen happen to him?</verse>
				<verse number="2">We can say dis: If Abraham wen get um right wit God cuz a da stuffs he wen do, den he can go talk big bout dat. But in front God he no can talk big notting.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Dis wat da Bible say: “Abraham wen trus God, Dass why God wen say dat Abraham get um right wit him.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Cuz wen get one guy dat work, his boss pay him fo dat. Da pay not one present -- dass wat da boss owe um.</verse>
				<verse number="5">God da One dat get da right fo say dat whoeva trus him, dey da one dat get um right wit him, no matta dey neva care bout God befo time. No can work fo get um right wit God, ony gotta trus God, an den God goin say dat you stay right.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Same ting. David wen talk bout how peopo goin stay good inside wen God say dat dey get um right wit him, an dey neva work notting fo dat. He say:</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Da peopo dat wen broke Godʼs Rules, God wen let um go, An wen hemo dea shame. Az why dey stay good inside! Da peopo dat wen do da bad kine stuffs, God wen hemo dem from all da bad kine stuffs dey wen do.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Da guy can stay good inside Wen da Boss no make one list A da bad kine stuff da guy wen do.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">You tink ony da Jewish guys dat get da cut skin mark, dey da ony ones can stay good inside lidat, an da odda guys, dey no can? You know, awready we wen tell dat Abraham wen trus God, an cuz a dat, God wen tell dat Abraham get um right wit him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Kay den, wat time was, wen God wen say dat? Was wen Abraham get da cut skin mark, o befo wen he neva get da mark? Eh, he neva say dat afta he wen get um, but wen he neva have um yet.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Bumbye Abraham wen get da cut skin mark. Dat wen show proof dat he wen go trus God. Was befo Abraham get da mark dat God wen say Abraham get um right wit him. Dass how Abraham wen come jalike da fadda fo everybody dat trus God, an God wen say dey get um right wit him, no matta dey no mo da mark.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Same time Abraham stay jalike da fadda fo da Jewish guys dat get da mark too. But not jus cuz dey get da mark, but cuz dey stay trus Christ jalike Abraham wen trus um, befo he wen get da cut skin mark. We Trus God, An We Get Wat He Promise</verse>
				<verse number="13">God wen promise Abraham an da peopo dat goin come from him afta, dat bumbye dey goin own da whole world. God wen say dat cuz Abraham wen trus God, an get um right wit him. But God neva say dat Abraham goin get um jus cuz he do wat da Rules say.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You know, da peopo dat ony like stick wit Godʼs Rules, if dey wen get wat God wen promise jus cuz a dat, den az no mean notting fo trus God, an poho da promise God wen make.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Weaevas get Godʼs Rules, goin get peopo who goin broke um, an God no goin take it. Weaeva Godʼs Rules no stay, no mo nobody goin broke um.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Dass why you betta trus him. God like do plenny good tings fo da peopo who trus him. Dass how we know dat Godʼs promise stay fo shua fo all us guys who come from Abraham. Not da peopo dat get Godʼs Rules ony, but da peopo dat same time trus God, jalike Abraham. cuz he jalike da fadda fo all us guys.</verse>
				<verse number="17">God wen say inside da Bible, “I wen make you da fadda fo plenny diffren kine peopos.” Fo shua God goin make dat promise solid, an God, he da One dat Abraham wen trus. God make da peopo come back alive afta dey mahke. He ony gotta say someting fo make someting dass fo real come from notting.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Abraham wen trus God an wen wait fo him, even wen he neva see notting coming from God. Dass how he wen come “da fadda fo plenny diffren kine peopos,” jalike da Bible wen say, “Goin get plenny peopo come from you.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Abrahamʼs trus was strong fo God, no matta he figga, his body litto mo ready fo mahke, cuz he near hundred year old, an Sarah, she no can come hapai awready.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Abraham neva tink dat God no can do um, an den pau trus God. His trus fo God wen stay solid, cuz he know how awesome God stay.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Abraham wen know fo shua dat wateva God wen promise, he strong nuff fo give um.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So dass why God wen figga dat Abraham get um right wit him.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Wen da Bible say how God figga dat, he no say dat ony fo Abraham,</verse>
				<verse number="24">he say um fo us guys too. God goin figga we get um right wit him too, if we trus him. Cuz God da One dat wen make Jesus our Boss come back alive afta he wen mahke.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus wen mahke cuz we neva make how we suppose to. An den, he wen come alive again fo make us guys get um right wit God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">So den, cuz we wen trus God, az why we get um right wit him. Dass why our heart stay clear inside wit God awready, cuz our Boss Jesus, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, he wen make um good fo everybody.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Christ wen make um so we can come tight wit God an get all da good stuff he like do fo us, cuz we wen trus him first. An dass how we come solid inside. We feel good inside cuz we stay shua dat bumbye God goin make us come awesome jalike him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">No matta we get any kine hard time, we goin feel good inside, cuz we know, dat hard time goin make um so we can hang in dea mo betta.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Wen we hang in dea, dat make us mo solid. Wen we mo solid, den we stay shua dat bumbye God goin do plenny fo us.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Wen we stay shua dat God goin do um fo us, we no need worry notting. Cuz God give us his Good an Spesho Spirit, fo make us feel inside our heart how much plenny he get love an aloha fo us.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Wen we neva have power notting, Christ wen mahke fo all us guys dat wen ack jalike God no matta. Dass da time God wen pick.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Eh you know, nobody goin mahke fo one guy dat ony do right kine stuff! If get one guy dat everytime get good heart, maybe bumbye somebody go mahke fo help dat kine guy.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But den God wen show how plenny love an aloha he get fo us, cuz same time we was doing bad kine stuff, Christ still yet wen go mahke fo us.</verse>
				<verse number="9">God wen say we get um right wit him, cuz Christ wen bleed an mahke fo us. God no take da bad kine stuff peopo stay doing, but cuz a Christ, us guys no goin suffa.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Befo time, we wen stay agains God. But den Godʼs Own Boy wen mahke so we can go da same side wit God. So now we da same side wit God, even mo, Christ goin take us outa da bad kine stuff we doing, cuz he wen come back alive again.</verse>
				<verse number="11">An dass not all! We like tell dat God stay awesome, cuz we stay tight wit him. An we stay tight wit him, cuz our Boss Jesus Christ wen mahke fo us, so now we can go da same side wit God. Adam an Christ, Dey Da Same But Dey Diffren</verse>
				<verse number="12">So den, from da start befo time, da first man Adam, he da one wen start fo do da bad kine stuff. Az why God neva let um live foeva. An from dat time, all da peopo inside da world make jalike dat man. Cuz dey make lidat, same ting jalike dat man, dey all gotta mahke.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Befo time, wen still yet neva have da Rules from God, all ova da world had peopo dat was doing bad kine stuff. But wen neva have da Rules, nobody wen go write down wat da bad kine stuff peopo do.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Everybody from Adam till Moses time gotta mahke fo shua, no matta dey neva do da same ting dat God wen tell Adam fo no do. Still yet, dey wen do odda kine bad stuff. Az why dey gotta mahke jalike Adam. You know, Adam an Jesus, dem two da same, but den dey diffren. Az Adam da one, he jalike one picha fo show Jesus, da One dat goin show up bumbye.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Da bad kine stuff dat Adam wen do, dass notting like da good kine stuff Jesus wen do fo us. Had da one guy Adam, dat wen go do wat God tell um not fo do, an cuz a dat, everybody wen mahke. But den da odda guy, Jesus Christ, eh, he do plenny good kine stuffs fo us, an he neva expeck notting back from nobody. Dass nuff fo everybody, cuz God everytime like do plenny fo us.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Eh, da ting dat God wen give us guys, dass mo betta fo everybody den da bad ting dat da one guy Adam wen do. Afta he wen do dat, God da Judge say, “Gotta punish um!” But even afta da peopo wen go blow it choken times, jalike God da Judge give um one spesho present -- he tell, “Now, can get um right wit me!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">So den, da one guy Adam, wen go do one ting dat he not suppose to do. Cuz a dat, now everybody gotta mahke. An now, da one guy Jesus Christ wen do one real good ting, an dass mo betta fo us guys. Now, us guys get um right wit God. Dass jalike one present he give us. An he goin make us come alive fo real kine, an be da Kingʼs helpas.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So, had dat one guy dat wen do wat he not suppose to do, an cuz a dat now everybody gotta get punish. But den same ting, had one nodda guy dat wen do da right ting, an cuz a dat, everybody can get um right wit God an come alive fo real kine.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Dis wat I mean: Adam, he one guy dat neva listen to God. Dat make plenny guys be peopo dat do da bad kine stuff dat God no like. An da odda guy Jesus, he wen listen to wat God wen tell him fo do. Dat goin make plenny guys be peopo dat get um right wit God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">God wen give us his Rules so everybody goin know how plenny bad da bad kine stuff stay. But wea eva get peopo dat do da bad kine stuff mo an moa, God do mo an mo plenny good kine stuff.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Befo time, da bad kine stuff dat peopo wen do, take ova dem an make um mahke. But now, cuz a wat our Boss Jesus Christ wen do, God do someting real good fo us, he take us ova, so us guys can get um right wit him an come alive fo real kine foeva.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">So den, wat? You tink we goin say, “Mo bad kine stuffs we do, dat goin make God do some mo plenny good kine stuffs fo us bumbye.” We goin say all dat?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Eh, no way! Us guys no mo notting fo do wit da bad kine stuff! Az jalike we mahke awready. Cuz you know, one mahke guy no can do notting bad. If we stay jalike we mahke, how we goin stay doing da bad kine stuff? Dass no good!</verse>
				<verse number="3">You guys donno dat wen all us guys wen get baptize fo show we Jesus Christ guys, dass jalike we wen mahke same time he wen mahke?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Wen we get baptize, dat mean jalike dey wen bury us same time dey wen bury Christ, cuz jalike we mahke too. Da Fadda, he get awesome power, an afta Christ wen mahke, da Fadda wen make um come back alive. So da Fadda like us use his power too fo live one new kine life.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Us guys jalike we wen mahke wen Jesus wen mahke. Dass why fo shua we goin come back alive from mahke jalike Jesus wen come back alive.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We know dat da no good kine guy we was befo, pau awready, jalike dat guy wen mahke on top da cross wit Christ. Now dat no good kine guy no mo power. Now we no need do da bad kine stuff. Now we not stuck -- we not slave guys.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Afta one guy mahke, no mo notting dat can make um do bad kine stuff no moa.</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Eh, all you bruddas an sistas dat undastan how da Rules stay. I like tell you guys dis: from all da time you stay alive, da Rules get power ova you. But afta you mahke, da Rules no mo power ova you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Da Rules say, if get one wahine dat stay married to one guy, she gotta stick wit da guy da whole time he stay alive. But if da husban mahke, den she no need do wat da Rules fo da husban an da wife say.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If she go live wit one nodda guy, an her husban alive still yet, dass mean she one wahine dat fool aroun behind her husbanʼs back. But den, if her husban stay mahke, den da Rules fo da husban an da wife no mo notting fo do wit her no moa. An if she go marry one nodda guy, dat mean she no go fool aroun behind her mahke husbanʼs back.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Same ting wit you guys, my bruddas an sistas! Christ wen go mahke, his body, everyting. Same ting jalike you guys wen mahke awready, so now da Rules no mo notting fo do wit you guys. Dass why now you guys can come his guys, an stay tight wit dis guy Christ dat wen come back alive afta he wen mahke. All dis jalike dat wahine can marry one nodda guy now, an no mo problem. So now, wat you do an how you ack, everyting fo God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Befo time, us guys wen ony like do da kine bad stuff our bodies wen like do. Cuz we wen know da Rules, we wen like go agains um, an dat ony wen make us guys da kine peopo dat do wat we not suppose to. From dat, wat we wen do an how we wen ack dat time, everyting was fo cut us guys off from God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Befo time we gotta do wat da Rules say. Now we no need, cuz jalike we wen mahke awready. Da old way, da Rules inside da Bible neva let us go. But da new way, us guys get Godʼs Spirit in charge a us! Az why us guys can work fo God now. Da Bad Kine Stuff Dat Stay Inside Us</verse>
				<verse number="7">So den, wat mo we can say? Da Rules no good, o wat? Not even! If I neva undastan da Rules, den no way I go undastan wat kine stuff stay bad inside me. Jalike I neva know I not suppose to like get odda peopoʼs stuffs fo myself, if da Rules neva say, “No like get odda peopoʼs stuffs fo yoaself.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But cuz da Rules wen say dat, den dass jalike da bad kine stuff inside me wen make me like get all kine stuffs fo myself. If neva have da Rules, da bad kine stuff no mo power ova peopo.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Da way I wen stay live befo time, I neva know da Rules. Den bumbye, I wen find out dat God wen say dat get tings I not suppose to go do -- an right den an dea, jalike all da bad kine stuff inside me wen wake up an make me go do dose tings!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Den, az jalike I wen mahke inside. Had da Rules so dat peopo can come alive fo real kine. But den fo me, jalike was da Rules dat wen cut me off from get um right wit God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Da Rules wen tell how I gotta make awready. But had inside me bad kine stuff dat wen use da Rules dat God say fo bulai me. Cuz a dat, jalike was da Rules dat wen cut me off from get um right wit God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But den same time, da Rules stay spesho fo God, an everyting da Rules say we gotta do, all dat stay spesho fo God, stay right, an good.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Da Rules stay some good. But you tink was da Rules wen cut me off from get um right wit God? Not even! Was da bad kine stuff inside me dat wen go use da Rules fo cut me off from God. Da Rules stay good, but dey show dat da bad kine stuff stay bad fo real kine, an dey cut us off from get um right wit God. So wen God say how us guys gotta make, dat show dat da bad kine stuff inside us no good! Da War Inside Us</verse>
				<verse number="14">We know dat da Rules come from Godʼs Spesho Spirit. But me, I ony one guy. I make jalike I one slave dat gotta do ony bad kine stuff.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I donno wat I stay doing. Cuz, eh, I no do da tings I like do. I do da tings dat I no like.</verse>
				<verse number="16">If I do da tings I no like do, den I know dat da Rules stay good.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Cuz dass not me dat do um, but da bad kine stuff dat stay inside me stay do um.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I know dat no mo notting good inside me. Everytime inside me I like do da bad kine stuff. I like do da good kine stuff, but den, I donno how fo do um!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Da good kine stuff dat I like do, I no do um. But da bad kine stuff I no like do, I do um.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now, wen I do wat I no like, az not me dat make me do um, but da bad kine stuff dat stay inside me.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Dat show, jalike wen get one rule dat say, wen I like do da good kine stuff, get da bad kine stuff inside me dat no like me do um.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I stay real good inside wen I tink bout da Rules from God.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But jalike get one diffren kine rule inside me dat everytime jam me up. Da way I tink, I like do wat stay good, but I no can. Jalike da bad kine rule stay inside my body, an stay make me one prisona dat jus gotta go do any kine bad kine stuff.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Auwe! I stay all sore inside! Jalike no mo nobody dat can take me outa da bad kine stuff befo all dat go cut me off from God!</verse>
				<verse number="25">But you know wat? God, he da One dat can get me outa dat! Mahalo plenny to God cuz our Boss Jesus Christ can do um! So dis how I stay: My own self, I stuck. No matta my head like do everyting Godʼs Rules say fo do -- da way I stay inside, jalike get one nodda rule dat say I gotta do bad kine stuff.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">So den, God no goin punish da peopo dat stay tight wit Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Cuz get two tings dat stay fo real: First ting, if you stick wit Godʼs Spirit, he goin make you come alive fo real kine an make you stay tight wit Jesus Christ. Da odda ting is dat if you stick wit da bad kine stuff, you goin cut yoaself off from God. Now, if you get Godʼs Spirit, Godʼs Spirit cut you loose from da bad kine stuff.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Even if we do wat da Rules from God say, dat no can throw out da bad kine stuff inside us, cuz da way us guys stay, we not strong inside. But den God, he wen go send his own Boy fo come one guy jalike us. Da way Jesus wen stay, God wen make him look jalike one regula guy dat can do bad kine stuff, jalike all da odda peopo. But den, Jesus neva do bad kine stuff -- how he wen live, he wen show proof dat da tings da peopo was doing was bad fo shua. Plus, he wen come one sacrifice fo hemo da shame fo da bad kine stuff dat all da odda peopo wen do.</verse>
				<verse number="4">God wen send Christ fo mahke so us guys can do all da right kine stuffs Godʼs Rules say we gotta do. Now, we stay doing da kine stuff Godʼs Spirit like us do, not da kine stuff we do wen we live da way we like.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Da peopo dat live da way dey like, dey live lidat cuz dass how dey stay inside, an dass da ony kine stuff dey tinking bout all da time. But da peopo dat live da way Godʼs Spirit like, dey ony tinking bout da kine stuff dat Godʼs Spirit like.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Da guy dat ony like tink bout doing da bad kine stuff he like do, jalike he stay mahke inside awready. But da guy dat ony like tink bout doing wat Godʼs Spirit like, he stay alive fo real kine, an his heart stay rest inside.</verse>
				<verse number="7">An if you ony like tink bout doing da kine stuff you do wen you live da way you like, cuz dass how you stay inside, you ony going agains God everytime, you know. Dat mean, you not doing wat Godʼs Rules say -- cuz you no mo da power fo do um.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Da peopo dat ony stay doing da bad kine stuff dey like do, no way God goin like wat dey doing.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But you guys, you guys da one dat no stay doing da bad kine stuff you do wen you live da way you like. If Godʼs Spirit stay live inside you, you guys stay doing da kine stuff Godʼs Spirit like. Whoeva no mo Christʼs Spirit inside him, dass da guy dat not Godʼs guy.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But Christ stay tight wit you guys. You guys spirits stay alive fo real kine, cuz you guys get um right wit God. So, no matta you guys goin mahke cuz you guys wen do bad kine stuff.</verse>
				<verse number="11">God da One dat wen make Jesus come back alive afta he wen mahke. If Godʼs Spirit stay tight wit you guys, den he goin make you guys come back alive, yoa body, everyting, jalike how he wen make Christ come back alive. His Spirit goin do dat fo you guys, no matta yoa body gotta mahke. Godʼs Spirit Tell Us We Godʼs Kids</verse>
				<verse number="12">So den, bruddas an sistas, we gotta do someting. But we no need do notting fo da bad kine stuff inside us, da way our bodies like make us do.</verse>
				<verse number="13">If you guys go ack jus da way you stay inside, fo shua kine you goin cut yoaself off from God! But den, if you let Godʼs Spirit help you kill off all da bad kine stuff you do wen you live da way you like, den you goin live fo real kine.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Da peopo dat listen to Godʼs Spirit so he can tell um wat fo do, dem guys Godʼs kids.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Wen you guys get Godʼs Spirit in charge a you, Godʼs Spirit no goin make you guys ack jalike slaves dat gotta stay scared all da time. Az how was befo time. Wen you get Godʼs Spirit in charge a you, you know you stay Godʼs kids! Dass why he goin listen wen we yell out, “Daddy!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Jalike our own spirit tell us inside, Godʼs Spirit tell us we Godʼs kids.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Cuz us guys Godʼs kids, dat mean, we goin get all da good kine stuff God goin give his kids, cuz he our Fadda. Jalike da Fadda give everyting he get to Christ, his Boy, an dass how he goin make to us guys, same time he give um to Christ. Ony one ting: us guys gotta suffa jalike Christ wen suffa, so den bumbye, God make us come awesome jalike he wen make Christ come awesome. Bumbye God Goin Make Us Come Awesome</verse>
				<verse number="18">You know, I figga dat da stuff we stay suffa right now, az notting! Cuz da awesome stuff God goin show us bumbye, dat goin be unreals!</verse>
				<verse number="19">All da tings dat God wen make, jalike dey ony stay watching real hard, cuz dey waiting fo see wen God goin show everybody he proud who his kids stay.</verse>
				<verse number="20">All da tings God wen make, he wen figga, first, everyting gotta come all hamajangs an stay lidat. Not suppose to be lidat, an God know fo shua dat bumbye he goin make all dat stuff come okay one mo time.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Right now, all da tings dat God wen make, dey stay stuck hamajang kine, an stay coming all pilau kine. But bumbye, God goin do awesome tings fo get um outa dat, so dey can come jalike suppose to be. Same time, God goin do awesome tings fo get all his kids outa da pilau kine stuff too.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Us guys know, from befo time till now, all da tings God wen make stay making noise jalike dey get big pain, jalike wen one wahine goin born one baby an she stay suffa plenny.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Eh, us guys too, no matta we get da Spirit in charge a us dat God wen give us first ting, jalike we still yet make big noise inside us lidat too. We make lidat cuz we still yet waiting an watching real hard fo da time wen God goin make us his kids to da max, an goin hemo loose our bodies from all da pilau kine stuff.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Wen God wen take us outa da bad kine stuff, he wen make us know fo shua wat he goin do bumbye. But still yet, we gotta wait. If we see someting happen, den we no goin wait fo dat same ting fo happen. Nobody goin stay wait fo someting dat wen pau happen awready.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But wen we stay waiting fo someting we no can see still yet, den we still goin hang in dea an wait some moa.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Same ting, Godʼs Spirit help us plenny, cuz we no mo power. We donno how fo pray da right way. But Godʼs Spirit, he go take ova an aks God fo do good tings fo us, no matta we jalike get big pain inside dat make us so we donno how fo say um.</verse>
				<verse number="27">An God, he know all da tings dat us guys like say inside our heart, an he know how his Spirit tink. Dass how God know everyting his Spirit like say fo help us, cuz Godʼs Spirit tink jalike God tink, an da Spirit talk to God an aks him fo help da peopo dat stay spesho fo God.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Us guys know dis too: God make everyting come out all good fo da peopo dat get love an aloha fo him. Befo time, God wen go make plan wat he goin do fo dem, an he wen tell um awready, “Come wit me! Be my guys!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Befo time, he wen pick dose peopo awready, cuz he like make um come da kine peopo jalike his Boy. Godʼs Boy, dass Christ. He da main one, an da odda guys, dey jalike his younga bruddas an sistas.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Dat same peopo God wen pick befo time lidat, he wen tell um fo come be his guys. An dose same guys, God wen make um get um right wit him, an he wen make um come awesome jalike him. God Get Love An Aloha Fo Us Guys</verse>
				<verse number="31">So den, wat we goin say bout all dat? God stay fo us guys to da max. Cuz God stay lidat, who going agains us? No mo nobody!</verse>
				<verse number="32">God neva even hold back his own Boy. He wen make um one sacrifice fo help all us guys. God wen give his own Boy fo mahke fo us. You know, dat mean God no hold back notting. He give us every good ting to da max!</verse>
				<verse number="33">An den, who goin poin finga da peopo God wen pick? No mo nobody fo do dat! Cuz God, he da One dat say dat his peopo get um right wit him awready.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Eh! No mo nobody dat can say God gotta punish all da peopo he wen pick. Jesus Christ, he da One dat wen go mahke. An mo importan den dat, he da One dat God wen make um come back alive afta he wen mahke. From dat time, he stay da mos importan place, by Godʼs right side. Same time, Jesus da One dat stay aksing God fo help us guys!</verse>
				<verse number="35">You tink get somebody o someting dat goin make Christ no get love an aloha fo us guys? No way! You tink presha, hard time, o wen get somebody dat like hurt us, o wen no mo notting fo eat, o no mo clotheses, o wen we scared, o wen we get peopo dat like kill us? Not even!</verse>
				<verse number="36">Jalike da Bible wen say, “Cuz we yoa peopo, Everytime dey try kill us. Dey tink we jalike sheeps dey goin kill.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Cuz Christ get love an aloha fo us guys to da max, no matta wat kine trouble get, no bodda us, cuz we da winnas fo shua!</verse>
				<verse number="38">I shua bout dis: No mo notting can make God stop loving us guys. No matta if we stay alive o we mahke, no matta if get angel guys o leada guys in da sky, o if get spirits wit power dat go agains us, no matta wateva stay happen now o goin happen bumbye,</verse>
				<verse number="39">no matta get guys wit power up dea inside da sky, o down dea inside da groun, no matta get all kine odda kine tings dat God wen make -- no mo notting dat can hemo us from God, so he no love us no moa! Cuz us guys stay tight wit Jesus Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, an he our Boss.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Eh, I no bulai you guys, I ony tell da trut cuz I stay tight wit Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. Same ting my heart tell me, you know, an Godʼs Spirit stay in charge a my heart.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I tell you guys dis: Inside, my heart stay plenny sore, an no can stop hurting. My heart stay lidat, cuz I feel fo my own peopo.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I like my own peopo, da Jews, come tight wit Christ too. Fo dem, I like even go aks God fo punish me, an not dem, an cut me loose from Christ, so dat my peopo can come tight wit Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Dey da Israel peopo. God wen make dem his own kids from befo time. He wen show dem how awesome he stay. He wen make all kine deals wit dem. He wen give um his Rules. Dey da ones dat know how fo go down in front him an show him respeck how suppose to. God wen promise fo do plenny good kine stuffs fo dem.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Da Jewish peopo wen come from our ancesta guys, da main fadda guys Abraham, Isaac, an Jacob (dass Israel, you know). An Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, he wen born from da same fadda guys too. Christ, he da One az God, an he da One dat stay in charge a everyting. He da kine Guy dat peopo like talk good bout him foeva! Dass right!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now, I not saying dat wat God wen say no goin happen. Cuz da peopo dat wen born from our ancesta guy Israel, inside, all dem guys not da fo real kine Israel peopo, you know.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Same ting, get plenny peopo dat wen born from our ancesta guy Abraham, but not all dem Abrahamʼs kids fo real kine. Cuz God wen tell Abraham, “Da ony peopo dat I goin call yoa kids fo real kine, goin be da ones dat goin born from yoa boy Isaac.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Dat mean, from befo time, from all da kids dat wen ony born from our ancesta guy Abraham till now, not all dem Godʼs kids, but ony da kids dat God wen promise fo born from Abraham, dey da ones dat God call his kids fo real kine.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Dis wat God wen say wen he wen make da promise: “Same time nex year I goin come back, an Sarah goin born her baby boy.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">An dass not all, you know. Our ancesta guy Isaac an his wife Rebecca, dey wen get twin boys. Dey both Isaacʼs kids.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But you know, befo Rebecca wen born her twin boys, an no matta her twin boys neva do notting good o bad yet, God wen tell Rebecca, “Da twin boy dat goin born first, he da one dat goin work fo da boy dat goin come out afta.” He wen tell her dat fo show dat wen God pick somebody, he pick um cuz he know wat he goin do wit dat guy. God jus wen tell um fo come be his guy. He no need wait till he find out how dat guy goin ack, cuz God know awready.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Jalike God wen say inside da Bible, “I wen pick Jacob, but I neva take Esau.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So den, wat we goin say? Dat God no treat everybody same same? Not even!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Cuz God wen tell Moses, “I goin give chance to da ones I give chance to, An I goin show pity fo da ones I pity.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Dass why, no matta wat one guy do, o wat he like happen, ony one ting matta -- dat God da One dat give um chance.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Da Bible tell wat God wen say to da King Pharaoh inside Egypt. He say, “I wen make you King, cuz I wen like use you fo show how strong I stay, an fo make peopo all ova da world tell wat kine God me!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">So den, if God like give one guy chance, dass wat he do. An if he like make one guy hard head, az wat he do too. God, He Give Chance, But Den, He No Take Any Kine (Da Start 19; Outa Egypt 9:16; 33:19; Isaiah 1:9; 10:22-23; 29:16; 45:9; Jeremiah 18:6; Hosea 1:10; 2:23)</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now, somebody goin aks me dis: “Eh! If dass how stay, how come God still yet poin finga peopo? Cuz no mo nobody can go agains wat God like fo happen, you know.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Eh, who you tink you? How come you talk back lidat to God, brudda? Jalike da Bible wen tell: “If get one guy dat making one ting, da ting no can tell da guy, ‘Eh! How come you wen make me lidis?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Da guy dat make pots, he get da right fo use da clay fo make spesho kine pots. O if he like, he goin use da same kine clay fo make pots fo put junk kine stuff inside.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Same ting wit God. He like show everybody dat he no take any kine stuff da peopo like do. He like make shua everybody know he get plenny power. Fo show dat, fo long time he put up wit any kine stuff from da peopo dat do da kine stuff he no take. But dose peopo dat make lidat, ony ready fo get wipe out.</verse>
				<verse number="22">An he wen do dat cuz he like show dat he goin give chance to some peopo. Dey da ones dat he wen make ready fo come awesome. He like make shua everybody know dat he stay awesome to da max.</verse>
				<verse number="23">An you know wat? Us guys, we da peopo he wen tell dis: “Eh! Come wit me! Be my guys!” Some a us guys come from da Jewish kine peopo, an he wen tell us fo come. Odda guys, dey come from da odda kine peopos.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Jalike God wen say befo time inside Hoseaʼs book inside da Bible, “Get peopo dat not my peopo, But still yet I goin call um ‘my peopo.’ Goin get one nation dat I neva have love fo, But den, I goin call um ‘da nation I get love fo.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Hosea wen say dis too: “Right dea, Da same place wea God wen tell um befo time, ‘You guys, you not my peopo no moa!’ Dass da same place wea da God dat stay alive goin tell um bumbye, ‘You guys, you my kids now!’ ” Cuz he wen give um chance, az why.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Befo time, Isaiah wen talk fo God inside da Bible. He say, “Get choke peopo dat get Israel fo dea ancesta. Da ohana big, jalike da sands on top da beach, No matta God goin take ony litto bit peopo Outa da bad kine stuff dey stay doing.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Cuz da Boss goin pau do everyting he wen say he goin do, All ova da world. He no goin wase time notting!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Befo time, Isaiah wen say dis too: “Good ting, God, da Boss Fo All Da Armies, Wen let some a our kids stay alive. If he neva do dat, our blood pau, Jalike da peopo from Sodom town an Gomorrah town.” Da Israel Peopo An Da Good Kine Stuff From God (Isaiah 8:14; 28:16)</verse>
				<verse number="29">So den, wat? Wat we goin say? Get all kine peopos from diffren place dat not Jews, dey neva was trying fo get um right wit God befo time. Now, dey get um right wit him, cuz dey stay trus um.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But da Israel peopo was trying fo ony do wat Godʼs Rules say, fo get um right wit God, but dey no can do um.</verse>
				<verse number="31">How come dey neva get um right wit God? Cuz dey wen ony try get um by da stuff dey wen do, but dey neva have trus fo God. Da Bible wen talk bout one “rock dat make peopo trip ova an fall down.” Dis wat Isaiah wen say inside da Bible: “Eh! Right hea inside Zion Town, dass Jerusalem, I goin put one Guy. He goin be jalike one rock Dat goin make peopo trip ova an fall down. But whoeva go trus dat Guy, Dey no need come shame.” An jalike da Israel peopo wen trip ova dat rock an fall down!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Bruddas an sistas, you know wat I like happen fo da Israel peopo? I aks God plenny fo dem, so dat da Israel peopo goin let God hemo dem from da bad kine stuff dey stay doing. Wen dat happen, dass wen I goin feel real good inside my heart!</verse>
				<verse number="2">You know, I can tell you dis bout dese peopo: Dey like go all out fo God, an dey try make lidat, but den, dey donno da main stuff dat dey suppose to know first.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Dey donno wat God wen do awready fo all us guys get um right wit him. So dey go try fo get um right wit God how dey like, an dass why dey no like listen to him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Christ wen do everyting fo us get um right wit God. Wit ony da Rules, no can do dat. Now, whoeva go trus Christ, dey da ones dat goin get um right wit God. God Like Take Everybody Outa Da Bad Kine Stuff Dey Stay Doing Da Prieses 18:5; Da Rules Second Time 30:11-14; Isaiah 28:16</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now Moses, he wen go write inside da Bible how fo get um right wit God if da peopo do everyting wat da Rules say. Dis wat Moses wen say: “Whoeva go do everyting da Rules say, cuz dey do dat, dey goin get life fo real kine.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Da Bible say someting diffren den dat too, bout how you get um right wit God cuz you trus him. Da Bible say: “No good you go tink inside yoa head, ‘Eh, who going up dea inside da sky?’ ” Eh, dass jalike da guy going up dea fo tell da Spesho Guy God Wen Send dat we like him come back down hea by us guys.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Same ting, da Bible say: “No good you tink inside yoa head, ‘Who goin go way down inside da groun by da Deep Dark Hole wea da mahke peopo stay?’ ” Eh dass jalike da guy going down dea fo bring Christ back from mahke.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But you know, da Bible say, “Da main ting God wen say, stay right dea. Awready stay inside yoa mout an inside yoa heart.” Dass da same ting us guys stay teaching: Eh, gotta trus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Dat mean, if you talk strait wit yoa own mout, “Jesus, he my Boss,” an you trus deep inside yoa heart dat God wen bring Christ back alive afta he wen mahke, den God goin hemo you from da bad kine stuff you stay doing.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Cuz az wit yoa heart dat you trus God, an den he make you get um right wit him. An az wit yoa mout dat you talk strait everybody dat Jesus stay yoa Boss, an den God goin hemo you from da bad kine stuff.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Jalike da Bible say, “Whoeva trus God, no way dey goin come shame, cuz God goin do everyting wat he say.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Da Jewish peopo an all da odda peopos, dey all same same. No mo diffrence. Cuz get da one Boss, an he da Boss fo everybody. He goin do plenny fo everybody dat aks him fo kokua dem.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Cuz da Bible say, “Everybody dat aks da Boss fo help um, he goin take um outa da bad kine stuff dey doing.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">But eh! How dey goin aks him fo help um if dey no trus him? An how dey goin trus him if dey neva hear notting bout him? An how dey goin hear bout him if nobody eva go tell um notting bout him?</verse>
				<verse number="15">An how dey goin tell peopo if nobody send um fo go teach? Jalike da Bible say, “Wen peopo go fo tell da Good Stuff From God, eh! dass so awesome!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But you know, wen get Israel peopo dat neva like listen to da Good Kine Stuff From God. Jalike Isaiah wen say inside da Bible: “Eh Boss! No mo nobody dat like go trus Da tings dat dey wen hear from us guys!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">So den: Fo trus God, gotta listen to da tings he say. An fo listen to wat God say, first gotta hear bout Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Try let me aks dis: You guys tink da Israel peopo neva hear notting, o wat? Fo shua dey wen hear! Jalike da Bible wen say befo time: “All ova da world, get peopo dat wen hear da Good Stuff. Da tings dey say, wen go all ova da place wea get peopo.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">An I aks one nodda ting: “Da Israel peopo, you tink dey neva undastan notting?” Moses da first one dat wen go tell inside da Bible, dat God wen say dis: “I goin do someting fo some odda peopos Dat not jalike you guys, An dat goin make you guys jealous. An I goin do someting fo peopo dat you guys tink stupid, An dat goin make you guys come huhu.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Isaiah wen come strong fo tell um strait inside da Bible dat God wen say, “Da peopo dat no look fo me, Dey da ones dat wen find me. I even wen show myself To da peopo dat neva aks fo see me.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">But da Israel peopo, dis wat he wen say bout dem: “All day I wen put out my hands, Waiting fo da Israel peopo fo come by me, But dey no like listen. Dey ony like go do someting else.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">So den, I like aks dis: God wen no like his peopo no moa, o wat? Not even! Me, I from dat same Israel peopo! I get da same blood jalike Abraham, an I get da same blood jalike Benjamin, cuz Abraham Benjaminʼs great granfadda.</verse>
				<verse number="2">No, God neva say he no like his peopo no moa. Dey da ones he wen pick from befo time. You no rememba wat da Bible wen say bout Elijah? Da guy Elijah, he was aksing real hard fo God fo do someting agains da Israel peopo.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He tell: “Eh Boss! Da guys you wen send fo talk fo you, Dese da peopo dey wen kill! Da altar wea dey make sacrifice fo you, Dey wen go bus um up. Me, I da ony guy dat talk fo you Dat stay alive still yet. But den, dey still yet stay trying fo kill me too!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">An wat God wen say to him? He say dis: “I still get 7,000 guys dat stay my guys. Dey no go down in front da idol kine god Baal!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Nowdays, same ting -- get some peopo dat God wen pick jus cuz he like do someting good fo um an give um chance.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Fo shua, he like give um chance, an dass why he wen pick um. No was cuz dey wen go do someting good, an dass why he gotta pick um, you know. If he gotta pick um cuz a da good tings dey wen do, den he no give um chance fo real kine, an he gotta pick um, az why.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So wat, den? Da Israel peopo wen like get um right wit God, but dey no can do dat. Ony da peopo God wen pick wen get um right wit him. Da oddas, dey ony wen come mo hard head still yet an dey no listen to God.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Dis wat da Bible wen say befo time: “God wen make um come Jalike dey no can tink o feel notting. Dea eyes no can see notting, Dea ears no can hear notting, Right up till now.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">David wen say dis inside da Bible: “No matta dey party up at dea own table -- I like God make dat party jalike one trap Fo catch um an pay um back!</verse>
				<verse number="10">I like God make dea eyes close so dey no can see notting! I like he bend um down to size!” God Goin Make Da Peopo Dat Not Jews Come Okay</verse>
				<verse number="11">So den, I like aks dis: How come da Jewish peopo wen go mess up? Was fo make um wipe out, o wat? No way! But afta dey wen go do da way dey not suppose to an no trus God, dat wen mean, now all da odda peopo dat not Jews can get outa da bad kine stuff dey stay in. An dat make da Israel peopo come jealous.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Fo shua, da Israel peopo wen make like dey not suppose to. An cuz dey wen do dat, dat wen mean, da odda peopo all ova da world get all kine good tings from God. Da Israel peopo, dey wen lose everyting, an cuz a dat, all da peopo dat not Jews wen come jalike dey rich! Kay den -- bumbye, all da Jewish peopo goin come strait wit God, an den, everyting goin come mo betta still yet!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now fo you guys dat not Jews, I like say dis one ting: God wen send me all ova da place by da odda peopos dat not Jews, fo talk fo him. Dis job God give me stay real importan!</verse>
				<verse number="14">You know, might be, if I do good job, I can go make my own kine peopo come jealous, an den, dass how I can help some a dem come outa da bad kine stuff dey stay in.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Wen God neva take his own peopo befo, dat wen mean dat da odda peopos all ova da world wen get chance fo go da same side wit God. Bumbye, wen God take back his own peopo, goin be jalike dey was mahke befo, but now dey wen come alive fo real kine!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Eh, you know, if you take litto bit bread, an give um to God, den da whole bread stay spesho fo him too. If you give da root from one tree to God, da whole tree stay spesho fo him too.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jalike da Jewish peopo was one olive tree, an God wen hemo some branches from dat tree, an den he wen plant odda branches on top dat tree. You guys dat not Jews, you jalike one nodda kine olive tree dat grow wild outside one olive tree farm, but God plant you on top one good tree inside da farm. Jalike da odda branches, you get da same kine good tings from God, jalike da Jewish peopo.</verse>
				<verse number="18">You know, you betta not get big head an tink dat you mo betta den da odda branches dat God wen hemo! If you get big head, rememba dis -- you not da one dat make da tree strong, cuz you ony one branch. Dass da root dat make you strong!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Den might be you goin say, “Eh, God wen go hemo one branch so I can go stay same place wea dat branch was.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yeah but, God wen hemo dose branches cuz dey no trus God, az why. An you, you stay dea cuz you trus God. Eh, no get big head! Mo betta you be scared!</verse>
				<verse number="21">Da Jewish peopo, dey jalike da branches dat wen grow dea first -- but God neva let um stay dea. An you? You tink he goin let you stay ova dea if you no stay trus him? Not even!</verse>
				<verse number="22">So, tink bout dis: God get good heart -- but same time, he can punish hard. He goin punish hard da guys dat no get um strait wit him. But wit you guys dat not Jews, God get good heart fo you guys if you stick wit God an let him be good to you. But if you no let him get good heart fo you, he goin hemo you from da tree too.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Same ting wit da Jewish peopo, if dey change dea heart, an start fo trus God, God goin plant dem togedda on top da main olive tree one mo time. God can go plant um back, jalike dey was befo time.</verse>
				<verse number="24">You know, you peopo dat not Jewish, you jalike one branch dat wen get hemo from one olive tree dat wen grow wild outside da farm. God wen plant you inside da good olive tree, no matta dass not da tree wea you wen grow first time. Mo betta still yet, da Jewish peopo, God goin plant um back, inside da same tree wea dey wen grow first time. Da Israel Peopo Goin Get Um Strait Wit God Isaiah 27:9; 59:20-21</verse>
				<verse number="25">Bruddas, dis someting you guys gotta know, dat was secret befo time. If you undastan um, den you no going get big head cuz you tink you smart. Dis da ting dat was secret: Da Israel peopo, dey wen come hard head an neva like trus God now, but den, dey no goin stay lidat foeva. Bumbye wen all da peopo dat not Jews goin trus God, den da Jewish peopo, dey goin go trus um too.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Dass how dat time, all da Israel peopo, God goin take um outa da bad kine stuff dey stay in, jalike God wen say inside da Bible befo time: “Goin get one guy dat goin take us outa da bad kine stuff, He goin come from Jerusalem, Zion side. He goin make da peopo dat come from Jacob tink diffren kine, Dem guys, dey ack jalike God no matta, Bumbye, dey no goin tink lidat no moa.</verse>
				<verse number="27">An I goin hemo dea shame fo da bad kine stuff dey wen do. I goin make one spesho deal wit dem”</verse>
				<verse number="28">So, da way da Israel peopo ack weneva dey hear da Good Kine Stuff From God, jalike dey stay agains God everytime. An cuz dey making lidat, dat give you guys chance! No matta, God still yet get love an aloha fo dem, cuz he wen love dea ancesta guys an pick dem fo come his peopo.</verse>
				<verse number="29">You know, wen God give you someting, he no take um back. Wen he tell you, “Eh! Come wit me! Be my guy!” -- he no goin change his mind.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Befo time, you guys dat not Jewish neva like do wat God wen tell you fo do. But now, you guys get chance, cuz da Jewish peopo da ones dat no like do wat God tell um.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Right now, da Jewish peopo no like do wat God tell um fo do. Cuz a dat, God stay give you guys chance. Same ting lidat, God goin give da Jewish peopo chance too.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Right now, God make everybody same same, so dey no can do wat he tell um, jalike dey stuck. He do dat, fo give chance to everybody, same same. God, He So Good! Isaiah 40:13; Job 41:11</verse>
				<verse number="33">Ho, da smart God stay! God, he know how fo use all his smarts! He get choken plenny fo help us guys! No mo nobody dat can figga how God tink Fo do da tings how he like! No mo nobody can undastan Why God do da stuff he do! Jalike da Bible wen say befo time:</verse>

				<verse number="35">An no mo nobody dat give God tings Dat goin make God pay him back!”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Eh, everyting come from God! Everyting happen cuz God make um happen! Everyting us guys do, We do um fo him! Everytime we like say, He da greates, An he goin stay da greates foeva! Az right!</verse>

				<verse number="9">God, he da One dat wen tell you guys fo come tight wit his Boy, our Boss Jesus Christ, an God everytime do wat he say. Get Church Peopo Dat Like Split Up</verse>
				<verse number="10">Eh, bruddas an sistas! I talking fo our Boss Jesus Christ wen I beg you guys fo tink da same way, an no split up. Gotta stick togedda, so you guys know how fo tink da same way, an can figga out tings da same way!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Some peopo from Sista Cloeʼs house wen tell me dat some a you guys stay make argue wit each odda.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Dis how I figga. Sound like you guys stay talking lidis: One guy say dis, “Me, I stick wit Paul!” One nodda guy say, “Me, I stick wit Apollos!” An anodda guy say, “Me, I stick wit Peter!” An dis odda guy go say, “Me, I stick wit Christ!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So, wat? No can split up Christ ohana, you know! Eh! You guys tink was me dat wen go mahke on top da cross fo you guys? No way! You guys tink wen dey baptize you, dat make you guys my guys, o wat? Not even!</verse>
				<verse number="14">I tank God dat I neva baptize nobody ova dea by you guys. Ony da guys Crispus an Gaius.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Dass why nobody ova dea can say dat dey wen get baptize fo come Paulʼs guys.</verse>
				<verse number="16">-- Oh yeah, I rememba dis, I wen baptize some peopo in Stefanas house too. But I no can rememba if I wen baptize odda peopo ova dea by you guys.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Eh, you know, wen Christ wen send me, no was ony fo baptize! Da main ting he wen send me fo, was fo tell all da Good Kine Stuff Bout Him! An he neva like me talk bout him jus fo sound smart. Cuz if I wen jus talk smart kine da way peopo tink, dat goin take away da power from wat wen happen wen Christ wen go mahke on top da cross. Christ Get Power From God (Isaiah 29:14)</verse>
				<verse number="18">All da stuff we telling bout how Christ wen mahke on top da cross, dat stuff sound stupid to da peopo dat stay going wipe out fo real kine. But fo us guys, he taking us outa all da bad kine stuff we stay in. So den, da stuff bout Christ an da cross get plenny power from God fo help us guys.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Dass jalike wat Isaiah wen write inside da Bible befo time: God say, “All dis stuff da smart guys know, I goin make um come jalike notting. No matta how smart dey stay, I goin make everyting dey know jalike no good.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">So wat den? Wat goin happen to da smart guys? An to da teacha guys dat teach da Rules? An to da guys dat nowdays can talk good an make you tink anodda way? Eh! God wen make all dem guys look stupid! He wen make all da smarts dat come from dis world come jalike notting!</verse>
				<verse number="21">You know God, he so smart, he neva let da peopo inside dis world figga how dey can know him fo real kine. Cuz da kine smarts dey get inside dis world, not nuff. God, he figga lidis: mo betta send some guys aroun fo tell da peopo bout him, no matta get peopo dat tink da guys he send kinda crazy fo talk lidat. But God figga dat from da stuff his peopo tell, odda peopo can go trus him, an dass how he goin take um outa da bad kine stuff dey stay doing.</verse>
				<verse number="22">You know, da Jewish peopo, dey everytime like us guys fo do someting awesome fo show proof dat we get Godʼs power. An da Greek peopo, dey ony like hear da smart kine stuff dat dey tink az da trut.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But us guys dat talk fo God, we stay tell peopo all ova da place how God wen send dis Spesho Guy Christ ova hea, an how odda guys wen hang um on top one cross an kill um. Da Jewish peopo, wen dey hear dat, dey no can handle, cuz dey tink Godʼs Spesho Guy no goin mahke eva. An da Greek peopo, wen dey hear um, dey tink, “Dass stupid!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">But get odda peopo, some a dem Jewish peopo an some a dem not Jewish, dey da ones God wen tell fo come be his peopo. Fo dem, Christ show um dat God get plenny power an he stay real smart.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Cuz no matta da peopo tink God stupid, he still mo smart den dem. No matta dey tink God not strong, he still mo strong den dem.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Eh, bruddas an sistas! Fo undastan wat I mean, tink bout wat wen happen wit you guys wen God wen tell all you guys fo come be his spesho peopo. If you tink da way da peopo inside da world tink, no mo plenny guys wit you guys dat get plenny smarts, o get da kine power fo make odda peopo do wat dey like. No mo plenny guys wit you guys dat come from one ohana wit big name.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But God wen pick da peopo dat odda peopo from dis world tink lolo. Cuz he goin make da smart peopo look shame, dass why. An da peopo dat look like dey not strong hea inside dis world, God wen pick dem, cuz he goin make da strong kine peopo look shame too.</verse>
				<verse number="28">He wen pick da peopo dat no mo big name hea inside dis world, an da kine dey make fun of, an dose dat no mean notting to nobody. God goin use dem fo make da peopo who tink dey it, come jalike notting.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So dat nobody can talk big wen dey stand in front God.</verse>
				<verse number="30">You guys know how come you guys stay tight wit Jesus Christ? Cuz God like, dass why! God, he wen make Jesus da One dat can give us guys all his smarts. An Jesus make us guys get um right wit God, an come peopo dat stay spesho fo God, an he cut us guys loose from da power da bad kine stuff get ova us!</verse>
				<verse number="31">So den, jalike da Bible wen say befo time: “Anybody like talk big, mo betta dey ony talk big bout da Boss, an not bout demself!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Eh bruddas an sistas! Wen I wen go by you guys first time, I wen tell you guys all da kine stuff from God dat nobody eva wen know befo time. But I neva ack like I mo betta den you guys. An wen I wen talk to you guys, I neva talk jus fo make me look smart.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Wen I was wit you guys, I wen figga lidis: I ony know one ting, an dass Jesus Christ. He da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, but was him da peopo wen hang on top one cross fo kill um. An dass da ony ting I know fo shua.</verse>
				<verse number="3">You know, da first time, wen I wen go ova dea by you guys, I wen feel like I not strong, an I was scared an shaky.</verse>
				<verse number="4">No matta I was teaching, o I was talking to plenny guys, same ting, aah? I neva like talk jus fo make da peopo tink, “Eh, we can trus wat dis guy telling us, cuz he know how fo talk real good, yeah?” No ways, brah! But wen I wen talk, I wen show you guys dat I get da Spirit in charge a me, az why I get power.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Cuz I figga, no good you guys go trus God jus cuz you hear smart kine stuff dat peopo tell. Mo betta you trus God cuz he get da power, an you see wat he can do. Da Smart Kine Stuff God Teach Us</verse>
				<verse number="6">Fo shua, wen us guys talk to da peopo who stay solid inside, we teach um smart kine stuff. But we no teach da same kine smart stuff da peopo inside da world stay teach nowdays, o da kine stuff da leada guys tink too. (Dem leada guys, dey all goin wipe out, you know.)</verse>
				<verse number="7">Us guys, we teach ony da smart kine stuff dat come strait from God. Cuz God wen hide um from da peopo befo time, but from da start he wen figga he goin let us guys know um, so bumbye we goin come awesome.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But da leada guys dat stay in charge nowdays, dey neva undastan. If dey wen undastan, fo shua dey no goin hang our awesome Boss on top da cross fo kill um.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So da smart kine stuff from God stay hide from befo time, jalike da Bible wen tell, “Get tings you neva see, Get tings you neva hear bout, You no can even tink how unreal dis ting goin be. Dass da kine stuff God wen make ready Fo us guys dat get love an aloha fo him.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">But us guys, God show us all da stuff we neva know befo time, cuz Godʼs Spirit stay in charge a us. Da Spirit, he undastan everyting. He even check out how God stay, deep down inside him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Us guys, we all get our own spirit inside us. Dass how we know how we tink an ack. Same ting wit God -- no mo nobody know how God stay inside, but Godʼs own Spirit, he know.</verse>
				<verse number="12">You know, us guys, we get Godʼs Spirit in charge a us. Dass why we no tink da same way da peopo dat get da spirit from inside dis world tink. Inside us, we get da Spirit dat come from God, az why. God like us know all da good kine stuff he wen give us guys.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Dass da kine stuff us guys stay talk bout. Us guys teach da stuff Godʼs Spirit teach us. We no need talk fancy kine, jalike how da smart guys like talk wen dey teach. But us guys, we put togedda da tings dat come from Godʼs Spirit fo da peopo dat stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Dass why, if get one guy dat no mo Godʼs Spirit in charge a him, ony his own self, dat guy no goin like take da kine stuff dat come from Godʼs Spirit. He goin tink, “Az wase time!” No way da guy goin undastan. Gotta stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit fo check out if dat kine stuff az da trut.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Da guy dat stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit, he can check um out wateva. But same time, all da odda peopo, dey no can check out dat guy.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Jalike da Bible wen say: “Who can figga out wat God stay tinking, aah? O who can teach God wat he suppose to do? No mo nobody!” But us guys, we know, cuz Christ help us guys tink jalike he tink.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">But eh, bruddas an sistas! I no can talk to you guys jalike you stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit. Cuz you guys ony like do wat make yoa body feel good. You guys stay tight wit Christ ony litto bit, jalike one baby.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I gotta tell you guys easy stuff, jalike da baby ony stay drink milk. Cuz you guys not ready fo da hard kine stuff, jalike da baby no can eat meat. You guys suppose to be strong, jalike you stay eat da meat awready! An still yet, you guys ony stay drink da milk.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Cuz you guys stay tink jalike da peopo dat ony ack how dey like, dass why. Wen somebody do someting mo betta den you, you get mad, an you like argue wit each odda an bus up each odda! Kay den, wateva yoa body feel, dass how you guys tink an ack! You guys ony stay ack jalike all da peopo inside dis world.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Everytime wen you guys tell you stick wit Paul, o you stick wit Apollos, dat show dat you guys jalike all da odda peopo. You Guys Jalike One Garden</verse>
				<verse number="5">Apollos, who him? Paul, who me? Me an him, we jus helpas. We wen help you guys fo trus Christ. Apollos, he do wat da Boss like um fo do, an me, I do wat da Boss like me fo do.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Was me dat wen tell you guys bout Christ first time. Dass jalike I wen plant da seed. Den Apollos wen come teach you guys. Dass jalike he water da seed I wen plant. But God, he da One dat make um grow!</verse>
				<verse number="7">So den, dass why no matta who plant da seed, o who water um. Ony one ting matta, dass God, cuz he da One dat make um grow.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Da guy dat plant da seed an da guy dat water um, dey working togedda jalike one hui. Everybody goin get pay fo wat dey do.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Cuz us guys an God, we work togedda. An you guys, you jalike da groun wea God goin plant da seed. You Guys Jalike One Building An same ting, you guys jalike da building God goin build.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Me, God do plenny good stuff fo me. Jalike I one good builda, God wen help me teach you guys solid stuff from da start, fo make shua you guys get one solid foundation fo yoa life. But da guy dat goin build on top dat foundation afta me, he gotta make shua he goin do um da right way.</verse>
				<verse number="11">No can make any kine foundation, cuz ony get one foundation fo life -- dass Jesus Christ. God awready wen put him dea.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Some peopo goin build on top dat foundation, wit good kine stuff, stuff jalike gold, o silva, o diamonds -- o dey goin build wit junk kine stuff, stuff jalike wood, o grass, o leaf.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Bumbye, everybody goin know wat kine stuff dem peopo wen do, if was good o bad. Dat time, God goin make one test, jalike he use fire fo show if wat everybody wen do was jalike good kine stuff o junk kine stuff.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If da stuff one guy wen do stay dea still yet afta da fire, God goin give dat guy plenny good kine stuff bumbye in da sky.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But if da fire burn up wat da guy wen do, God no goin give dat guy notting. Still yet, da guy goin be okay, but ony jalike da house burn down an da guy almos neva get out.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Eh! You know, you guys jalike one temple fo God, an his Spirit stay living inside you guys!</verse>
				<verse number="17">If anybody mess up Godʼs temple wea he stay, watch out, brah! Bumbye God goin mess you up too! Cuz Godʼs temple stay spesho fo him. An you guys, jalike dat temple!</verse>

				<verse number="19">Da way da peopo inside da world tink, God say dat stuff stay stupid. Da Bible say: “Da smart guys, dey sly buggas, But God take wat dey do an jam um up!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">One nodda place da Bible say: “Da Boss, he know how da smart guys stay tinking, Da guys dat suppose to know wat fo do. He know dey ony tinking junk kine stuff dat wase time.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">So den, no good talk big bout some guy. Cuz everyting stay fo you guys awready.</verse>

				<verse number="11">Even now we stay hungry, but we still no mo food, an no mo notting fo drink. We ony get puka kine clotheses. Peopo beat us wit sticks. We no mo place fo stay.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Eh, we work hard wit our hands. Wen dey talk any kine to us, we tell um, “We like God do good tings fo you guys.” Wen dey bus us up an make us suffa plenny, we still hang in dea.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Wen dey talk stink bout us, we talk good to dem. Dey tink us guys pilau. We jalike da rubbish from da world dat dey like throw way.</verse>

				<verse number="3">No matta I no stay dea wit you guys, my heart stay dea. So, I awready wen judge da guy dat wen do dis bad ting.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I get da right fo do dat cuz Jesus our Boss, an I his guy. So you guys, come togedda. Den you guys get da right fo ack fo da Boss. An my heart goin be right dea wit you guys too.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Den, hand dis guy ova to da Devil, so da bad kine stuff inside da guy goin get wipe out. Den wen Jesus, da Boss, come back, Jesus goin take da guy outa da bad kine stuff he stay in.</verse>
				<verse number="6">No good you guys get big head! You guys donno dat ony litto bit yeast inside da bread dough can make da whole ting come big? Da yeast, dass jalike da bad kine stuff dat guy stay doing. An dat goin make da odda church peopo come bad too.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Take out da guy from da church. Den you guys goin come jalike one new kine guy dat no mo notting bad inside. Dass how you guys stay. Dey wen kill Godʼs Spesho Guy, an dat make us guys clean inside, jalike wen dey wen kill one spesho baby sheep fo da Passova sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Us guys, we jalike da Bread Dat No Mo Yeast Inside, dat da Jewish peopo make fo eat Passova time. So us guys gotta watch out dat we no do da bad kine stuff, o hurt da odda peopo. We wen make lidat befo time. Mo betta tell da trut everytime, so everybody can see dat we do everyting wit good heart.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jalike I wen tell you guys inside my letta befo time, “No hang aroun da kine peopo dat go fool aroun.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">I no stay talking bout da peopo inside da world dat donno God, o da peopo dat like get everyting fo demself, o da peopo dat rip off da odda guy, o da peopo dat pray to da idol kine gods. Fo no stay aroun dat kine peopo, you gotta go one nodda planet!</verse>

Dat kine guy, no do notting wit him -- no even eat wit um!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Afta all, dass not my job fo make like da judge fo da peopo dat no trus God. But you guys suppose to be da judges fo da peopo inside da church, yeah?</verse>
				<verse number="13">God goin be da Judge fo da peopo outside dat no trus him. But you guys, jalike da Bible say, “Da guy dat say he one a Godʼs guys, but still yet stay doing da real bad kine stuff, throw out da bugga!”</verse>
			</chapter>

				<verse number="2">You guys ack like you donno dat bumbye, da peopo dat stay spesho fo God goin be da judge fo all da peopo inside da whole world. So how come you guys no can figga out dis small kine stuff by yoaself?</verse>
				<verse number="3">You know, all us guys goin even be da judge fo da angel guys. So den, gotta be you guys can handle fo judge da small kine stuff inside dis world.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Plus, if you guys get one beef agains one nodda brudda bout small kine stuff, den, how come you guys go pick peopo fo be da judge dat get no mo respeck from da odda church guys?</verse>
				<verse number="5">An now, I like say someting dat goin make you guys shame: No even get one smart guy ova dea dat can figga out da small kine stuff dat da bruddas an sistas get wit each odda, o wat?</verse>
				<verse number="6">But one brudda go take anodda brudda in front da judge! Mo worse, da judge no even trus God!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Someting wrong, aah? Jam up, if you guys take each odda in front da judge. Mo betta, you let da odda guy go if he wen do wrong to you! If he steal from you, mo betta, jus let um take da stuff!</verse>
				<verse number="8">But you guys, you do bad kine stuff to each odda, an steal from each odda too, an dey yoa Christian bruddas an sistas, an den!</verse>
				<verse number="9">You guys ack jalike you donno dis: Da peopo dat no like do da right ting, no way dey goin get God fo dea King. No let nobody bulai you guys fo make you do wrong! Da guys dat fool aroun da wahines, da peopo dat go pray to da idol kine gods, da peopo dat sleep wit da odda guyʼs wife o husban, da guys dat go fool aroun da odda guys fo money, da mahu kine guys,</verse>
				<verse number="10">da steala guys, da greedy guys dat like hog everyting fo demself, da drunk guys, da peopo dat talk any kine to one nodda guyʼs face, da peopo dat con da odda guy -- fo all dese kine peopo, no way dey goin get God fo dea King!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Dass how some a you guys wen do befo time. But God, he wen make you guys clean from all da bad kine stuff you wen do. He wen make you guys come spesho fo him. He wen make you guys get um right wit him. All dat wen happen cuz you guys stay tight wit da Boss Jesus, Godʼs Spesho Guy, an wit our Godʼs Spirit too. If You Show Respeck Fo Yoa Body, Dat Show You Get Respeck Fo God (Da Start 2:24; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 10:23; 2 Corinthians 6:16)</verse>
				<verse number="12">Eh! Az okay fo me fo do all kine stuff. But, everyting I do, az not good fo me. Fo shua, okay fo me fo do all kine stuff, but I no goin let anyting make me do stuff dass not good.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Peopo say, “Da food fo da belly, an da belly fo da food.” But no matta -- God goin make all dat pau. But you know, yoa body not fo fool aroun wit da wahines o da guys. You get one body so you can work fo da Boss, an da Boss, he da One dat take care yoa body.</verse>
				<verse number="14">God wen make da Boss Jesus come back alive afta he wen mahke, an he get da power fo make us guys come back alive too, afta we mahke.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You guys donno dat yoa body stay fo Christ, jalike you guys was da parts a Christʼs body. So now, wat? You guys tink I goin take da parts from Christʼs body, an make um part a one wahineʼs body dat take money fo fool aroun? No way! Not even!</verse>
				<verse number="16">You guys neva know dat wen one guy come togedda wit one wahine dat take money fo fool aroun, jalike togedda dey make one body. Da Bible say, “Dem two, togedda dey goin be one body.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">But da guy dat stick wit da Boss, jalike togedda dey come one spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If you get chance fo fool aroun, run da odda way! All da odda bad kine stuff anybody do, no jam up dea body. But anybody dat go fool aroun, dey do bad kine stuff dat hurt dea own body.</verse>
				<verse number="19">How come you guys ack jalike you donno dat yoa body jalike one temple fo Godʼs Good an Spesho Spirit? Godʼs Spirit live inside you guys. God da One wen give his Spirit to you guys. Dass how come you guys not da boss fo yoa own body.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Christ wen pay high price fo you guys. So, show respeck fo yoa own body, da way you ack, an dass goin show dat you get respeck fo God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Now I like talk bout da stuff you guys wen aks me inside yoa letta bout da guys an da wahines. Dass good idea, fo one guy no touch one wahine.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But get peopo dat like fool aroun, you know. Dass why mo betta every guy get his own wife, an every wahine get her own husban.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Da husban gotta give his wife wat she need, an same ting fo da wife.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Da wife no ony own her body, but da husban too. Same ting, da husban no ony own his body, but da wife too.</verse>
				<verse number="5">No hold back from each odda. You can fo short time, but ony if da husban an da wife tell each odda dey goin hold back fo get time fo pray. An den come back togedda, so da Devil no can make you guys presha make you fool aroun behind da oddaʼs back. But if you no come back togedda fast, you no goin be strong nuff fo say “No!” to da Devil.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I no telling you guys you gotta hold back, but you can if you like.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I tink mo betta, if peopo no marry, jalike me. But every guy get one spesho power dat God wen give um. He give some peopo da power fo handle if dey marry, an odda peopo da power fo handle if dey no marry.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I like tell da peopo dat not married an da widows: Mo betta you no marry, jalike me awready.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But, if you no can handle, den mo betta get married. Mo betta fo marry den come all hot.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I like tell da married peopo dis (but dis come from da Boss Up Dea, not me): Da wife not suppose to leave her husban.</verse>
				<verse number="11">O if she leave um, she not suppose to marry again, o she gotta go back wit her husban an make tings good. An da husban not suppose to make his wife go way too.</verse>
				<verse number="12">An fo da odda guys, I like tell um dis (dass me talking, not da Boss): If one Christian brudda get one wife dat no trus God, he not suppose to throw her out if she like stay wit him.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Same ting, if one wahine get one husban dat no trus God, she not suppose to leave him if he like her stay wit him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Da husban dat no trus God stay spesho fo God still yet, cuz he stay tight wit da wife dat trus God. An da wife dat no trus God stay spesho fo God still yet, cuz she stay tight wit da husban dat trus God. If no was lidat, den dea kids no stay spesho, but cuz one a da parents trus God, da kids stay spesho fo God too.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But da husban o da wife dat no trus God, if dey like leave, den let um. Da one dat trus God no stay stuck wit da marriage if da one dat no trus God like go. Cuz God wen tell you guys fo come be his guys, so yoa hearts can rest inside.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But if you one Christian wahine, you donno if you no can help yoa husban get outa da bad kine stuff. An you brah, if you one Christian guy, you donno if you no can help yoa wife get outa da bad kine stuff. Stick Wit Da Way Da Boss Wen Give You Fo Live</verse>
				<verse number="17">But stick wit da way Jesus da Boss wen give you fo live, cuz God wen tell you fo come be his guys. Dis da rule I teach all da church peopo every place.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If you get da cut skin mark on top yoa body fo show you one Jew, an den God tell you fo come be his guy, no need change da mark. But if you no mo da mark, an God wen tell you fo come be his guy, no need cut skin.</verse>
				<verse number="19">If you wen cut skin, no matta. If you neva cut skin, no matta, same ting. Main ting, us guys do wat God tell us fo do.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Wen God wen tell you fo come wit him an be his guy, he neva say fo change everyting. Ony stay da way you was.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jalike, if you was one slave wen God wen tell you fo come, no let dat bodda you. If you can get out, den do um. If not, dass okay.</verse>
				<verse number="22">If one guy stay one slave, an da Boss tell um fo come be his guy, he stay tight wit da Boss. No matta da guy one slave still yet, now he work fo da Boss Up Dea. An if da guy no was one slave wen da Boss wen tell him fo come, now he one slave fo Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Christ wen pay high price fo you guys, you know. So no be one slave fo odda peopo.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Eh, bruddas an sistas! Wen God wen tell you guys fo come be his guys, no go make all kine changes. Ony stick wit da way you was. Do um fo God. Da Peopo Dat Not Married</verse>
				<verse number="25">You guys wen aks me bout da peopo dat neva sleep wit nobody. Da Boss neva tell me how dey gotta make, but dis wat I tink. You can trus wat I say, cuz God, he good to me an give me chance.</verse>
				<verse number="26">You know, get plenny trouble an presha nowdays. Dass why I tink, mo betta stay da way you was.</verse>
				<verse number="27">You get one wife? No throw her out. You no mo one wife? No go looking.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But if you marry, you no stay doing notting wrong. If one wahine dat neva marry go marry, she no stay doing notting wrong. But da peopo dat get married goin get problem inside dis world, an I ony trying fo help you guys, so you no suffa.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Eh bruddas an sistas! I like say dis: No mo time awready, if you get one wife o you no moa. Cuz da way da world stay now, goin all pau.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Same ting if you crying o you not crying, if you stay good inside o you no stay good inside, if you can buy stuff o you no mo notting,</verse>
				<verse number="31">o if you use da stuff from dis world, o if you let um go, no big ting. Cuz da way da world stay now, goin all pau.</verse>
				<verse number="32">I like you guys no worry. Da guy dat not married, he get mo time fo tink bout da Boss, az why he can do stuff fo make da Boss stay good inside.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Da married guy, he gotta tink bout da stuff inside da world too. Az why he no can tink good, cuz he like do good fo his wife, an same time tink bout da Boss.</verse>
				<verse number="34">He get two diffren kine tings fo tink bout. Same ting, da wahine dat no mo husban an da wahine dat not married, dey get mo time fo tink bout da Boss, how dey can stay all out fo da Boss, dea spirit, dea body, everyting. But da married wahine gotta tink bout da stuff inside da world too. Az why she no can tink good, cuz she like do good fo her husban, an same time tink bout da Boss.</verse>
				<verse number="35">I telling you guys dis stuff, cuz good fo you guys. I no like jam up you guys. I like you guys do da right ting, an know wat da Boss like you fo do an be ready fo do um, an no worry bout odda kine stuffs.</verse>
				<verse number="36">If get one guy dat stay ready fo marry one wahine, an he figga he making her wait long time, if she old nuff fo marry awready, go ahead. Marry her, if dass wat you like. Dass okay, you no doing notting wrong.</verse>
				<verse number="37">But if get one guy who know wat he like, an he can handle, an wait, an he stay make up his mind fo no get married, dass okay too.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Good ting fo da guy marry her, but mo betta, da guy no get married. Da Widows</verse>
				<verse number="39">So den, da wife gotta stay wit da husban till he mahke. Afta he mahke, she can marry if she like, but ony if da odda guy stay tight wit da Boss.</verse>
				<verse number="40">I figga, I get Godʼs Spirit in charge a me, an dass wat he like me fo say: Mo betta fo her if she no marry.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Now, I like talk bout da meat dat peopo give fo make sacrifice fo da idol kine gods. We all know dat all us guys know plenny bout dis. But you know, if somebody know plenny, dat ony goin make dem tink dey mo smart den anybody. Mo betta get love an aloha fo da odda peopo. Dass wat goin make everybody come mo strong an mo solid inside.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Plus, if peopo dat tink dey know someting awready, dey still donno um da way dey suppose to.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But if anybody get love an aloha fo God, God know dem, an dass wass importan.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So den. Even if da peopo make sacrifice to da idol kine gods, an den somebody go eat dat food, we all know dat da idol kine gods inside dis world not da real God. Jalike da Bible say, “Ony get one God dass fo real, an all da odda gods no mean notting.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Get plenny kine tings inside da sky an inside da world, dat da peopo say dey gods o dey bosses.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But fo us guys, ony get one God, He our Fadda. Everyting come from him, An us guys do everyting fo him. An ony get one Boss, Dass Jesus Christ. Wen God wen make everyting, Jesus da One wen do um, An us guys stay live cuz Jesus wen give us life.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But you know, get peopo dat donno dat. Some peopo, dey still yet tinking everytime bout da idol kine gods, jalike dey wen tink befo time. Dass why, everytime dey eat da meat dat da odda peopo wen use fo make sacrifice fo da idol kine gods, dey tink, “Eh, dis food was one sacrifice fo da idol kine god, you know!” Dey tink, “If I eat dis stuff, I stay doing bad kine stuff!” An dat make dem feel all pilau inside so dey no can pray, cuz dey not strong inside.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Ho! No mo food dat can make us guys come mo close to God, you know. If we no eat um, dat no make us mo worse. An if we eat um, dat no make us mo betta.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But watch out! Jus cuz you get da right fo do someting, dat no mean, dass good dat you do um. If bumbye one brudda o one sista dat no stay strong inside see you do um, an dat goin mess dem up -- den az no good lidat!</verse>
				<verse number="10">You, you know dat all dis stuff okay. But if one brudda dat no stay strong inside see you sitting an eating ova dea inside one temple fo one idol kine god, wat you tink he stay tinking? Fo shua, da guy goin tink dass okay fo him fo eat da food too, from da sacrifice dey wen kill fo da idol kine god.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You know plenny, but you goin make da guy dat no stay strong inside wipe out if you do dat. An dat guy, he one Christian brudda, an Godʼs Spesho Guy wen go mahke fo him, an den!</verse>
				<verse number="12">You know wat? If dass how you guys stay do bad kine ting agains yoa bruddas an sistas, you hurt dem wen dey no stay strong inside. Eh! dass jalike you guys wen do bad kine ting agains Godʼs Spesho Guy Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="13">So den, if I go eat dat stuff, an dat make my Christian brudda o sista jam up, mo betta I no goin eat dat kine meat, eva! Cuz I no like dem come all jam up inside.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Tink bout dis: I can do anyting. God wen send me all ova da place fo tell peopo bout him. I wen see Jesus, our Boss. I stay tight wit da Boss, an all you guys wen trus Christ cuz a da work I wen do.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Even if get odda peopo, God neva send me fo talk to dem. But fo shua, he wen send me fo talk to you guys. If you like proof dat God wen send me, ony gotta check out wat wen happen to you guys now, how you guys stay tight wit da Boss!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Fo da guys dat like poin finga me, I like tell um dis:</verse>
				<verse number="4">You no tink me an Barnabas get da right fo get stuff fo eat an drink from da peopo we teach?</verse>
				<verse number="5">You no tink we get da right fo take one Christian wife wit us wen we go some odda place? Da odda guys God send all ova da place, dey do dat, you know, an da Bossʼs brudda guys, an Peter.</verse>
				<verse number="6">O you guys tink dat ony me an Barnabas, we da ony guys dat no mo da right fo work fo make money so we can teach peopo?</verse>
				<verse number="7">Eh, look da army guys. Dey no gotta buy dea own food an clotheses. An da guys dat plant da grape, nobody goin tell dem, “No eat da grape!” Da sheep farma guy too, az okay fo him fo use da milk from da sheeps.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You guys tink I say all dis stuff, cuz I talking jalike da odda peopo? Godʼs Rules say da same ting, you know.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Inside da Bible, da Rules dat God wen tell Moses fo write, talk lidis: “Wen da cow stay working fo smash da wheat so you can take out da junks, you no go tie up his mout so he no can eat da wheat.” You tink God wen say dat ony cuz he like take care da cows so dey can eat, o wat?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Mo like he talking bout us guys too, fo help us! Yeah, he say dat fo us guys. He say, “Da guy dat plow da groun, an da guy dat take da junks outa da grain, wen dey work, dey gotta wait still yet fo eat. But dey know, bumbye dey goin get dea share.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">You know, wen us guys wen teach you guys stuff from Godʼs Spirit, dass jalike wen one farma guy stay planting stuff. So az notting, wen us guys pau teach, den we get food fo eat from you guys.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Get odda guys dat get da same right fo get food an stuff from you guys wen dey teach, yeah? So, wat bout us guys? We get plenny mo rights den dem. But you know, us guys, we neva use da rights we get. Mo betta we take any kine, fo no jam up you guys. Cuz den, you like listen to da Good Kine Stuff Bout Christ dat we telling you guys.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Tink bout dis: da priest guys dat stay work inside da Jewish temple, dey get dea food from da sacrifices da peopo bring to da temple. Da guys dat stay kill da animals on top da altar fo sacrifice, dey can eat da meat dat da peopo give fo sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Same ting, da Boss wen tell us guys dat da guys dat stay tell da Good Kine Stuff Bout Christ, dey suppose to get all da stuffs dey need fo live, from dea work.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Me, I get da rights fo get all dat, but I neva like do um lidat. I no write dis letta fo make you guys give me stuff. I figga, mo betta I mahke, den let somebody tink dat I no mo da right fo talk lidis.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Jus cuz I stay telling peopo da Good Kine Stuff From God, dat no mean I can talk big bout myself. I gotta tell um bout God. Auwe fo me if I no tell peopo da Good Kine Stuff From God!</verse>
				<verse number="17">If I wen do all dis stuff ony cuz I like, den da stuffs I get, jalike da money I get fo do one job. But if I go do um cuz I gotta do um, den, jalike God stay trus me fo take care his stuffs fo him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So den, wat kine pay I goin get fo do all dat? I no need pay! I ony like tell peopo da Good Kine Stuff From God. I do um lidat an no charge notting. Dat make me feel good, jalike wen one guy get pay fo work. I do um an no need use all da rights dat I get cuz I stay telling da Good Kine Stuff From God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I can do watevas how I like, an no mo nobody can tell me how I gotta ack. But you know wat? Jalike I wen go make myself jalike one slave guy, so everybody can tell me wat fo do. Wen I make lidat, I can help mo plenny peopo fo know God, az why.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Fo da Jewish peopo, I wen make jalike I one Jewish guy, fo help da Jewish peopo fo know God. Fo da peopo dat tink dey gotta stick wit Godʼs Rules, I do wat Godʼs Rules say, so I can help dem fo know God too, no matta I know dat I no gotta do wat Godʼs Rules say fo get um right wit him.</verse>

				<verse number="5">I wen like all you guys talk diffren kine language, you know. But mo betta, I like you talk fo God. Da guy dat talk fo God, he mo importan den da guy dat talk diffren kine language. But dass okay fo talk diffren kine language, if you get somebody fo tell wat da guy mean wen he talking lidat.

				<verse number="10">Get plenny diffren kine languages hea inside da world, an every language let da peopo tell an undastan wat dey mean.</verse>

				<verse number="16">If you tell inside yoa heart how good God stay an you using diffren kine language, an get one guy inside da meeting dat no undastan wat you saying, how he goin say “Dass right!” wen you tell God, “Mahalo plenny!” wit da odda language? He no can, cuz he no undastan.</verse>

				<verse number="20">Eh, bruddas an sistas! No go tink jalike small kids! (Fo do da bad kine stuff, shua! Ack jalike babies! Cuz da babies, dey donno how fo do bad kine stuff.) But fo undastan wass da main ting, you gotta grow up!</verse>
				<verse number="21">God say dis inside his Rules: “I goin try talk to dese peopo Wit peopo dat talk odda kine languages. But no matta wat I do, dey no goin listen. Dass wat da Boss say.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">An dat mean, wen peopo talk diffren kine language, dass jalike one sign fo da peopo dat no trus God, so dey know wat God can do. Dat kine talk, not fo help da peopo dat trus God awready. But wen God make peopo talk fo him, dass fo help da peopo dat trus God, not fo da peopo dat no trus him.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So, wat? If all you guys come togedda fo church, an you all talking diffren kine language, an get some peopo dat come inside dea dat no mo da power fo undastan dat kine talk, o some peopo dat no trus God, wat dey goin say? Dey goin say, “Dese peopo hea, get some spirit dat wen take ova dem, an dey pupule, fo shua!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">But if all you guys stay talking fo God, an one guy dat no trus God come inside dea, o one guy dat no mo da power fo undastan da diffren kine language, dat guy goin listen to da tings everybody telling. Wat da talka guys say goin make proof to him dat he wen do bad kine stuffs, jalike dey was all judges an know everyting bout him awready.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Cuz da secret kine tings dat da guy no like nobody know, he try hide um inside his heart, but no can, cuz dat stuff goin come outside an everybody goin know. Den he goin go down on his face an give God love an respeck, an tell everybody, “Fo shua, God stay wit you guys!” Do Everyting Da Right Way</verse>
				<verse number="26">Kay den, bruddas an sistas. Wen you guys come togedda, everybody get someting -- one song bout God, o someting fo teach, o fo tell someting dat God like tell dat was secret befo time, o someting fo say talking diffren kine language, o dey can tell wat da odda peopo wen mean wen dey wen talk diffren kine language. Everyting dey do, gotta be fo make each odda come mo strong inside.</verse>
				<verse number="27">If somebody like talk diffren kine language, dass all right, but ony two o three lidat an no moa. One guy no can start till da odda guy pau, an gotta get somebody fo tell wat dey mean wen dey talk diffren kine language lidat.</verse>
				<verse number="28">An if no mo nobody fo tell wat dey mean, den dey not suppose to talk diffren kine language in front da church peopo. Dey ony suppose to talk diffren kine language inside dea own heart, an dey can talk to God lidat too.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Da peopo dat like talk fo God, same ting: two o three guys can talk fo God, an da odda peopo gotta check out how fo do wat dey saying fo demself.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But if get one nodda guy dat stay sitting dea, an God show dat guy someting dat was secret befo, an now da guy like tell wat God show um, den da guy dat stay talking fo God suppose to stop.</verse>
				<verse number="31">All you guys can talk fo God, first one guy den one nodda, you know. Dat way, all you guys goin learn someting, an all you guys goin get good kine words fo feel mo betta.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Da guys dat talk fo God, wen dey get da power from da Spirit fo talk fo God lidat, dey still stay in charge a wat dey say.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Cuz God, he no make us jam up everybody. He make everyting run smooth. All ova da place, weaeva da peopo dat stay spesho fo God come togedda fo church, get dis custom:</verse>
				<verse number="34">Da wahines suppose to stay quiet wen everybody come togedda fo church. Dey not suppose to talk. Dey suppose to show respeck fo da leada guy. Godʼs Rules say da same ting, yeah?</verse>
				<verse number="35">Wen dey get questions, dey can aks dea husbans wen dey go home. Shame, aah? if da wahines stay talking wen Godʼs peopo come togedda fo church!</verse>
				<verse number="36">Wot! If you guys no like, try tink bout dis: Who was da guys dat wen start fo tell wat God say, first time? Was you guys? Nah! O you guys tink you da ony peopo dat eva hear wat God say? Get real!</verse>
				<verse number="37">Anybody figga dey one talka fo God, o day stay tight wit da Spirit, dey gotta know dis: Da stuff I writing to you guys, dass da stuff dat da Boss wen tell us guys we gotta do.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Anybody no listen to dat, den you guys, no listen to dem.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Bruddas an sistas, all dis mean: -- go all out fo talk fo God! An no go tell peopo dey no can talk diffren kine languages.</verse>

				<verse number="13">Eh! If da peopo dat mahke no goin come back alive, dat mean, Christ neva come back alive, too!</verse>
				<verse number="14">An if Christ neva come back alive, den all da stuff us guys stay telling da peopo, dat no mean notting, an wase time if you guys trus him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Plus, dat show dat us guys bulai wen we tell peopo how God stay, cuz we tell um dis bout God: “He wen make Christ come back alive afta he wen mahke.” Dass wat we tell um. But if da mahke peopo no can come back alive, den gotta be, God neva make Christ come back alive, cuz Christ wen mahke.</verse>

				<verse number="22">But everyting gotta happen da right time, you know. Christ, he da first guy dat wen come back alive, jalike da first fruit dey pick from da farm. Bumbye, wen Christ come back hea, his peopo goin come back alive too.</verse>
				<verse number="23">An afta, everyting goin pau. Dat time, Christ da King goin wipe out all da spirits dat say, “Me, I da leada! I stay in charge a everyting! I get da right fo make how I like! I strong!” Same time, Christ da King goin turn ova everyting to God his fadda.</verse>

				<verse number="36">Wen you plant um, you not planting someting dat look like da ting dat goin grow, yeah? You plant da dry seed, wheat seed o some odda kine seed.</verse>
				<verse number="37">But God, he da One dat make da seed, an he figga wat da plant goin look like wen come up. Every diffren kine seed, wen start fo grow, goin look diffren.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Jus cuz you call plenny kine tings “one body,” dat no mean dey all da same kine ting. Da peopo, dey get one kine body. Da animals, dey get one nodda kine. Da birds, one nodda kine. Da fishes, one nodda kine.</verse>
				<verse number="39">An get diffren kine tings inside da sky an inside da world. Da tings inside da sky, dey stay awesome, but dey diffren den da tings inside da world. An da tings dat get body hea inside da world, dey all awesome too, but dey diffren den da tings inside da sky.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Da sun awesome, but not same kine awesome jalike da moon. An da moon stay awesome, but not jalike da stars, yeah? An da stars, dey awesome too, but diffren kine awesome. An da way one star shine, one nodda star shine diffren, but all stay awesome still yet, yeah?</verse>
				<verse number="41">Wen da mahke guys come back alive, same ting goin happen jalike wit da seed, you know. Dey put da guyʼs body inside da groun an he come rotten. But wen da guy come back alive, he no goin mahke eva!</verse>
				<verse number="42">Wen dey put da dead body inside da groun, ony ugly. But wen da guy come back alive, he goin be awesome! Wen dey put da body inside da groun, da guy no can do notting. But wen he come back alive, he goin be strong awready!</verse>
				<verse number="43">Befo dey put da dead body inside da groun, was one guy dat can ony tink an feel, yeah? But afta he come back alive, goin be Godʼs Spirit dat make da guy live fo real kine! Get peopo dat can ony tink an feel, you know, an get peopo dat get real kine life from Godʼs Spirit. An dey get diffren kine bodies.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Dis wat da Bible wen say befo time: Da first guy dat was jalike us guys was Adam. He “wen come alive an he wen tink an feel.” But da last Adam kine guy is Christ. He get one spirit inside him dat can make odda peopo come alive fo real kine too.</verse>
				<verse number="45">First ting, get da guy dat can ony tink an feel. Den latas, get da guy dat get da real kine life from Godʼs Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Da first guy Adam wen come from da groun. God wen make him from da dust. Da odda guy Christ, he wen come from da sky.</verse>
				<verse number="47">An us guys dat come from da dust, we jalike dat odda guy Adam dat God wen make from da dust. But da peopo dat stay tight wit God in da sky, dey stay jalike da Christ guy dat wen come from da sky.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Us guys, right now we look jalike da Adam guy dat God wen make from da dust. Bumbye, we goin come jalike da Christ guy dat come from da sky, too.</verse>
				<verse number="49">Eh bruddas an sistas! Let me tell you guys someting. Peopo wit blood an bones inside, not nuff fo come Godʼs kids an get him fo dea King! Peopo wit body dat goin come rotten, dey no can handle da good kine stuff dat no goin come rotten eva.</verse>

				<verse number="51">Dis all goin happen real fast, mo fast den you can blink yoa eye. Goin happen bumbye, wen time fo blow da last trumpet. Goin get da noise from da trumpet. Right den, da mahke guys goin come back alive. No way dey goin mahke an come rotten one mo time! Same ting wit us guys, we all goin come diffren.</verse>
				<verse number="52">All dis stuff dat goin come rotten, gotta come diffren kine, so bumbye no come rotten one mo time. Dis body dat can mahke now, gotta come diffren kine, so no can mahke eva again!</verse>
				<verse number="53">Dat time, wen da body dat can come rotten now, goin come diffren kine, an no goin come rotten eva again! Da body dat can mahke now, goin come diffren kine, an no goin mahke eva again! Dat time, goin happen jalike da Bible wen say befo time: “We no goin mahke no moa, Cuz Christ, he da winna ova dat!” an</verse>
				<verse number="54">“Da Devil dat like make us guys mahke, He wen lose awready! We no goin cry inside, Cuz da Devil no can zap us guys mahke no moa!”</verse>
				<verse number="55">How come he can zap us guys now an we mahke? Cuz we wen do da bad kine stuff, az why. An how come da bad kine stuff we do, get plenny power lidat? Cuz Godʼs Rules show dat da bad kine stuff stay plenny wrong, az why.</verse>

				<verse number="11">Cuz I no like da Devil trick us. We know he one sly bugga. Why Paul Worry Wen He Stay Troas Town</verse>
				<verse number="12">Dat time, I wen go Troas, an da Boss Up Dea wen let me teach da Good Stuff From Christ dea.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But I wen get funny kine feeling bout someting, cuz I no can find my brudda Titus ova dea. So I wen tell da Troas peopo bye, an wen go Macedonia. Christ Help Us Win</verse>
				<verse number="14">I wen worry, but no matta wea I stay, I like tell God “Mahalo plenny!” cuz Christ, he wen fight an win ova da bad kine stuff, an us guys stay tight wit him. Dass how come God everytime let peopo see dat we his guys. Az how, wen we tell da peopo bout Christ, dass jalike wen someting smell real good, an everybody can smell um.</verse>
				<verse number="15">An God like us guys, cuz we jalike one sweet smell dat make him tink bout Christ. Da peopo dat God goin take outa da bad kine stuff, an da peopo dat goin cut demself off from God, jalike dey can smell dat sweet smell too.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Wen da peopo dat goin cut demself off from God see us, dat make dem tink bout how dey goin be cut off from God bumbye. Wen da peopo dat goin get life to da max fo real kine see us, dat make dem tink bout how dey goin stay alive fo eva. Eh! Who stay big nuff fo handle all dat? No mo nobody, fo shua!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Us guys, we not like plenny odda peopo dat ony teach wat God say so dey can make money. No way! Wen us guys talk, everybody can see dat we fo real, an dat da stuff we say come from God, an dat we stay tight wit Christ.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">If you guys tink we starting fo talk big bout ourself some moa, we not! If you guys tink we need lettas to you guys o from you guys, fo tell dat we good guys, jalike da odda guys need, we no need um!</verse>
				<verse number="2">We get one letta awready, an dass you guys, you know. Da stuff we know bout you guys, stay inside our heart awready. Everybody know you guys, jalike dey reading one letta.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Stay clear dat you guys, you stay jalike one letta dat Christ wen write, an dat he wen give to us guys fo bring ova hea. Christ neva use ink fo write um, he wen use da Spesho Spirit from da God dat stay alive fo real kine. Christ neva write um on top one flat stone da way da Boss Up Dea wen do um fo Moses -- da ting Christ wen write on top, dass someting dass alive, I mean jalike he write um inside da peopoʼs hearts so dey know um.</verse>
				<verse number="4">We know we can trus God dat all dis stuff stay true, cuz Christ wen show us.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Our own self, we no can say dat we get da power fo do anyting. Da ony power us guys get, come from God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">God da One wen make us da kine workas dat can tell peopo bout Godʼs New Deal. Dat New Deal not bout sticking wit some rules, but sticking wit Godʼs Spirit. If you ony stick wit da Rules, jalike you mahke inside, you no get da real kine life dat stay to da max foeva. But if you stick wit Godʼs Spirit, you live fo real kine.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Da time God wen carve da Rules on top da flat stone, was awesome, you know. (But no matta you do wat dose Rules say, still yet you goin cut yoaself off from God.) Den, afta Moses wen get da Rules, his face wen shine so plenny, was so awesome, dat da Israel peopo no can stay look at um. But den da shine wen go way.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So den, wat Godʼs Spirit do inside our hearts stay plenny mo awesome den dat!</verse>
				<verse number="9">You know, cuz a da Rules we mahke, but still yet da Rules stay awesome. Godʼs Spirit help us get um right wit God, an dat even mo awesome.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Da Rules dat everybody wen tink stay awesome, jalike dey not awesome now, cuz get someting dat stay even mo awesome.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You know, da Rule kine stuff stay awesome. Dey awesome jalike Moses face an den da shine wen go way. Still yet, dey stay awesome. But dose tings dat stay foeva, dat kine stuff stay mo awesome still yet. (Outa Egypt 34:34)</verse>
				<verse number="12">All us guys know fo shua dat Godʼs New Deal goin stay foeva, dass why we no mo shame fo talk strait out.</verse>
				<verse number="13">We no need ack jalike Moses. He wen cover up his face so da Israel peopo no can see da shine go way.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Da Israel peopo, God wen make um hard head so dey no can tink good. Even right now wen dey read inside da Bible bout da Deal from befo time dat God wen make, jalike dey get cover ova dea head, cuz dey no like listen, an no can undastan. No mo nobody can make um listen an undastan, ony Christ can.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Even now still yet, weneva da Jewish peopo read wat Moses wen write, dey listen, but dey no undastan, cuz dey no listen inside dea hearts, jalike dey get cover ova dea hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But weneva somebody start fo trus da Boss, Christ help um undastan inside dea hearts. Jalike da Bible wen tell bout Moses, “He take away da ting dat cover his face.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Inside da Bible, wen Moses wen talk bout “Da Boss,” he mean Godʼs Spirit, same ting. Wen we get da Spirit from da Boss Up Dea, we can talk to God any time we like.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Az how he change us fo come awesome jalike him, mo an moa. An our faces no stay cover up, an now we can stay tinking plenny bout how awesome da Boss stay. Da Spirit from da Boss Up Dea, dass how he help us.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">God wen give us guys chance, so he wen give us dis job fo tell peopo bout his New Deal. Dass why we no give up.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So dis wat we do: we tell everybody we no goin do da bad kine stuff some odda peopo do. Dey do um wen nobody can see, an dey no mo shame. We no try bulai nobody. We no try teach fake stuff bout wat God say, but we goin teach da true stuff strait out. Den everybody can go check us out demself, an dey can see wat kine guys us in front God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If get peopo dat no undastan da Good Stuff From God dat we teach, dey da peopo dat goin wipe out.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Da Devil, he jalike da god fo da peopo nowdays. He wen make some peopo jalike dey blind inside dea heads. Az da peopo dat no trus da Boss who fo real. Dass jalike dey no can see da light. Dey no can undastan da Good Stuff bout how awesome Christ stay. Christ, he o same like God. He jalike one picha fo show how God stay.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Us guys no talk plenny bout ourself. We talk plenny bout Jesus Christ da Boss. We ony say dis bout ourself: us guys come fo kokua you guys, cuz we Jesus guys.</verse>
				<verse number="6">God wen say, “From da dark place, I like da light shine,” an he wen make his light shine inside our hearts. God like give us da light. Dat mean, wen we tink bout Christ, we know how awesome God stay.</verse>
				<verse number="7">We get plenny rich kine stuff from God inside us, no matta we jus regula kine peopo. Dat show dat da big power come from God an not from us guys. Dass jalike wen somebody get rich kine stuff inside cheap clay bowls.</verse>
				<verse number="8">We get plenny presha from all ova, but we still can handle. We no can undastan everyting, but we no give up.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Get guys dat make us suffa plenny, but God no leave us by ourself. Dey bus us up, but dey no wipe us out.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Every place we go, da way us guys suffa an get bus up, show how plenny Jesus wen suffa wen he wen mahke. An cuz our body no mahke no matta we get bus up, dat show dat Jesus still stay alive now.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Every day, us guys dat stay alive, we almos mahke cuz we Jesus guys. An dis way everybody can see dat Jesus give us real kine life, no matta our bodies goin mahke bumbye.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So den, us guys no scared fo talk fo Christ, no matta we can mahke cuz a dat, so dat you guys can stay live fo real kine.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Inside da Bible, get somebody dat tell, “Cuz I wen trus God, dass why I wen talk.” Us guys tink togedda same ting: Cuz we trus God, dass why we talk.</verse>
				<verse number="14">We know dat da God dat wen make our Boss Jesus come back alive from mahke, he goin make us guys come back alive too, cuz we stick wit Jesus. God goin put us guys an you guys dea in front him, wea he stay.</verse>
				<verse number="15">God do all dis stuff fo help you guys. He goin do plenny good kine stuff fo mo an mo peopo, an dey goin tank him plenny, an tell how awesome he stay. We Trus God Everytime</verse>
				<verse number="16">Dass why us guys still can handle an no bum out. No matta our bodies stay coming junk outside, but inside God stay making us mo strong every day.</verse>
				<verse number="17">We get plenny big time trouble now, but you know wat? Wen we tink bout how we goin come awesome foeva, all dat trouble, ony manini kine stuff!</verse>
				<verse number="18">So we looking at an tinking bout da kine stuff you no can see, not da kine stuff you can see. Da stuff you can see, ony goin stay litto wile. But da kine stuff you no can see, dat kine goin stay foeva.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Eh, we know dat our body, da one we stay inside now on top da earth, jalike one tent dat ony goin stay up litto bit. No matta dat body goin come wipe out, we no need worry, cuz God get one good place fo us fo stay inside da sky. Peopo neva make dat place. God wen make um, an stay foeva.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So we tink plenny bout get our place da come from da sky.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Wen we get dea, dass jalike we no goin stay wit notting on, cuz den, we goin come new kine, jalike we goin put on new kine clotheses.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now we stay ova hea inside dis world, an we bum out, cuz we get hard time. We like put on da new kine clotheses -- minas get rid a da old kine. Minas we goin mahke. Main ting, we goin come alive fo real kine!</verse>
				<verse number="5">God, he da One wen make us ready fo all dis. He wen give us his Spirit fo proof dat goin happen.</verse>
				<verse number="6">An dat make us feel real good inside, an no mo worry, no matta we know dat all da time we stay alive inside dis body, we no stay wit da Boss in da sky.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Da way we live, we trus God everytime, no matta we no can see him.</verse>
				<verse number="8">We feel good inside bout dis. Dass why we figga, mo betta leave dis body hea, an go live up dea wit da Boss.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Dass why dis da mos importan ting fo us guys: fo do wat God like, no matta we stay ova hea, o we go up ova dea wit God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You know, we all gotta go in front Christ da Judge, an no can hide notting. Dat time we goin get back wat we wen do wen we wen stay inside dis world, da good kine stuff o da no good kine stuff. We Come Friends Wit God Cuz a Christ</verse>
				<verse number="11">We get choke respeck fo God. Dass why we try help da peopo get same kine respeck fo him. God know how we stay inside. I like you guys know inside yoa hearts how we stay inside too.</verse>
				<verse number="12">We not trying fo make ourself look good again in front you guys. But we tell you guys all dis so you can talk big bout us, an no mo shame. Den you guys goin know wat fo say to dem guys dat talk big bout wat dey can see, an not bout wat stay inside da heart.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Maybe you guys tink dat we talking lolo kine. Bodda you, o wat? We do um fo God, an God know we not lolo! An if we talking strait, we do um fo help you guys.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Christ wen get choke love an aloha fo us guys, dass why we like do wat we gotta do. We know fo shua dat one Guy wen mahke fo all da peopo, an dat mean, jalike everybody wen mahke.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Christ wen mahke fo everybody, so dat da peopo who stay alive no goin do stuffs ony fo demself no moa. Dey goin do everyting ony fo Christ, da Guy who wen mahke fo dem an wen come back alive.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So, from now on, we no tink bout nobody da same way odda peopo tink. No matta befo time we wen tink bout Christ da same way odda peopo tink. Now, we no tink bout Christ dat way no moa.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Dass why, whoeva stay tight wit Christ, dey one new guy. Da old tings no stay no moa! Look! Da new tings wen come.</verse>
				<verse number="18">All dat stuff come from God. He wen bring us back da same side wit him, cuz a wat Christ wen do. An he tell us fo work so da odda peopo can come back togedda wit him too.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Wen Christ wen stay inside dis world, God wen use him fo bring da peopo inside da world back da same side wit God. So, he no make dem take da blame fo da way dey wen mess up. An he wen tell us guys all dat, so we can kokua all da odda peopo fo come back togedda wit him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">We da talka guys fo Christ. We tell all da peopo dat God stay begging um fo come back. Cuz we Christ guys, we stay beg you guys, “Eh, come back da same side wit God.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Christ, he neva do notting bad, but God wen make him take da bad kine stuff us guys wen do. God wen do dat fo us guys, so dat we can come right, jalike God stay right, cuz a wat Christ wen do.</verse>

				<verse number="14">No stay wit da kine peopo dat no trus God. Cuz da peopo dat do da right kine stuff, an da odda peopo dat stay agains Godʼs Rules, dey no goin work togedda. Da good kine peopo an da bad kine peopo no can stay tight wit each odda.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Christ an da Devil no can tink togedda da same way. Da guy dat trus God an da guy dat no trus him no can work togedda.</verse>

				<verse number="1">You guys from Galatia, yoa head all jam up! Befo time we wen tell you guys strait out da Good Stuff bout how odda guys wen kill Jesus Christ on top da cross an he wen mahke fo us. But now you guys no listen to da true stuff. Somebody wen put kahuna on top you guys, o wat?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Ony one ting I like you guys tell me: How you guys wen get Godʼs Spirit? Cuz you guys wen do wat da Rules say? O cuz you guys wen trus da Good Stuff From God dat you guys wen hear? Fo shua, cuz you guys wen trus da Good Stuff From God!</verse>
				<verse number="3">You guys not tinking, o wat? You guys wen trus Godʼs Spirit in da beginning. But now in da end you guys goin try fo do everyting wit yoa own power?</verse>
				<verse number="4">All da stuff dat wen happen to you guys -- fo notting? O good fo someting?</verse>
				<verse number="5">God stay give you guys his Spirit, an he do awesome stuff fo you guys wit his power. You tink he do um cuz you guys do wat da Rules say, o cuz you guys trus da stuff you guys wen hear?</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jalike Abraham. He wen trus God. Az why God wen say Abraham get um right wit him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So den, you guys gotta undastan dis: Da peopo dat trus God, dey jalike Abrahamʼs kids.</verse>
				<verse number="8">God wen show inside da Bible dat he goin make all da diffren peopos get um right wit him, cuz dey trus God. So God wen tell Abraham da Good Stuff From God way befo time. He say: “Cuz a you, I goin do plenny good stuffs fo all da diffren peopos all ova da world.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">So den, God goin do plenny good stuffs fo da peopo who trus him, jalike he wen do fo Abraham, da guy who wen trus him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Whoeva try do everyting da Rules say fo get um right wit God, dey get one kahuna on top dem. Cuz da Bible say, “Everybody who no stay do everyting dat Godʼs Rules say we gotta do, dey get one kahuna on top dem.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Stay clear dat no mo nobody dat do everyting da Rules say. Dass why nobody get um right wit God da way God see um. Cuz God wen say inside da Bible, “Da guy dat get um right wit me cuz he trus me, he da one dat goin live fo real kine.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">You know, if you jus do wat da Rules say, dat no mean you trussing God. God wen say inside da Bible, “Whoeva do everyting da Rules say, dey goin live cuz dey stay do um.” But us guys, we no mo da power fo do everyting da Rules say.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Christ, he wen pay da price fo cut us guys loose, so we no gotta do everyting da Rules say fo get um right wit God. Dass why now, we no goin get kahuna on top us. Christ wen get our kahuna on top him, cuz da Bible wen say, “Everybody dat dey kill an hang on top one post, dey get kahuna on top dem.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Christ wen mahke fo pay da price fo us guys, so dat all da diffren peopos all ova da world can get da good stuff God wen promise Abraham, an so us guys who stay tight wit Jesus can get Godʼs Spirit, jalike God wen promise. Da Rules an Wat God Wen Promise (Da Start 12:7; 13:15; 17:7; 24:7)</verse>
				<verse number="15">Eh, bruddas, I goin talk bout someting dat everybody can undastan. If one guy make one will an sign um in front odda peopo, den nobody can change um o make um no good.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So, God wen promise da good stuffs to Abraham an his boy. He neva say, “an fo yoa boys,” cuz dass plenny peopo. He ony say, “an fo yoa boy,” cuz dass ony one guy, Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Dis wat I mean. God wen make da deal wit Abraham long time befo, bout Christ. Den, four hundred an thirty years afta dat, God wen give Moses da Rules. But da Rules no mo power fo make Godʼs promise no good.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If Godʼs kids can get dea share cuz dey work fo um wen dey do wat Godʼs Rules say, den no need God fo promise um dea share jalike one gif. Cuz nobody work fo one gif. But God wen give um to Abraham jalike one gif, jalike he wen promise.</verse>
				<verse number="19">How come get da Rules, den? God wen give um cuz everybody do bad kine stuff. Wen Godʼs Boy wen come, da One da promise talk bout, den fo get um right wit God, no need da Rules no moa. Angel messenja guys wen give Moses da Rules, an den Moses wen give um to da peopo. So Moses wen stay in da middle, fo talk to both God an da peopo.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Need one guy in da middle fo talk to both guys, but no need um if get ony one guy. God stay ony one God, an he wen fix up everyting by himself. Da Rules Teach Us Bout da Bad Kine Stuff</verse>
				<verse number="21">You tink Godʼs Rules stay working agains Godʼs promises? No way! If had rules dat get da power fo make peopo live foeva, den God wen make peopo get um right wit him wit dem rules. But neva had dat kine rules.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Da Bible wen say dat everybody stay do da bad kine stuff, an dey no can pau do um. An dass how come da Bible wen say dat, fo show dat peopo gotta go trus Jesus Christ, fo get da kine life God wen promise.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But befo da time fo trus Christ wen come, we gotta do wat da Rules say, no matta we no mo power fo do um. Dass how wen stay till da time wen come fo God show us how fo trus him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Da Rules jalike one babysitter fo bring us to Christ, so dat we can trus him an get um right wit God.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But now we can trus Christ, so no need one babysitter.</verse>
				<verse number="26">All you guys Godʼs kids, cuz you wen trus Jesus, Godʼs Spesho Guy.</verse>
				<verse number="27">All you guys who wen get baptize fo stay tight wit Christ an be his guys, now you goin come like him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Now, no matta Jew o not Jew, slave o not slave, guy o wahine, you guys all da same cuz you stay tight wit Christ.</verse>

				<verse number="2">Da boy get peopo his fadda wen pick fo take care him an his stuffs. He gotta do wat dey tell um till da time come dat his fadda wen pick.</verse>

				<verse number="21">Eh, you guys dat like stick wit da Rules fo get um right wit God, how come you guys no listen to wat da Rules say?</verse>
				<verse number="22">Da Bible tell dat Abraham had two boys, one boy from da slave wahine Hagar an da odda boy from his own wife Sarah dat not one slave.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Da boy from da slave wahine Hagar, he wen born cuz Abraham wen like get one boy. But da boy from da wife Sarah who not one slave, he wen born cuz God wen promise um.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Da two wahines jalike one picha. Dey show da two diffren kine deals dat God wen make wit his peopo. Hagar, da slave wahine, she wen born one slave boy. Now, Hagar, she jalike one picha fo show da deal God wen make wit Moses on top Mount Sinai, wen God wen give Moses da Rules ova dea befo time.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Da wahine Hagar, she jalike Mount Sinai, Arabia side, da Rules place. Dass jalike Jerusalem stay nowdays, cuz da Jerusalem peopo all jalike slaves. Jalike slaves gotta do wat somebody tell um, da Jerusalem peopo gotta do wat da Rules say.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But get anodda Jerusalem inside da sky, dat come from God fo da peopo dat not slaves. Dass jalike our mudda Sarah, who not one slave.</verse>
				<verse number="27">You know, da Bible say, “Da wahine who no can born kids, She can stay good inside. Da wahine who neva suffa from born kids, She can bus out an make big noise. Cuz da wahine, her husban wen dump her, She get mo plenny kids den da wahine who still yet get husban.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Eh, bruddas an sistas, you guys all Godʼs kids too, jalike Isaac, Sarahʼs boy, cuz God wen promise Abraham dat he goin get da boy Isaac an plenny mo kids too.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Dat time da boy who wen born cuz da fadda Abraham like, wen make any kine to da boy Isaac who wen born cuz Godʼs Spirit like. Same ting today.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Wat da Bible say? “Throw out da slave wahine an her boy, cuz her boy no goin get da good stuff da fadda like give his wifeʼs boy.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">So den, bruddas an sistas, we not da slave wahineʼs kids, we da kids from da wife dat not slave. We no gotta stick wit da Rules fo get um right wit God.</verse>

				<verse number="3">Now I goin tell everybody one mo time: Whoeva cut skin so dey get um right wit God, dey gotta do everyting da Rules say fo come good.</verse>

				<verse number="5">Us guys, not like you guys. We trus God, dass why we wait fo him fo make us get um right wit him, cuz we know dat Godʼs Spirit goin help us.</verse>

				<verse number="10">Cuz I trus da Boss, I shua dat you guys no goin tink anodda way. But da bugga dat stay bodda you guys, God goin punish him, no matta who him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Eh, bruddas an sistas, if I still yet wen teach dat we gotta cut skin, den no goin bodda nobody, cuz den Jesus neva need mahke on top da cross. So if I wen teach lidat, den how come dem buggas make me suffa? Cuz I stay teach dat Jesus wen mahke so peopo can come right wit God. An dat bodda dem buggas.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Dem buggas dat stay bodda you guys fo go cut skin, why dey no go chop um all off?!</verse>

				<verse number="18">So, if you guys listen to Godʼs Spirit, den you guys no gotta do wat da Rules say fo get um right wit God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Da bad kine stuff dey like do jus cuz dey peopo stay clear: dey like fool aroun anybody, even anodda guyʼs wife o husban, an do any kine pilau stuff. Dey no shame.</verse>

He help us wait fo da odda guy an stay cool. He help us tink good bout da odda peopo, an like do good kine stuff fo dem. He help us do wat we promise.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He help us make nice to peopo an do um wit good kine heart. He help us stay in charge a ourself. No mo rules dat say you no can do all dat kine stuff.</verse>

An God wen give peopo his Good an Spesho Spirit, so dat diffren peopo can do diffren kine tings. Az jalike how God wen like do um.

				<verse number="5">We talking bout da new world dass goin come. But God neva tell bout da angel guys, dat dey goin be in charge ova dea.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But get one place inside da Bible wea David wen say dis: “God, how come you tink plenny bout us peopo on top da earth? An how come you get aloha fo us peopo?</verse>
				<verse number="7">You wen make da angel guys Ony litto bit mo importan den us peopo. You wen make us peopo awesome An you show us plenny respeck Jalike you put one crown on top our head. [An you wen put us peopo in charge a everyting you wen make.]</verse>
				<verse number="8">You wen make us boss ova everyting.” You know, wen da Bible say dat God wen make us peopo boss ova everyting, dat mean everyting! But right now, wen us guys look aroun, we can see dat us peopo still yet no stay boss ova everyting.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But get one Guy dat “fo litto bit time, da angel guys was litto bit mo importan den him.” Dass Jesus! Cuz Jesus wen go suffa an mahke fo everybody, God “wen make him awesome, an show him plenny respeck, jalike God go put one crown on top his head.” Dass how God wen do plenny fo us, cuz Jesus wen go suffa an mahke fo everybody.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So, good dat God wen make Jesus suffa. Cuz dat make Jesus da bestes kine Leada fo take plenny peopo outa da bad kine stuff dey do, an fo make um come awesome cuz dey Godʼs kids now. An God da One dat wen do um, cuz everyting az fo him, an everyting stay cuz he wen make um.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Jesus make peopo good an spesho fo God. An him an dem, jalike dey all get da same Fadda. Dass why he no mo shame fo call dem “my bruddas an sistas.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Dis wat Jesus wen tell God: “I goin tell all my brudda an sista guys Bout wat kine God you. An wen my bruddas an sistas all come togedda, I goin sing bout you.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">An again, one nodda place, he say dis: “I goin trus God everytime.” An one nodda place, he say dis again: “Look! Dis me! An dese guys, dey Godʼs kids! God wen give dem to me!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now, Godʼs kids get skin an blood cuz dey peopo. Dass why Jesus wen do da same ting fo be jalike dem, wit skin an blood too. He wen do dat so dat wen he mahke, he wen hemo all da power from da Devil, da one dat get power fo kill peopo.</verse>
				<verse number="15">An, Jesus wen make da peopo dat stay scared dat dey goin mahke all da time dey stay alive, so dey no stay jalike slaves no moa. Da Devil make um scared, so dey listen him, jalike dey slaves unda him. But now da Devil no can do dat no moa.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Fo shua Jesus neva come hea fo help da angel guys, but fo help da peopo dat come from da Abraham ohana ancesta guys.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Dass why Jesus gotta come jalike his brudda an sista guys, every kine way. An cuz he jalike dem, he goin come dea Head Priest fo take care all da kine stuff da Jewish head priest guy do fo God. He give da peopo chance, an he da kine guy dey can trus. Cuz az who him, he goin hemo da shame fo all da bad kine stuff da peopo wen do, an bring um back togedda wit God.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Jesus, he had presha fo do bad kine stuff, but he neva. Still yet, he wen suffa plenny cuz a dat. Dass why, now he can help da peopo, everytime dey get presha fo do bad kine stuff.</verse>

				<verse number="9">God wen say, “Yoa ancesta guys wen check me out. Fo find out if I goin bus um. Den fo forty years dey wen see wat I do.</verse>

				<verse number="11">Wat dem guys wen do, I no take dat. So, I wen make one strong promise: ‘No way dem guys eva goin go inside Da land I wen like give um fo rest!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Eh, bruddas an sistas, watch out! Make shua dat nobody get pilau kine attitude, da kine wea dey no trus God, an da kine attitude wea dey no goin like bodda wit da God dat stay alive fo real kine.</verse>

Den no goin get nobody wit you guys dat goin come all hard head. Cuz you know, da bad kine stuff goin bulai you guys, an make you guys come hard head.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You know, God wen make all us guys stay tight wit Christ. But we gotta hang in dea an stay trussing God all da way, jalike wen we wen trus him da first time.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Jalike da Bible wen say, “Today, wen God tell you guys someting, No go come hard head, Jalike yoa ancesta guys wen do, Dat time dey wen go agains Moses.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Who da peopo he talking bout dat wen go agains Moses, afta dey wen hear wat he say? Az was all da peopo dat Moses wen bring outa Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="17">An wen God tell, “Forty years, I wen had it wit dem guys!” who he talking bout? Az was da peopo dat wen go do bad kine stuff, an bumbye dey wen all mahke in da boonies, an dea bodies wen stay dea.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Who da peopo God talking bout wen he wen make dis strong promise: “No way dem guys eva goin go inside da land I like give um fo rest”? Az was da peopo dat no like listen him.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now us guys can figga how come dem guys no can “go inside da land God like give um fo rest.” Cuz dey neva trus God, dass why.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">So den, God wen make one promise, dat he get one place dat he like give us fo “go rest inside.” An dat promise still stay solid. So den, watch out dat some a you guys no mess up, an den you guys no goin get da kine rest God wen promise you guys.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now, we wen hear da Good Stuff From God jalike our ancesta guys. Dey wen hear da Good Stuff too, but dey neva like believe um. Az why da Good Stuff dey wen hear neva help dem.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now us guys dat trus God, jalike we “go inside Godʼs place an rest wit him.” But God wen say befo time bout our ancesta guys: “Wat dem guys wen do, I no take dat! Dass why I wen make one strong promise, ‘No way dem guys eva goin go inside da land I like give dem fo rest!’ ” You know, long time ago, wen God wen make da world, he wen pau do everyting he goin do inside da world. An still yet, cuz dem guys neva trus him, he neva let um go inside da land.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Get one place inside da Bible dat talk bout Day Numba Seven lidis: “Day Numba Seven, az da day God wen rest, afta he wen pau make everyting.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">An in one nodda place inside da Bible, God wen say dis: “No way dem guys goin eva go inside da land I like give dem fo rest!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So, still yet, get peopo dat “goin go inside da place God like give dem fo rest.” Da peopo dat wen hear da Good Kine Stuff From God befo time, dey neva go inside dea, cuz dey neva like trus God.</verse>
				<verse number="7">One mo time, God make spesho one nodda day fo dem. Cuz long time afta our ancesta guys neva like trus God, David wen write down inside da Bible wat God wen say, da same kine tings I jus wen tell you guys. He wen talk bout one time, an dat time, he call um “Today.” He say: “Today, wen God tell you guys someting, Listen good an no come hard head!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">David not talking bout da time Joshua wen take da peopo inside da land, you know. Cuz if Joshua wen give dem rest, den God no need fo talk bumbye bout one nodda kine day fo get rest.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So den, dat mean, get one rest day fo Godʼs peopo still yet, jalike Day Numba Seven, dat time God wen rest.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So, wen God give you his kine rest, take um. Dat mean time fo rest, an you pau do yoa work awready, jalike God wen rest, afta he wen pau do his work.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So den, good us guys really like get dat kine rest, so dat nobody mess up cuz dey no trus God, jalike da peopo dat wen mess up befo time.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Cuz you know, da Stuff God tell us guys get plenny power, an get life. Wat God say goin go inside us mo betta den one sword dat get two side sharp. Goin check out wat we stay tinking, an wat stay inside our heart, an how come we stay doing da kine stuffs we do. Dass jalike one sharp sword dat can open da joints an da bone marrow stuff.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Everyting God wen make, he can see. No mo notting dat can hide so dat he no can see um. Cuz everyting stay open fo him check um out. An God, he da One we gotta tell why we wen do da tings we wen do. Jesus Da Bestes Kine Head Priest Guy Hebrews 2:17-18</verse>
				<verse number="14">Kay den. Now us guys, we get Jesus. He Godʼs Own Boy, an he da bestes kine Head Priest guy. He wen go all da way up inside da sky wea God stay awready! So, all us guys dat say we trus Jesus, we gotta hang in dea an no give up fo trus him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Our Head Priest Guy, Jesus, he undastan how us guys not strong an no can handle da bad kine stuff. Cuz he wen get presha fo do all kine bad stuffs jalike us guys. But he neva.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So den, no need be scared. Us guys gotta make strong fo go in front Godʼs throne, cuz he like do plenny good kine stuff fo help us. He goin give us chance, an wen we need help, he goin give um.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Now, weneva dey pick one guy from da Jewish peopo fo come be da head priest guy, dat guy get da job fo help da peopo do da kine stuffs da peopo gotta do fo God. Dis head priest guy, he give dea gifs to God, an he make sacrifices fo da bad kine stuff dey wen do.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Dis kine guy goin make easy to da peopo dat mess up cuz dey donno wat dey suppose to do. Da head priest guy, same ting jalike da peopo, he not strong too. Dass why he make easy to dem.</verse>
				<verse number="3">An dass why he gotta make sacrifice fo himself jalike fo da peopo, cuz he do da bad kine stuff jalike dem.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You know, dat head priest guy, he get plenny respeck. But nobody can make himself da head priest guy, cuz dass one spesho job. God gotta be da One fo pick da guy, jalike da first time, he wen pick Aaron.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Same ting fo Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. He neva make himself awesome fo come da Head Priest guy. But was God dat wen make um come awesome. God wen tell him, “Today I wen tell Dat you my Boy!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">An get one nodda place inside da Bible dat God talk lidis: “You goin stay one priest foeva, Da Melkizedek kine priest.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Wen Jesus wen stay hea inside da world, he wen pray real hard, an he wen cry real loud, cuz he know dat God can take him outa dea so he no gotta mahke. An God wen listen to him, cuz Christ all da time show him respeck, an ony do wat God say.</verse>
				<verse number="8">No matta Christ Godʼs Boy, wat he wen suffa wen teach him fo listen God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Christ wen come perfeck, an now he da One dat take all da peopo dat listen to him outa da bad kine stuff dey stay doing. An he help um stay perfeck lidat foeva.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Az why God wen make Jesus da Head Priest guy, jalike da Melkizedek kine priest. Watch Out! No Go Da Wrong Way!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Get plenny mo stuffs we like say bout all dis, Christ an da Melkizedek guy. But az not easy fo tell um, cuz you guys no can undastan too good.</verse>
				<verse number="12">You know, time awready fo you guys come teachas. But you guys still yet need somebody fo teach you guys one mo time da easy kine stuffs bout wat God wen say. You guys jalike babies dat need milk, cuz you guys no can handle da solid stuff still yet.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Wat dat mean, “babies dat need milk”? Anybody dat donno wat God say bout doing da right tings, dey jalike one small baby.</verse>
				<verse number="14">An wat dat mean, “handle da solid stuff”? Dat kine stuff fo da grown up peopo. Dose peopo, dey jalike da guys dat stay work out all da time fo come mo strong. Dey stay doing da good kine stuff everytime an not da bad kine stuff. Dass how dey know how fo figga wass good an wass no good.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">So den, nuff awready fo teach da first kine stuff bout Christ. Now we gotta talk bout how fo come solid an grown up inside. No need teach ova an ova da beginnas kine stuff bout how we gotta come sorry fo all da bad kine stuff we wen do dat goin cut us off from God, an no do um no moa. No need teach ova an ova dat everybody gotta trus God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">No need stay teach everytime bout all kine baptisms, no need teach everytime bout putting da hands on top peopo fo show you like God do plenny good tings fo dem, no need teach everytime bout how da mahke peopo goin come back alive, no need teach everytime bout how everybody gotta stand in front God da Judge, an get wat he say, foeva.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So now, we goin leave all da beginnas kine stuff behind, if God let us do um. Den we goin talk bout how fo come solid an grown up inside.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Get peopo dat one time wen see Godʼs light an trut from up dea inside da sky. Dey wen start fo take in da good kine stuff God wen give um, an dey wen get Godʼs Spesho Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Dey wen find out how good da stuff God say. Dey wen feel da power from da time wen God stay in charge a everyting.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But if dey turn away from Christ, den no way dey can come sorry one mo time fo da bad kine stuff dey do, an come back togedda wit Christ. Cuz den, dey demself, jalike dey wen kill Godʼs Boy on top da cross one mo time, an make him shame in front everybody again.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You know, wen da groun take in da water everytime get rain, an make da plants dat da farma guys grow fo da peopo, an da groun come good fo dem cuz a dat, den God goin make dat groun mo good.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But if dat groun grow ony da kine bushes wit kukus an junk stuff, dat land no good! Bumbye God goin say, “Wipe um out an burn um!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">But, my good friends! We talk bout peopo dat go da wrong way, jalike dat land dat stay poho. But we stay shua dat mo betta tings goin happen to you guys, cuz God stay taking you guys outa da bad kine stuff.</verse>
				<verse number="10">God, he everytime do da right ting, so he no goin foget how plenny you guys wen work fo him, an how you guys wen show him love an aloha cuz you know who him. Cuz you guys wen kokua Godʼs spesho peopo, an still yet you guys stay kokua dem.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Same ting, now we like all you guys fo show dat you guys go all out jalike befo time. Den you guys goin hang in dea all da way, an know fo shua dat God goin do everyting he wen promise.</verse>
				<verse number="12">We no like you guys ack jalike you guys no like do notting. Mo betta you guys make jalike da peopo dat bumbye goin get all da stuffs God wen promise his kids, cuz dey trus God an stay hang in dea. Wen God Make Promise, He Do Um (Da Start 22:16,17)</verse>
				<verse number="13">Tink bout Abraham. Befo time God wen make one promise to him. But no mo odda guy mo big den God. Dass why God neva make one strong promise by some odda guy. He wen make um by himself dat he was really goin do um.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Dis wat God wen promise: “Fo shua I goin do plenny good kine stuffs fo you, an I goin give you plenny ohana wit plenny peopo.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So Abraham wen go hang in dea an wait long time, an den he wen get wat God wen promise.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Wen peopo make one strong promise, dey make um by somebody mo big den dem, so den everybody know dat dey goin do um. Dat show dey really mean um. An den wen dass all pau, da odda peopo no can make argue.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Cuz God like show his kids real clear dat da plan he wen make fo dem no goin change eva, he wen make dat strong promise by himself dat he goin do um himself.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Wen God wen do dat, he wen do two tings dat no goin change eva: he wen make one strong promise, an he wen do um himself. An God no bulai notting. He make dat promise cuz he like give us guys plenny good kine words. Dass fo us guys dat stay running to God from da bad kine stuff, so dat we can take da good kine stuff God wen promise he goin give us bumbye. We know he goin do dat, an we goin stay wait fo um.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Wen we trus God an we know he goin do good stuff fo us bumbye, dat make us stay strong an solid inside, jalike wen da boat anchor come stuck on da ocean bottom an den da boat no can move. Wen we trus God lidat, den we can come tight wit him, jalike wen da Jewish head priest go inside da Real, Real Spesho Place wea God stay inside.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Dass wea Jesus wen go befo us guys, da place wea God stay fo real kine, jalike da head priest guy go inside da Real, Real Spesho Place inside Godʼs temple. Jesus wen do dat fo us, cuz he one head priest foeva, da same kine head priest jalike Melkizedek befo time.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Was dat time, dis Melkizedek guy was king fo Salem town, an he was priest fo da Mos Importan God. Now, “Melkizedek,” dat mean, “Da King Who Everytime Do da Right Ting,” an he da King fo Salem, dat mean, “Da King Who Help da Peopo Stay Good Wit Each Odda.” Nobody know who his fadda guys o his mudda guys, o who his ancesta guys. Nobody know wen he wen born o wen he wen mahke. Dat mean he jalike one picha a Godʼs Boy, cuz he stay one priest guy, jalike Jesus stay one priest guy foeva. One time, had some kings an dea army guys dat wen go rip off plenny stuff from da peopo dat live near Abraham. Abraham dem wen go fight an win ova dose kings an dea army guys. Dey wen take back all da stuffs. Den wen Abraham was coming back, Melkizedek wen go out from Salem Town fo meet him. An dass wen Melkizedek wen tell Abraham, “Eh! God goin do plenny good kine tings fo you.” An Abraham, he wen give Melkizedek ten percent a all da stuffs he wen take back, cuz Melkizedek one priest guy.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Tink bout dis: Melkizedek was one real importan guy. He was so importan dat our ancesta guy, Abraham, even wen give him da bestes ten percent from all da stuffs he wen take back wen he wen fight da kings.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now, all da Jewish priest guys, dey come from Levi, Abrahamʼs great-grankid. Godʼs Rules say dat dose priest guys get right fo take ten percent from all da stuffs all da odda Jewish peopo get -- dass from dea own Jewish bruddas an sistas, cuz dey all come from Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But Melkizedek, he one priest, no matta he neva have Levi fo his ancesta guy. But still yet, Melkizedek wen get ten percent from all da stuffs Abraham wen bring back. Now Abraham, he da guy dat God wen make promises to, but still yet, Melkizedek wen tell him, “God goin do plenny good kine stuffs fo you.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now, wen get somebody talk lidat, everybody know he gotta be da mo importan guy dass telling dat kine ting to da guy dass not so importan.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Da regula kine priest guys take da ten percent. Dose guys, dey goin mahke bumbye. But Melkizedek, he wen take da ten percent, an da Bible neva tell dat he wen mahke.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You can figga lidis: all da Jewish priest guys get da guy Levi fo dea ancesta guy, an dey take da ten percent from da peopo. But da time Melkizedek wen meet Abraham an Abraham wen pay da ten percent to Melkizedek, dass almos jalike Abraham wen pay um fo all da Levi peopo an all da Levi priest guys dat neva born yet, same time, cuz Abraham da ancesta fo all dem.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now, da priest guys, dey all wen come from Levi, an Aaron was dea first Head Priest. Da peopo need priest guys fo help da peopo fo do wat da Rules say. But da peopo no can come perfeck jus cuz dey get da Levi kine priest guys. Dass how come dey need one diffren kine priest guy. Dey need da Melkizedek kine, not da Aaron kine</verse>
				<verse number="9">An you know, wen dey change da kine priest dey get fo one nodda kine priest, same time dey gotta change da Rules.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now Jesus, he da guy we talking bout. He neva come from da Levi ohana, you know. He come from da Judah ohana, an da Rules neva say dat da guys from dat ohana get da right fo make sacrifice on top da altar.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Our Boss Jesus, everybody know dat he come from da Judah ohana. But wen Moses talk bout da guys from da Judah ohana, he neva say notting bout prieses. Anodda Priest, Da Melkizedek Kine</verse>
				<verse number="12">But da whole ting stay come even mo clear now: Get one nodda kine priest guy wen come. Him, he da Melkizedek kine priest, not da Aaron kine priest. (I talking bout Jesus, you know.)</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now da Rules say dat da priest guys gotta come from da Aaron ohana, an Jesus no come from dat ohana. Jesus, he stay one priest guy cuz he get da power fo live to da max foeva, an no mo notting can wipe him out.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Da Bible wen say dis bout him befo time: “You goin stay one priest foeva, Jalike Melkizedek.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Dat mean, da Rules from befo time no mo power fo help da peopo. Dass why God wen throw out da old rules.</verse>
				<verse number="16">An you know, da Rules neva make nobody come perfeck. Now, God give us someting mo betta. So den, now we stay shua we goin trus him. An cuz a dat we stay tight wit him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Wen da guys from Aaronʼs ohana wen come prieses befo time, God neva make promise notting. But wen God wen give us one mo betta ting, he wen make one strong promise.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Was wen Jesus wen come priest, dat God wen make dat strong promise. God wen tell him, “I da Boss. I make dis promise, An I no goin change my mind. ‘You one priest guy foeva.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="19">An cuz God wen make one strong promise to Jesus lidat, garans Jesus da One dat goin make shua us guys goin get one mo betta deal.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Befo time had plenny guys dat wen come priest. Dass cuz dey no can stay priest long time. Dey wen all mahke, dass why.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But Jesus, he da One dat stay live foeva, an he da kine priest dat stay foeva. Dass why no need one nodda priest guy.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Jesus, he no mahke. Everytime he stay dea fo aks God fo help fo da peopo dat come to God cuz a him. An dass how he get da power fo hemo dem good from all da bad tings dey stay in.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus, da right kine Head Priest guy fo us: He stay good an spesho fo God. Nobody can poin finga him notting. He stay clean inside. He stay diffren den all da peopo dat stay do da bad kine stuff. An God wen make him mo importan den everyting inside da world o inside da sky.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Dass why Jesus, he not jalike da odda head priest guys. He no need make sacrifice every day jalike dem. Dose guys, first dey gotta make sacrifice fo all da bad tings dey wen do, an den dey make sacrifice fo all da odda peopo. But Jesus, he wen make sacrifice fo da peopo one time ony, wen he wen make himself da sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now da Rules say fo make guys come da head priest. An you know, dey come head priest, no matta dey not strong inside. But awready had da Rules wen God wen make one strong promise fo make his Boy come da Head Priest. Az his Boy, da One dass perfeck foeva.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">So, all dis stuff I stay telling you guys, dis da main ting: Us guys get da kine Head Priest dass perfeck. Dass Jesus. He da One dat wen sit down in da mos importan place, by da right side a da throne wea God Da Awesome King stay up dea inside da sky.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Jesus stay working inside da place dat stay spesho fo God, da real place wea God stay, dat da Boss wen make, not jalike da kine tent da peopo wen make.</verse>
				<verse number="3">All da head priest guys, dey wen pick um fo come priest fo give da peopoʼs gifs to God, an fo kill da animals fo make da sacrifices. Az why Jesus, he gotta bring someting fo give to God too.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But you know, if Jesus was hea inside dis world now, he no can be one priest guy, cuz awready get guys dat give da gifs to God, jalike da Jewish Rules say.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Dose priest guys, dey work fo God inside one big tent dass ony jalike one copy a da real place dat stay wit God inside da sky. Dass why, wen Moses wen tink fo make da big tent, God wen tell him, “Make shua you do everyting jalike da picha I wen show you, wen you was on top da mountain.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">But da priest kine stuff dat Jesus stay doing fo God, dat stuff plenny mo betta den da stuff da odda priest guys stay do. An jalike dat, same ting, Jesus da middle man fo da deal dass plenny mo betta den da first deal. An dat new deal plenny mo betta, cuz God wen make mo betta promises wen he make dat new deal.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now, if no mo trouble wit da first deal, den no need make one nodda deal.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But God wen get plenny hard time wit da peopo, cuz dey no can handle. Dass why he wen say dis inside da Bible: “Da Boss say, ‘Listen! Da time goin come, Wen I goin make one new deal Fo da Israel ohana, An fo da Judah ohana.</verse>
				<verse number="9">No goin be same same jalike da deal Dat I wen make wit dea ancesta guys, Da time I wen take dea hand Fo bring um outa Egypt. Dem guys, dey neva stick wit da deal I wen make wit dem. Cuz a dat, I wen pau listen dem.’ Az wat da Boss wen say.</verse>
				<verse number="10">‘Dis da deal I goin make bumbye Wit da Israel ohana peopo. I goin put my Rules inside dea head. I goin write um inside dea heart. I goin be dea God fo real kine, An dey goin be my peopo fo real kine.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Den dey no need go teach all da guys dat live close, An dey no need go teach dea bruddas an sistas. No need tell um, “Eh! Gotta know da Boss!” Cuz dat time, dey goin all know me, Da small litto guys all da way to da big importan guys.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I goin pity dem an give um chance, No matta dey wen do tings dat no stay right. An I no goin stay tink bout Da bad kine stuff dey wen do.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Wen God wen say “da new deal,” dat mean he wen make da first deal no good awready. An you know, wateva stay coming old an no good, dat litto mo gone awready.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">So wat I telling you guys? Wen God wen make da first deal wit da Jewish peopo, he wen give dem da Rules how fo pray an show him love an respeck. An had one spesho place on top da earth wea dey suppose to do all dat.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Dat place was one big tent, an inside da first room da priest guys put da stand fo da lamps, an da table wit da Spesho Breads fo God on top. Dey call dat room “Da Spesho Place fo God.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Den had one big thick curtain inside, an da odda side dat curtain had one nodda room. Dey call dat room “Da Real, Real Spesho Place Fo God.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">An had one altar dea wit gold all ova fo burn incense. An had da Box Fo Help Da Peopo Rememba Da Deal Dey Get Wit God. Had gold all ova. Inside da Box had one gold pot wit da manna kine food inside. An had Aaronʼs walking stick dat one time wen grow leaf on top. Plus, had da flat kine stones wea God wen write down da first deal he wen make.</verse>
				<verse number="5">On top da Box, had two statue dat look jalike angel kine guys wit dea wings spread ova da Box. Dey stay dea fo show how awesome God stay. An dey stay ova da spesho place wea God hemo da shame fo da bad kine stuff da peopo wen do. But we no can talk some mo bout all dat kine stuff right now, you know.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Afta dey wen put everyting inside da big tent lidat, da priest guys wen go all da time inside da first room, fo do da tings dey suppose to do dea, cuz dass dea job.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But ony da head priest guy can go inside da Real, Real Spesho Room, an he can do dat ony one time every year. Wen he go inside dea, everytime he gotta take blood from one animal dey wen kill fo sacrifice. He give da blood from da sacrifice to God -- fo himself first, an den fo da bad kine stuff da peopo wen do, wen dey donno dey doing bad kine stuff.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Godʼs Spesho Spirit wen give us all dose tings fo show dat all da time da first tent stay, no way we can go inside da place wea God stay fo real kine.</verse>
				<verse number="9">All dat stuff jalike one picha fo teach us guys nowdays. Dat stuff show dat da gifs an animal sacrifices da priest guys give God fo da peopo, all dat kine stuff no mo power fo throw out da shame dat da peopo get inside, da peopo dat like pray to God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Dat stuff dey doing, dass ony bout how da peopo can o no can eat an drink stuffs, an all da kine ways dey suppose to wash diffren kine tings. But you know, dass ony rules bout da outside kine stuff dey suppose to do till God make everyting come new. Christ Wen Go Bleed An Mahke Fo Us</verse>
				<verse number="11">But Christ wen come awready, fo be da Head Priest. He da One dat make good kine stuff come to us guys awready. Jalike da priest guys befo time wen do dea work fo God inside one spesho tent, Christ do his work fo God inside one spesho place dass mo importan an mo betta den da odda one. Dat mo betta place, da peopo neva make um, an dat place no come from dis world.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Wen Christ wen go inside da Spesho Place fo God, he wen go inside one time ony. He get da right fo go inside dea, cuz was his own blood he wen bring in front God. He neva need da blood from da goats an cows dat dey wen sacrifice, fo go inside. An dass how he wen cut us guys loose foeva from da power dat da bad kine stuff get ova us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Befo time, da head priest guy wen take da blood from da goats an da cows, an da ash from one burn up young cow, an wen sprinkle um on top da peopo dat stay pilau an no can pray wit da odda peopo. Den dose peopo wen come spesho fo God, jalike dey clean so dey can pray wit da odda peopo.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Kay den, Godʼs Spesho Spirit dat stay foeva wen help Christ go bleed an mahke fo us. Christ wen give himself to God fo mahke, jalike one priest give God one perfeck animal fo sacrifice dat no mo notting wrong wit um. So den, da kine sacrifice Christ wen make, get plenny mo power fo throw out da shame dat we get inside, so we no goin stay doing da bad kine stuff dat cut us off from God. An den we goin work fo God, da One dat stay alive fo real kine.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Dass wat Christ wen do. An dass why Christ stay da middle man fo da new deal God make wit da peopo. So now, da peopo God wen tell fo come be his guys, dey goin get everyting dat he wen promise fo give his kids foeva. Dass cuz Christ wen go mahke fo cut dem loose from da power dat da bad kine stuff get ova dem, all da time dey was unda da first deal.</verse>
				<verse number="16">You know, wen get one will, dass one kine deal. Gotta show proof dat da guy dat wen make da will wen mahke fo real kine.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If da guy dat wen make da will stay alive still yet, dat will stay worth notting. Ony worth plenny afta da guy mahke.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Same ting, az why da first deal God wen make befo time, dat deal wen need blood from one animal sacrifice fo make da deal good.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Dat time, Moses wen tell all da peopo everyting dat God wen tell dem dey gotta do. Den he make sacrifice from cows an goats, an take da blood wit water, an dark red wool string fo tie togedda oregano branches, an wen sprinkle da blood on top da Book dat tell wat God wen say, an on top all da peopo dea.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Moses tell da peopo, “Dis da blood from da sacrifice, fo make solid da new deal dat God making wit you guys now. Dat mean, dat you guys gotta do wat he tell you.”</verse>

				<verse number="25">Eh, you guys! Make shua you guys listen God, da One dass talking. Da Israel peopo, dey neva like listen Moses. He da guy hea inside da world dat wen tell dem wat God wen say. But cuz dey neva listen, God wen punish dem. Dat mean, even mo us guys, we goin get it, if we no listen da One from da sky wen he talking to us!</verse>
				<verse number="26">Dat time was Godʼs voice dat wen make da earth shake. But now, he wen make promise. He say, “One mo time I goin make da earth shake, an I goin make da sky shake too.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Wen God say, “One mo time,” he mean, da stuff God wen make befo time, he goin shake um, an den he goin take um away. Den da stuff dat no shake, ony dat stuff goin stay foeva. (Da Rules Second Time 4:23; 9:3; Isaiah 33:14)</verse>
				<verse number="28">So den, God goin give us guys da right fo come jalike kings wit him. An nobody eva goin take away dat right from us guys. So, we gotta tell God “Mahalo plenny.” Wen we do dat, we show him all kine love an respeck, cuz we know how plenny awesome he stay.</verse>
