			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">When God created the heavens and the earth,</verse>
				<verse number="2">the earth was completely formless and empty, with nothing but darkness draped over the deep. God’s Spirit hovered over the face of the waters.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And then God announced, “Let there be light,” and light burst forth!</verse>
				<verse number="4">And God saw the light as pleasing and beautiful; he used the light to dispel the darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="5">God called the light “Day,” and the darkness “Night.” And so, evening gave way to morning—the first day.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And God said, “Let there be a dome between the waters to separate the water above from the water below.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">He made the dome and called it “Sky,” and separated the water above the dome from the water below the dome. Evening gave way to morning—day two.</verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">And God said, “Let the water beneath the sky be gathered into one place, and let the dry ground appear.” And so it happened.</verse>
				<verse number="10">God called the dry ground “Land,” and the gathered waters he called “Seas.” And God saw the beauty of his creation, and he was very pleased.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then God said, “Let the land burst forth with growth: plants that bear seeds of their own kind, and every variety of fruit tree, each with power to multiply from its own seed.” And so it happened.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The land flourished with grasses, every variety of seed-bearing plant, and trees bearing fruit with their seeds in them. And God loved what he saw, for it was beautiful.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Evening gave way to morning—day three.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And God said, “Let there be bright lights to shine in space to bathe the earth with their light. Let them serve as signs to separate the day from night, and signify the days, seasons, and years.” And so it happened.</verse>
				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16">God made two great lights: the brighter light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. He also spread the tapestry of shining stars</verse>
				<verse number="17">and set them all in the sky to illuminate the earth,</verse>
				<verse number="18">to rule over the day and to rule over the night, and to separate the light from darkness. God loved what he saw, for it was beautiful.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Evening gave way to morning—day four.</verse>
				<verse number="20">God said, “ Let there be life! Let the waters swarm with sea life, and let the sky be filled with soaring birds of every kind.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">God created huge sea creatures and every living creature that moves of every kind—swarming in the water and flying in the sky, according to their species. God loved what he saw, for it was beautiful.</verse>
				<verse number="22">God blessed them, saying, “Reproduce and be fruitful! Fill the waters of the sea with life, and the earth with flying birds!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Evening gave way to morning—day five.</verse>
				<verse number="24">God said, “Let the earth produce every class and kind of living creature: livestock, crawling things, wild animals, each after its kind.” And so it happened.</verse>
				<verse number="25">God made the wild animals according to their species, livestock according to their species, and all the creatures that creep along the ground according to their species. And God loved what he saw, for it was beautiful.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then God said, “Let us make a man and a woman in our image to be like us. Let them reign over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the livestock, over the creatures that creep along the ground, and over the wild animals.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">So God created man and woman and shaped them with his image inside them. In his own beautiful image, he created his masterpiece. Yes, male and female he created them.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And God blessed them in his love, saying, “Reproduce and be fruitful! Populate the earth and subdue it! Reign over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and every creature that lives on earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">And God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant growing throughout the earth, vegetables, and every fruit-bearing tree with its seed within itself. They will be your food.</verse>
				<verse number="30">They will also be food for every animal and bird, and every creature that moves on the ground—every creature with the breath of life.” And so it happened.</verse>
				<verse number="31">God surveyed all he had made and said, “I love it!” For it pleased him greatly. Evening gave way to morning—day six.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">And so the creation of the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.</verse>
				<verse number="2">By the seventh day, God had completed creating his masterpiece, so on the seventh day, he rested from all his work.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So God blessed the seventh day and made it sacred, because on it, he paused to rest from all his work of creation.</verse>
				<verse number="4">This is the account of the heavens and the earth after they were created. At the time Yahweh -God created earth and heaven,</verse>
				<verse number="5">there was yet no vegetation, grains of the field, or shrubs sprouting on the earth, for there was no one to cultivate the land, and Yahweh -God had not yet sent rain.</verse>
				<verse number="6">In those days a mist arose from the soil and watered the whole face of the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yahweh -God scooped up a lump of soil, sculpted a man, and blew into his nostrils the breath of life. The man came alive—a living soul!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then Yahweh -God planted a lush garden paradise in the East, in the Land of Delight, and there he placed the man he had formed.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh -God made all kinds of beautiful trees to grow there—fruitful trees to satisfy the taste. In the middle of the garden, he planted the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Flowing from the Land of Delight was a river to water the garden, and from there, it divided into four branches.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The first river, Overflowing Increase, encircles the gold-laden land of Havilah.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The gold of that land is pure, with many pearls and onyx found there.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The second river, Gushing, flows through the entire land of Cush.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The third river, Swift Flowing, flows east of Assyria. And the fourth is the river Fruitfulness.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh -God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to work and watch over it.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And Yahweh -God commanded him, “You may freely eat of every fruit of the garden.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But you must not eat of the Tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will most certainly die.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Yahweh -God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. Therefore, I will fashion a suitable partner to be his help and strength.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">For Yahweh -God had formed from the soil every animal of the field and every bird of the air and brought them before the man to see what he would call them. So, whatever the man called the living creature, that was its name.</verse>
				<verse number="20">He gave names to all the various cattle, birds, and wild animals, but Adam could not find a fitting companion that corresponded to him.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So Yahweh -God caused Adam to fall into a deep trance, and while he slept, he took a portion of Adam’s side and closed its place with flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then Yahweh -God used the portion of Adam’s side and skillfully crafted a woman and presented her to him.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then Adam said: “At last! One like me! Her bones were formed from my bones, and her flesh from my flesh! This one will be called ‘Woman,’ for she was taken from man.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">For this reason, a man leaves his father and his mother to be unselfishly attached to his wife. They become one flesh as a new family!</verse>
				<verse number="25">The man and his wife felt no shame, unaware that they were both naked.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Now the snake was the most cunning of all living beings that Yahweh -God had made. He deviously asked the woman, “Did God really tell you, ‘You must not eat fruit from any tree of the garden—?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="2">But the woman interrupted, “—We may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden,</verse>
				<verse number="3">except the tree in the center of the garden. God told us, ‘Don’t eat its fruit, or even touch it, or you’ll die.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="4">But the snake said to her, “You certainly won’t die.</verse>
				<verse number="5">God knows that the moment you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing both good and evil.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">When the woman saw that the tree produced delicious fruit, delightful to look upon, and desirable to give one insight, she took its fruit and ate it. She gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he also ate it.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Immediately, their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked, vulnerable, and ashamed; so they sewed fig leaves together for coverings.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then Adam and his wife heard the sound of Yahweh -God passing through the garden in the breeze of the day. So, they hid among the trees concealing themselves from the face of Yahweh -God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Yahweh -God called Adam’s name and asked, “Where are you?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Adam answered, “I heard your powerful presence moving in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Who told you that you were naked?” God said. “Did you eat the fruit of the tree that I commanded you not to eat?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Adam pointed to the woman and said, “The woman you placed alongside me— she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So Yahweh -God said to the woman, “What have you done?” The woman pointed to the snake and said, “The shining snake tricked me, and I ate.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yahweh -God then said to the snake, “Because you have done this, you are cursed above every wild animal, condemned above every creature of the field! You will slither on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life!</verse>
				<verse number="15">And I will place great hostility between you and the woman, and between her seed and yours. He will crush your head as you crush his heel.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then God said to the woman, “I will cause your labor pains in childbirth to be intensified; with pain you will give birth to children. You will desire to dominate your husband, but he will want to dominate you.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">And to Adam he said, “Because you obeyed your wife instead of me, and you ate from the forbidden tree when I had commanded you not to, the ground will be cursed because of you. You will eat of it through painful toil all the days of your life.</verse>
				<verse number="18">It will sprout weeds and thorns, and you will eat the plants of the field.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You will painfully toil and sweat to produce food to eat, until your body—taken from the ground—returns to the ground. For you are from dust, and to dust you will return.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">The man named his wife Eve— “Life-Giver,” because she would become the mother of every human being.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yahweh -God made garments from animal skins to clothe Adam and Eve.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And Yahweh -God said, “The man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. And now he might take in his hands fruit from the Tree of Life, and eat it, and live forever.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Therefore, Yahweh -God expelled him from Eden’s paradise to till the ground from which he was taken.</verse>
				<verse number="24">He drove them out of the garden, and placed fearsome angelic sentries east of the garden of Eden, with a turning fiery sword to guard the way to the Tree of Life.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Now Adam had slept with his wife, and she conceived and bore a son named Cain. She said, “By the grace of Yahweh I have birthed a man!”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then later, she gave birth to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel grew up to be a shepherd, and Cain became a farmer, working the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="3">After some time passed, Cain presented an offering to Yahweh from the produce of the land.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Abel also brought his offering, from among the finest of the firstborn of his flocks. Yahweh was very pleased with Abel and accepted his offering,</verse>
				<verse number="5">but with Cain and his offering, Yahweh was not pleased, making Cain very furious and resentful.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you so angry and bothered?</verse>
				<verse number="7">If you offer what is right, won’t you be accepted? But if you refuse to offer what is right, sin, the predator, is crouching in wait outside the door of your heart. It desires to have you, yet you must be its master.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">One day Cain said to his brother, “Let’s go out into the field.” When they arrived at the field, Cain rose and attacked and killed his brother Abel.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” He answered, “How do I know? Am I my brother’s keeper?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yahweh said, “Listen—the voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground! What have you done?</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now you are banished from the land, from the very ground that drank your brother’s blood from your hand!</verse>
				<verse number="12">When you try to cultivate the ground it will no longer produce crops for you; and you will be a fugitive, a homeless wanderer!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is more than I can bear!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Look—you’ve thrown me off the land today, and now I must hide from your presence. As a fugitive and wanderer on the earth, anyone who meets me may choose to kill me!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh responded, “Not so! If anyone kills you, I promise the seven-fold vengeance of Cain will be released upon him!” So, Yahweh put an identifying sign on Cain as a warning so that no one would dare kill him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then Cain left the presence of Yahweh and journeyed to the Land of Wandering, east of Eden.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Cain slept with his wife and she conceived and bore Enoch. Cain was building a city at the time, so he named it the Village of Enoch, after his son.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Enoch’s son was Irad, and Irad’s son was Mehujael, and Mehujael’s son was Methushael, and Methushael’s son was Lamech.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Lamech married two women, Dawn and Dusk.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Dawn gave birth to Jabal, the first of those who lived in tents and raised livestock.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jabal’s brother was Jubal, the first of musicians who played instruments.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Dusk gave birth to Tubalcain, the first of blacksmiths who forged all kinds of bronze and iron tools. His sister was Naamah.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Lamech boasted to his wives: “Listen to me, Dawn and Dusk! Mark my words, O wives of Lamech! I have killed a man for wounding me, and a young man for bruising me.</verse>
				<verse number="24">If killing Cain costs seven lives, for Lamech, it will cost seventy-seven!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Adam slept with his wife again and she bore a son whom she named Seth, meaning “appointed,” for she declared, “God has appointed for me another son to replace Abel, because Cain killed him.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">After many years Seth had a son named Enosh. During his lifetime, people began to worship Yahweh and pray to him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">When God created human beings he made them in the likeness of God and created them as male and female. After he had created them, he lovingly blessed them and named them “humanity.” So here is the family history of Adam and Eve:</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">When Adam was one hundred and thirty, he fathered a child in his own likeness and in his own image, and he named him Seth.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Adam lived an additional eight hundred years after Seth was born and had many other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The life span of Adam was nine hundred and thirty years, and then he died.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When Seth was one hundred and five, he fathered Enosh.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Seth lived an additional eight hundred and seven years after Enosh was born and had many other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The life span of Seth was nine hundred and twelve years, and then he died.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When Enosh was ninety, he fathered Kenan.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Enosh lived an additional eight hundred and fifteen years after Kenan was born and had many other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The life span of Enosh was nine hundred and five years, and then he died.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When Kenan was seventy, he fathered Mahalalel.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Kenan lived an additional eight hundred and forty years after Mahalalel was born and had many other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The life span of Kenan was nine hundred and ten years, and then he died.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When Mahalalel was sixty-five, he fathered Jared.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Mahalalel lived an additional eight hundred and thirty years after Jared was born and had many other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The life span of Mahalalel was eight hundred and ninety-five years, and then he died.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When Jared was one hundred and sixty-two, he fathered Enoch.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jared lived an additional eight hundred years after Enoch was born and had many other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The life span of Jared was nine hundred and sixty-two years, and then he died.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When Enoch was sixty-five, he fathered Methuselah.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Enoch walked with God for three hundred years after Methuselah was born and had many other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Enoch and God walked together as intimate friends; then God took him to himself, and he was seen no more. The life span of Enoch was three hundred and sixty-five years.</verse>
				<verse number="24"></verse>
				<verse number="25">When Methuselah was one hundred and eighty-seven, he fathered Lamech.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Methuselah lived an additional seven hundred and eighty-two years after Lamech was born and had many other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The life span of Methuselah was nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and then he died.</verse>
				<verse number="28">When Lamech was one hundred and eighty-two, he fathered a son</verse>
				<verse number="29">and named him Noah, saying, “He will relieve us from our hard work and painful toil, and from the ground that Yahweh cursed.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Lamech lived an additional five hundred and ninety-five years after Noah was born and had many other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The life span of Lamech was seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and then he died.</verse>
				<verse number="32">After Noah had lived five hundred years, he fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">When people began to populate the earth, they had many lovely daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Divine beings found them very appealing, so they took the women they wanted as their wives.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh said, “My Spirit will not strive with humanity indefinitely, for they are mortal. Their life span will be shortened to only one hundred and twenty years.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Back then, and later, there were giants on the earth, who were born as a result of the unholy union of heavenly beings with the human daughters. They were the mighty ones of old, warriors of renown.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But Yahweh saw how extremely wicked humanity had become, for they imagined only evil, for all they thought about was doing evil all the time.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And Yahweh was saddened that he had made humanity, and his heart was filled with pain.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So Yahweh decided, “I will do away with my ruined creation —human beings that I created—people and animals, creeping things and flying birds, for it breaks my heart that I made them!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But one man discovered grace before the face of Yahweh: Noah.</verse>
				<verse number="9">This is the story of Noah. Noah was a godly man of integrity, without fault in his generation, and he lived close to God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Injustice and violence filled the world; the earth was ruined in the sight of God,</verse>
				<verse number="12">for he saw how debased the world had become, for everyone was corrupt to the core.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So God said to Noah, “I have decided that all living creatures must die, for their violence has filled the earth, and I will wipe them off the face of the earth!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Build a boat for yourself—an ark of sturdy timber. And this is how you are to design it: make separate compartments within it, and seal it inside and out with thick tar. The length is to be 450 feet, its width 75 feet, and its height 45 feet.</verse>
				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16">Cover it with a roof, but leave a gap of eighteen inches at the top for ventilation. Construct a door on the side of the ark, and design it with lower, middle, and upper decks.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I am going to release a great flood that will destroy all life upon the earth, and every breathing thing under heaven will perish—everything on earth will die.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But as for you, I will establish my covenant of friendship, and you will escape destruction by coming into the ark, you and your wife, your sons and their wives.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Bring with you into the ark a pair of every animal, male and female; and they will also be spared.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Different kinds of birds, animals large and small —two of every kind I will send to you to be kept alive.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Also take with you every kind of food, both for you and them.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">So Noah completed all these preparations and did everything exactly as God had commanded him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">The day came when Yahweh said to Noah, “Come into the ark, you and your entire household, for I have found you to be the only one righteous in my eyes in this generation.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Take with you seven pairs of all the clean animals, both male and female, and one pair of all the unclean animals, both male and female.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Take seven pairs of flying birds of all kinds, male and female, to make sure they survive on the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For in seven days I will send rain and flood the earth for forty days and forty nights. Every living thing that I made I will wipe off the face of the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Noah obeyed all that Yahweh had commanded him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Noah was six hundred years old when the great flood came on the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Noah and his wife and his sons and their wives boarded the ark to escape the flood.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Two of each animal, the male and female, clean and unclean, large and small, along with birds and crawling things, entered the ark with Noah as God had commanded.</verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10">Then seven days later, massive floodwaters covered the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">It started in the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month on the seventeenth day. On that day, all the fountains of the subterranean deep cracked open and burst up through the ground. Heaven’s floodgates were opened,</verse>
				<verse number="12">and heavy rains fell on the earth for forty days and forty nights.</verse>
				<verse number="13">On that very day, Noah and his wife, their sons, Ham, Shem, and Japheth, and their wives, entered safely into the ark.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Pairs of every species of animal entered with them—wild animals, domesticated animals, large and small, and every species of bird and winged creatures—every animal that has the breath of life came into the ark with Noah.</verse>
				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16">Both male and female went inside as God had commanded Noah; and Yahweh himself shut them in.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For forty days, the flood engulfed the earth. The swelling floodwaters lifted up the ark until it rose high above the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The raging flood completely inundated the earth, but the ark floated safely, drifting upon the surface of the water,</verse>
				<verse number="19">until the highest mountains were completely submerged beneath the rising waters.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The waters rose over twenty-two feet above the highest mountains.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Every living thing on the earth perished—domesticated animals, wild animals, birds, everything that moved on the earth, and all mankind perished.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Everything perished—every animal on earth with the breath of life in its nostrils died.</verse>
				<verse number="23">All life on earth was blotted out—all that he had made, animals large and small, wild and domesticated, birds and reptiles, including humanity, was wiped off the face of the earth. Only Noah was left behind, and those who were in the ark with him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">And the waters covered the earth for 150 days.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">God’s heart was moved with compassion as he remembered Noah and all the animals, large and small, that were with him in the ark. And God caused a wind to sweep across the earth again and the waters subsided.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He closed the subterranean fountains and the floodgates of heaven and held back the rain.</verse>
				<verse number="3">After 150 days, the floodwaters gradually receded from the earth and the waters began to subside.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on the highest peak in Ararat.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The waters continued to recede until the tenth month. And on the first day of the tenth month, all the mountaintops appeared.</verse>
				<verse number="6">After forty more days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark</verse>
				<verse number="7">and released a raven. It flew back and forth from the ark until the earth was dry.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then he sent out a dove to see if the waters had receded from the surface of the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But the dove found no place to rest, so it returned to Noah in the ark because the waters still covered the face of the earth. Noah put out his hand and grasped the dove and put it back into the ark.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He waited another seven days and released the dove from the ark again.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Before evening, the dove came back to him—and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! So Noah realized that the waters had finally subsided from the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then he waited another seven days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him in the ark.</verse>
				<verse number="13">In Noah’s six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah lifted the hatch, looked out, and saw the dry ground.</verse>
				<verse number="14">On the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was dry.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then God said to Noah,</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Come out of the ark, you and your wife, your sons, and their wives.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Release all the animals with you and set them free—birds, animals large and small—every living thing. And they will multiply and abound and flourish on the earth and in the sky.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">So Noah and his family left the ark;</verse>
				<verse number="19">and every animal large and small, every bird and crawling thing came out of the ark by families.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Noah erected an altar dedicated to Yahweh. Then he selected ritually clean animals and birds of every species and offered them as burnt sacrifices on the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And when Yahweh smelled the sweet fragrance of Noah’s offerings, his heart was stirred, and he said, “Never again will I curse the earth because of people, even though the imagination of their hearts are evil from their childhood; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done. I promise this:</verse>
				<verse number="22">“As long as earth exists there will always be seasons of planting and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">God lovingly blessed Noah and all his family and said to them, “Reproduce, be fruitful, and populate the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I will cause every living creature of earth, sky, and sea to fear and dread you from this time forward. They are now under your authority.</verse>
				<verse number="3">You may now eat the meat of animals as well as green plants; I now give you everything for food for you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">However, you must not eat meat with its lifeblood still in it, for its life is in the blood.</verse>
				<verse number="5">If anyone takes another person’s life, I will demand an account—whether from man or beast, I will demand an account for taking a human life.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Whoever sheds human blood, by other humans he must have his own blood shed; for to kill a person is to kill one made in God’s own beautiful image.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now all of you, with my blessing, reproduce, be fruitful and repopulate the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then God said to Noah and his family,</verse>
				<verse number="9">“I establish my loving covenant with you, your descendants,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and every living creature that is with you—animals large and small, birds, and every living thing that came out of the ark.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I will maintain my loving covenant with you. I will never again completely destroy life on earth by means of a flood. Yes, never again will a flood destroy the whole earth!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Here is the sign for you and future generations that my loving covenant will endure between me and you and every animal that came with you out of the ark:</verse>
				<verse number="13">I have placed my rainbow among the clouds, and it will be a sign of my loving covenant between me and the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Whenever I bring clouds over the earth, and the rainbow appears in the clouds,</verse>
				<verse number="15">I will remember my covenant with you and with every living thing upon the earth. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy life from the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When the rainbow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant I made with you and every living thing of every kind upon the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">So God said to Noah, “The rainbow is my signature in the sky, my seal of love to confirm that I have kept my covenant between me and every living thing on earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Noah’s sons came out of the ark with him: Shem, Ham (the father of Canaan), and Japheth.</verse>
				<verse number="19">From these three sons of Noah the entire world was repopulated.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Noah, a farmer, was the first to plant a vineyard.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He drank so much of the wine he made that he got drunk and passed out naked inside his tent.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And Ham, the father of Canaan, went into the tent and gazed on his shamefully exposed father. Then he went out and informed his brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So, Shem and Japheth took their father’s cloak and walked backwards with the cloak on their shoulders into the tent to cover up their naked father. Respectfully, they turned their faces away so as not to see their father lying there exposed.</verse>
				<verse number="24">When Noah sobered up and realized what his youngest son had done to him,</verse>
				<verse number="25">he uttered these words: “Cursed be your son, Canaan, and let him be the lowest of servants to his brothers.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">He also said, “Worthy of praise is Yahweh, the God of Shem! Let Canaan be Shem’s slave.</verse>
				<verse number="27">May God enlarge Japheth’s family and increase his territory. May he share in the blessing of Shem, and his descendants make their homes among the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his slave also!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">After the flood, Noah lived another three hundred and fifty years.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Noah’s entire lifetime was nine hundred and fifty years, and then he died.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">This is the story of the descendants of Noah’s three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. After the great flood, they fathered many children.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Cyprus, and Rhodes.</verse>
				<verse number="5">All of Japheth’s descendants lived in their respective tribes and regions, each group speaking its own language. From there, the people spread to distant shores and faraway lands.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The sons of Ham were Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya, and Canaan.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Cush also had a son named Nimrod, who became known as the first mighty conqueror.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He was a mighty despot before Yahweh. There was a saying, “Like Nimrod, a mighty despot before Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">The centers of his kingdom, Babel, Erech, and Akkad, were in the land of Shinar.</verse>
				<verse number="11">From there, he went into Assyria and built the cities of Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,</verse>
				<verse number="12">and Resen (which is between the great city of Calah and Nineveh).</verse>
				<verse number="13">Egypt was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,</verse>
				<verse number="14">Pathrusites, Casluhites, and Caphtorites (the ancestors of the Philistines).</verse>
				<verse number="15">Canaan was the father of Sidon (his firstborn), the Hittites,</verse>
				<verse number="16">the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,</verse>
				<verse number="17">the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,</verse>
				<verse number="18">the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. The families of the Canaanites eventually scattered across</verse>
				<verse number="19">the Canaanite territory extending from Sidon toward Gerar to Gaza including Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.</verse>
				<verse number="20">These were the descendants of Ham by families, lands, languages, and nations.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Shem, the older brother of Japheth, also had sons and was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber, who were also known as “Hebrews.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">The sons of Shem were Elam, Assyria, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, the father of Eber.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Eber was the father of two sons: Peleg, (or “Division,” for during his lifetime the earth was divided), and his brother Joktan, the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,</verse>
				<verse number="26"></verse>
				<verse number="27">Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,</verse>
				<verse number="28">Obal, Abimael, Sheba,</verse>
				<verse number="29">Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All the descendants of Joktan</verse>
				<verse number="30">lived in the territory that extends all the way from Mesha toward the eastern hills of Sephar.</verse>
				<verse number="31">These were the families of Shem according to their genealogies, by their families, lands, languages, and nations.</verse>
				<verse number="32">After the flood, Noah’s descendants formed nations as the people spread throughout the earth.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Now everyone at that time spoke a single language with one vocabulary.</verse>
				<verse number="2">As people migrated eastward, they found a large plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They said to one another, “Come, let’s unite together and make bricks of clay and burn them until they become hard.” So, they piled up the bricks they made to serve as stones and collected tar for mortar.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then they said, “Come, let’s begin work to build ourselves a city with a lofty tower that rises into the heavens. We’ll make a name for ourselves, a monument to us, instead of being scattered all over the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But when Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower which mortals had started building,</verse>
				<verse number="6">he said, “If they have begun this as one people sharing a common language, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Come, let us go down and confuse their language and prevent them from understanding each other.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">So Yahweh scattered them over the entire earth, and they stopped building their city.</verse>
				<verse number="9">That is why the city was called Babel—because it was there that Yahweh confused the language of the whole world and from there the people were scattered over the face of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="10">These are the descendants of Shem. Two years after the flood, at the age of one hundred, Shem had a son named Arphaxad.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And after Arphaxad was born, Shem lived another five hundred years and had other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When Arphaxad was thirty-five, he had a son named Shelah.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And after Shelah was born Arphaxad lived another four hundred and three years and had other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When Shelah was thirty, he had a son named Eber.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And after Eber was born, Shelah lived another four hundred and three years and had other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When Eber was thirty-four, he had a son named Peleg.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And after Peleg was born, Eber lived another four hundred and thirty years and had other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When Peleg was thirty, he had a son named Reu.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And after Reu was born, Peleg lived another two hundred and nine years and had other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When Reu was thirty-two, he had a son named Serug.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And after Serug was born, Reu lived another two hundred and seven years and had other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="22">When Serug was thirty, he had a son named Nahor.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And after Nahor was born, Serug lived another two hundred years and had other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="24">When Nahor was twenty-nine, he had a son named Terah.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And after Terah was born, Nahor lived another one hundred and nineteen years and had other sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="26">When Terah was seventy, he had sons named Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Here are the descendants of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and Haran was the father of Lot.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Haran preceded his father, Terah, in death in the land of his birth, in the Chaldean city of Ur.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The brothers, Abram and Nahor, were both married. Abram’s wife was Sarai. Nahor married the daughter of his deceased brother Haran; her name was Milcah, and her sister was Iscah.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Now Sarai was barren and childless.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram’s wife, and they all departed together from the Chaldean city of Ur to go into the land of Canaan. But when they journeyed as far as Haran, they settled there.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Terah lived two hundred and five years and died in Haran.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Now Yahweh said to Abram, “Leave it all behind — your native land, your people, your father’s household, and go to the land that I will show you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Follow me, and I will make you into a great nation. I will exceedingly bless and prosper you, and I will make you famous, so that you will be a tremendous source of blessing for others.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I will bless all who bless you and curse all who curse you. And through you all the families of the earth will be blessed.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Abram obeyed Yahweh and left; and Lot went with him. Now Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran after his father died.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all the possessions and people he had acquired in Haran; and they departed for the land of Canaan. When they arrived in the land of Canaan,</verse>
				<verse number="6">Abram passed through the land and stopped at the sacred site of Shechem, famous for the great oak tree of Moreh. At that time, the Canaanites were also in the land.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then Yahweh appeared before Abram and said, “This is the land I will personally deliver to your seed.” So Abram erected an altar there to Yahweh, who had appeared before him.</verse>
				<verse number="8">From there, he journeyed on toward the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built another altar to Yahweh where he prayed and worshiped Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Abram journeyed from there by stages through the southern desert region.</verse>
				<verse number="10">At that time, a severe famine struck the land of Canaan, forcing Abram to travel down to Egypt and live there as a foreigner.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When he drew near to Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “Look, I’m worried because I know that you are a beautiful, gorgeous woman.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When the Egyptian men take one look at you, they will say, ‘She is his wife.’ Then they will kill me in order to have you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Just tell them you are my sister so that they will treat me well for your sake and spare my life.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">When Abram entered Egypt, everyone noticed Sarai’s stunning beauty.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When Pharaoh’s dignitaries spotted her, they went to Pharaoh and raved about her beauty. Then they took Sarai into the palace and made her part of Pharaoh’s harem.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Because she pleased Pharaoh, Abram got along very well in Egypt and received royal treatment: he was given sheep, cattle, male and female donkeys, camels, and male and female slaves.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But Yahweh struck Pharaoh and his household with terrible diseases because he had taken Abram’s wife, Sarai.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So Pharaoh sent for Abram and said, “How could you do this to me? Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife?</verse>
				<verse number="19">And why did you lie to me by saying, ‘She’s my sister,’ so that I took her as my wife? Now, here’s your wife back; take her and begone!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then Pharaoh gave strict orders to his men to escort them out of Egypt along with everything they had.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Abram took his wife and all that he owned, and left Egypt. They returned to the southern desert region, and Lot went with them.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now Abram had become very rich in livestock, silver, and gold.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And he journeyed on from place to place as far as the hill country region of Bethel. He returned to the place between Bethel and Ai where he had pitched his tent at the beginning.</verse>
				<verse number="4">This was the place he had first built an altar to pray and worship Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now Lot, who accompanied Abram, was also rich and had accumulated flocks, herds, family, and servants.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Arguments erupted between Abram’s herdsmen and Lot’s herdsmen because the land could not support both living together, for their animals and possessions were too numerous. At that time, Canaanites and Perizzites were also in the land.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">So Abram said to Lot, “Let’s not quarrel with each other, or between our herdsmen, since we are relatives.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Look at the vast land that is in front of you! Let’s settle in different regions. If you choose the land on the left, then I’ll go right, and if you want land on the right, then I’ll go left.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Lot lifted his eyes and carefully surveyed the land around him all the way to Zoar. He noticed that the Jordan Valley was fertile and well-watered (this was before Yahweh had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). It looked beautiful, like the garden of Yahweh, or like Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So Lot chose to settle in the Jordan Valley. He departed toward the east, and the family split up and separated from each other.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Abram settled in the land of Canaan while Lot settled in the cities of the lowlands, at a place near Sodom.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now, the people of Sodom were extremely wicked and rebelled against Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="14">After Lot separated from him, Yahweh spoke to Abram, “Lift up your eyes and look around you to the north, the south, the east, and the west.</verse>
				<verse number="15">As far as you can see in every direction is the land that I will give to you forever—to you and your seed.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I will multiply them until they are as numerous as the specks of dust on the earth. If anyone could count the dust of the earth, then your offspring could also be counted.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now, get up and walk through the land—its length and its breadth. All the land you walk upon will be my gift to you!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Abram moved his camp and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built another altar to Yahweh.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">During the reign of Amraphel king of Babylon, he allied with three other kings: Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim.</verse>
				<verse number="2">These four kings went to war against five kings: Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Kedorlaomer had oppressed these five kings for twelve years until they rebelled against him in the thirteenth year. They all became regional allies in the valley of Siddim, which is now the Dead Sea.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer went to war with his allied kings. They defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shavah-kiriathaim,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then they turned back and attacked En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh) and subdued all the country of the Amalekites and the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar), marched out in battle formation in the valley of Siddim.</verse>
				<verse number="9">There they faced off against Kedorlaomer, king of Elam; Tidal, king of Goyim; Amraphel, king of Babylon; and Arioch, king of Ellasar—four kings against five.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah and their armies retreated from the battle and fled, some of them fell into the tar pits, and the rest fled to the hill country.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The four victorious kings captured all the possessions and all the food of Sodom and Gomorrah and left.</verse>
				<verse number="12">They captured Lot, Abram’s nephew who had been living in Sodom, and took him and all his possessions.</verse>
				<verse number="13">One who escaped came to Abram the Hebrew and told him what had happened to Lot. Abram was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite. Mamre had two brothers, Eshcol and Aner, who were allied by treaty with Abram.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When Abram heard that his nephew Lot had been taken captive by the four kings, he mobilized all the men in his camp, 318 in all who had been born and trained in his own household, and he pursued the invaders as far north as Dan.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then, during the night, Abram strategically divided his forces and defeated them. His forces attacked them and routed them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He recovered all the stolen possessions and brought back his nephew Lot, together with the women and all the prisoners.</verse>
				<verse number="17">After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet Abram at the valley of the Shaveh (known as the King’s Valley).</verse>
				<verse number="18">And Melchizedek, who was both a priest of the Most High God and the king of Salem, brought out to Abram bread and wine.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He spoke over him a special blessing, saying, “Blessed is Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And blessed be God Most High, whose power delivered your enemies into your hands!” Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all he possessed.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Just give me the people you rescued; keep all the spoils for yourself.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I raised my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, and I pledged a solemn oath to the Possessor of heaven and earth</verse>
				<verse number="23">that I would keep nothing for myself that belongs to you, not even a thread of a garment or sandal strap. That way, you will never be able to say, ‘I was the one that made Abram rich.’</verse>
				<verse number="24">I will take nothing except what my young men have eaten, and the share of those who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their share.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Afterwards, the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision and said, “Abram, don’t yield to fear, for I am your Faithful Shield and your Abundant Reward.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">But Abram replied, “Lord Yahweh, what good is your reward if I remain childless? I’m about to die without a son, and my servant, Eliezer of Damascus, will inherit all my wealth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">A servant in my household will end up with everything because you have not given me any children.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Immediately, the word of Yahweh came to him: “ No! Eliezer will not be your heir. I will give you a son from your own body to be your heir.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Yahweh brought him outside his tent and said, “Gaze into the night sky. Go ahead and try to count the stars.” He continued, “Your seed will be as numerous as the stars!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">And Abram trusted every word Yahweh had spoken! And because of his faith, Yahweh credited it to him as righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then he said to him, “I am Yahweh, who brought you out of the Babylonian city of Ur, to give you all this land to possess.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But Abram said, “Lord Yahweh, how can I be sure that I can possess this land for myself?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a female goat, and a ram, each three years old, also a turtledove and a young pigeon.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So, Abram brought the animals to him and killed them. He cut them in two (except the birds) and laid each half opposite the other in two rows.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Vultures swooped down upon the carcasses, but Abram stood there and drove the vultures away.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As the heavy veil of night fell, Abram went into a deep state of sleep, and suddenly a great dreadful darkness surrounded him and he was filled with fear.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Yahweh said to Abram, “Know this: your descendants will live as strangers in a foreign country. They will be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Afterward I will punish that nation for enslaving them, and your descendants will come out of slavery with untold wealth.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and live a full life.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And after the fourth generation, your descendants will return here; for then the sin of the Amorites will be ripe for judgment.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">When the sun had set, and it was very dark, there suddenly appeared a smoking firepot and a blazing torch that passed between the split carcasses.</verse>
				<verse number="18">On that day, Yahweh entered into covenant with Abram: “I have given this land to your descendants, from the Egyptian border to the great river Euphrates,</verse>
				<verse number="19">the entire land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,</verse>
				<verse number="20">the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaites,</verse>
				<verse number="21">the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">Now Sarai had borne no children for Abram. She had an Egyptian slave girl named Hagar,</verse>
				<verse number="2">so Sarai said to Abram, “Please listen. Since Yahweh has kept me childless, go sleep with my maidservant. Perhaps through her I can build you a family.” Abram listened and did what Sarai asked.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Abram had already lived ten years in the land of Canaan when his wife Sarai took her Egyptian slave girl Hagar and gave her to Abram to be his second wife.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. Once Hagar realized she was pregnant, she belittled Sarai and despised her.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So Sarai went to Abram and said, “ It’s totally your fault that Hagar despises me—and you’re not standing up for me! I gave my slave girl to your embrace, and when she found out she was pregnant, she despised me. May Yahweh judge between us who is in the right!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Abram responded, “She’s your slave girl under your authority, so do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai cruelly mistreated Hagar, who then ran away from her.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The angel of Yahweh encountered Hagar by a spring in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He asked her, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and what are you doing here?” She replied, “I’m running away from Sarai, my mistress.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">The angel of Yahweh told her, “You have to go back to your mistress and humbly submit to her.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">The angel added, “I will greatly multiply your descendants until no one can count them.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh ’s angel continued, “You are now pregnant, and soon you will give birth to a son. You will name him Ishmael, for Yahweh has heard your cries of distress.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Your son will have a wild nature that no one can tame. He will be hostile toward everyone, and everyone will be hostile toward him; and he will live at odds with all his kinsmen.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">After her encounter with Yahweh, Hagar called him by a special name, “You are the God of My Seeing,” for she said, “Oh my, did I just see God and live to talk about it?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">That is why the well is called Spring of the Living One Who Watches Over Me. The well is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Hagar returned and bore Abram a son, whom Abram named Ishmael.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">When Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to him again and said, “I am the God who is more than enough. Live your life in my presence and be blameless.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I will confirm my covenant between me and you, and I will greatly multiply your descendants.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Abram fell on his face in awe before God, and God said to him,</verse>
				<verse number="4">“I establish my covenant with you: “You will become a father of many nations.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You will no longer be named Abram because I am changing your name to Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I will make you abundantly fruitful, more than you expect. I will make nations out of you, and kings will trace their lineage back to you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yes, I will establish my eternal covenant of love between me and you, and it will extend to your descendants throughout their generations. I will be your children’s God, just as I am your God.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I will give to you and your seed the land to which you have migrated. The entire land of Canaan will be yours and your descendants’ as an everlasting possession. And I will be their God forever!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">God explained to Abraham, “Your part of the covenant is to obey its terms, you and your descendants throughout the ages.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So here is the sign of the covenant that you are to keep, so that it will endure between you and me and your descendants: circumcise every male among you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You must undergo cutting off the flesh of your foreskin as a special sign of the covenant between me and you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Throughout your generations, each male child must be circumcised eight days after his birth. This includes those not of your descendants—those born in your household and foreign-born servants whom you have purchased;</verse>
				<verse number="13">they must be circumcised, homeborn and purchased alike. In this way, you will carry in your flesh the sign of my everlasting covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Any uncircumcised male who does not have the foreskin of his flesh cut off will be cut off from his people, for he has broken my covenant.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">God also said to Abraham: “Concerning your wife Sarai, you are not to call her Sarai anymore, but Sarah, ‘My Princess,’ will be her name.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I will wonderfully bless her, and I will certainly give you a son through her. Yes, I will bless her greatly, and she will become a mother of nations; kings of nations will arise among her children!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then Abraham laughed so hard he fell to the ground, saying to himself, “How in the world can a hundred-year-old man become a father? How can my wife Sarah get pregnant at ninety?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">And then he spoke out loud: “O, that Ishmael might prosper with your blessing!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">God said, “Listen to me. I promise that you and Sarah will have a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will confirm my everlasting covenant of love with him and his seed.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And regarding Ishmael, I have heard your cry and I will indeed bless him. I will cause him to have many, many descendants. He will father twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But my everlasting covenant relationship is with Isaac, who will be born to you and Sarah about this time next year.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God ascended up to heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So without delay Abraham obeyed God and took his son Ishmael and every male in his household (whether born in his house or foreign-born servants) and circumcised them that very same day.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Abraham was already ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,</verse>
				<verse number="25">and his son Ishmael was thirteen.</verse>
				<verse number="26">They were both circumcised on the same day,</verse>
				<verse number="27">along with all the men of his household (whether born in his house or foreign-born servants).</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh appeared once again to Abraham while he lived by the oak grove of Mamre. During the hottest part of the day, as Abraham sat at his tent door,</verse>
				<verse number="2">he looked up and suddenly saw three men standing nearby. As soon as he saw them, he ran from his tent to welcome them. He bowed down to the ground</verse>
				<verse number="3">and said, “My Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, don’t pass me by. Stay for a while with your servant.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I’ll have some water brought to you all so that you can wash your feet. Rest here a while under the tree.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Since you’ve stopped by your servant’s home and honored me with your presence, I’ll have food prepared for you so that you can be refreshed; then you can go on your way.” “Very well,” they responded, “go ahead and do as you have said.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Abraham hurried back into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick, we have guests! Get three measures of fine flour, knead it, and bake some bread.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then Abraham ran to the herd, selected a tender choice calf, and told his servant, “Hurry—prepare this calf for my guests!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then he brought the meal they had prepared—roasted meat, bread, curds, and milk—and set it before his guests. Abraham stood by them under the tree while they ate.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They asked him, “Where is your wife Sarah?” He answered, “Over there—in the tent.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then one spoke up and said, “I will return about this time next year, when your wife Sarah will certainly have a son.” Sarah overheard it, for she was at the tent door not far behind him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now, both Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Sarah laughed to herself with disbelief, saying, “A woman my age—have a baby? After I’m worn out will I now enjoy marital bliss and conceive —and with my aged husband?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh knew her thoughts and asked Abraham, “Why is Sarah laughing, saying, ‘How can a woman my age have a baby?’</verse>
				<verse number="14">Do you think there is anything too marvelous for Yahweh? I will appear to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Sarah was afraid, so she denied it, saying, “I wasn’t laughing.” But he said, “Yes, you were!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Afterward, the three men departed and walked toward Sodom, and Abraham went off with them to see them on their way.</verse>
				<verse number="17">As they walked, Yahweh said, “Should I really hide from Abraham what I intend to do?</verse>
				<verse number="18">After all, he will become a great and powerful nation, and every nation on earth will seek bliss like his.</verse>
				<verse number="19">It is true; I have singled him out as my own, so that he will lead his family and household to follow my ways and live by what is right and just. I will fulfill all the promises that I have spoken to him.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yahweh explained to Abraham, “The outcry for justice against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so blatant</verse>
				<verse number="21">that I must go down and see if their wicked actions are as great as the outrage that has come to me, and if not, then I will know.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">As Yahweh ’s two companions went on toward Sodom, Abraham remained there, as Yahweh paused before Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So Abraham came forward to present his case before Yahweh, and said, “Are you really going to sweep away the righteous while you judge the wicked?</verse>
				<verse number="24">What if you find fifty righteous people in Sodom? Isn’t your mercy great enough to forgive? Why judge the entire city at the cost of the fifty righteous who live there?</verse>
				<verse number="25">That’s not who you are—one who would slay the righteous with the wicked, treating them both the same way! Wouldn’t the Merciful Judge of all the earth always do what is right?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">And Yahweh said, “Alright. If I find fifty righteous in Sodom, I will spare the whole city for their sake.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Abraham spoke up again and said, “I am just a man formed from earth’s dust and ashes but allow me to be so bold as to ask you, my Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="28">What if there are only five lacking, and you only find forty-five righteous in Sodom? It’s not who you are to destroy the entire city for lack of five righteous people.” And Yahweh said, “Alright. If I find forty-five righteous in Sodom, I will spare the whole city.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">“But what if there are only forty?” Abraham asked further. Yahweh answered, “Alright. If I only find forty, I will spare the city.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Abraham paused —then he said, “Lord, please don’t be offended with me, and let me speak . . . What if there are only thirty?” Yahweh answered, “Alright. If I find only thirty, I will spare the city.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Abraham ventured even further, asking, “Allow me to dare speak this way to you, my Lord. But what if you find there only twenty righteous?” Yahweh answered, “Alright. For the sake of the twenty I will not destroy the city.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then Abraham took a deep breath and asked, “Once more, please don’t let my Lord be angry with me if I make but one more request. What if you find only ten righteous?” And Yahweh answered, “Alright. I will extend my mercy and not destroy the city for the sake of ten righteous.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Yahweh finished speaking with Abraham. He immediately went on his way, and Abraham returned home.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">That evening, the two angels came to Sodom while Lot was sitting at the city’s gateway. When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed with his face to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He said, “Please, my lords, come to your servant’s house to spend the night and wash your feet; then you can rise early and go on your way.” “No,” they answered. “We will be fine to spend the night in the town square.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">But Lot was so insistent they finally agreed to go to his house. Lot had unleavened bread baked for them and prepared a feast, and they ate.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But before they retired for the night, the men of the city, men young and old, from every part of the city of Sodom, to the last man, surrounded the house.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They shouted out to Lot, “Where are the men who came to your house tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Lot went outside, shutting the door behind him,</verse>
				<verse number="7">and said to them, “No! My brothers, I beg you, don’t sink to such depravity!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Look, I have two virgin daughters; I’ll bring them out to you, and you can do with them as you please. Only don’t do anything to these men, for they are guests in my house.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Get out of our way,” they replied. “This guy comes as a foreigner to live among us, and now he dares to judge us! We’ll inflict more harm on you than on them!” Just then they lunged at Lot and tried to break down the door,</verse>
				<verse number="10">but the two angels reached out and pulled Lot safely back into the house and bolted the door.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They struck the men outside the house, young and old, with one blazing flash of light so that they could not find the door!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then the visitors said to Lot, “Who else lives here? Do you have any other family here—sons or daughters, sons-in-law or daughters-in-law who live in Sodom? Get them all out of the city,</verse>
				<verse number="13">because we are about to destroy this place. A tremendous outcry against the people has come before Yahweh, and he has sent us here to destroy it!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">So Lot went out to find the two men who were pledged to marry his daughters and told them, “Hurry, leave the city, for Yahweh is about to destroy it!” But they thought he was only joking and paid him no attention.</verse>
				<verse number="15">At dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Go! Take your wife and your two daughters and leave or you will be consumed in the judgment about to come to the city!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But Lot hesitated, so the angels grabbed his hands and the hands of his wife and daughters and brought them outside the city, because Yahweh was merciful to them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Once they were safely outside the city, the angels said to them, “Run for your lives! Don’t stop anywhere in the plain until you’ve reached the mountains. And don’t even look back, or you’ll die!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Lot replied, “Oh no, my lords.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You’ve been so gracious to your servant, and you’ve been so kind to save our lives, but I can’t make it to the mountains. It’s so far from here; disaster will overtake me, and I’ll die!</verse>
				<verse number="20">Look, over there is a village close enough to run to, and it’s a small one. Let me escape there instead. You can see that it’s such a small village. Let my life be spared!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">“All right,” he replied. “I will grant this request too. I will not destroy that village.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Now, you must hurry. Run to that village, for I can’t do anything until you are there.” (That is why the village was called Zoar.)</verse>
				<verse number="23">By mid-morning, Lot arrived at the small village of Zoar,</verse>
				<verse number="24">And Yahweh ’s fire from heaven fell upon Sodom and Gomorrah.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He completely destroyed the cities of the plain, and all their inhabitants and whatever grew in the valley.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But Lot’s wife turned and gazed longingly on the city and turned into a pillar of salt.</verse>
				<verse number="27">That morning, Abraham hurried back to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Looking down toward all the land of the plain, he saw columns of smoke billowing up from Sodom and Gomorrah —like the smoke of a furnace!</verse>
				<verse number="29">So before God destroyed the cities of the plain where Lot had settled, he remembered his affection for Abraham and spared Lot from all the destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Afraid to remain in Zoar, Lot left there and settled in the hill country and lived in a cave with his two daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="31">One day, his firstborn suggested to the younger, “Our father is getting old, and there isn’t a man anywhere who could impregnate us in the normal way.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Come, let’s get our father drunk with wine and have sex with him. That way we can at least have children through our father.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">That night, they got their father drunk with wine, and the firstborn went in and slept with him. Lot was so drunk he didn’t have a clue about what had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="34">The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, “I slept with my father last night. Tonight, it’s your turn. We’ll get him drunk with wine, and you can sleep with him and we can preserve our family line through our father.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">So they got their father drunk the second time; and the younger went in and slept with him. He was once again so drunk he had no clue what had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="36">As a result, both Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.</verse>
				<verse number="37">The older daughter had a son named Moab, who is the ancestor of the Moabites of today.</verse>
				<verse number="38">The younger also had a son named Ben-Ammi, the ancestor of the Ammonites of today.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">Abraham journeyed from the oaks of Mamre to the southern region of Canaan and settled between Kadesh and Shur, to live as a temporary resident in Gerar.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now Abraham had said about his wife Sarah, “She’s my sister.” So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent for her and took her into his harem.</verse>
				<verse number="3">One night, God appeared to Abimelech in a dream and said to him, “You’re as good as dead, for you have taken into your harem a married woman!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now Abimelech had not touched Sarah, so he said to the Lord, “Would you really destroy people who are innocent?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Didn’t the man tell me, ‘She is my sister’? And didn’t she agree and say, ‘Yes, he’s my brother’? I’ve done this with clean hands and a clear conscience.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then God answered him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience. Furthermore, it was I who kept you from sinning and kept you from touching her.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now return the man’s wife, and because he is a prophet, he will intercede on your behalf that you may live. But if you don’t give her back—you will certainly die, you and your entire household.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">So Abimelech rose early in the morning and gathered all his servants. When he told them about his dream, they were terrified!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Abimelech summoned Abraham and asked him, “What is this trick you have played on us? I did nothing wrong to you. Why would you bring such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done to me what no one should ever do to another.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Abimelech asked, “What is your purpose in doing this?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Abraham answered, “Because I thought, ‘There’s no one here that fears God. They will kill me to get to my wife.’</verse>
				<verse number="12">Besides, she really is my half sister. She’s my father’s daughter, but not my mother’s, so I married her.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When God sent me out to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘Here is how you can show your love for me. Everywhere we go, you must say about me, “He’s my brother.” ’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Abimelech gave Abraham’s wife Sarah back to him. In addition, he gave him sheep, cattle, and both male and female servants.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Abimelech told him, “Look, my land is now before you; feel free to settle wherever you please.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then he turned to Sarah and said, “I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver as compensation to settle any claim against me, to exonerate you in the eyes of all who are with you, and to clear your reputation.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech! He also healed Abimelech’s wife and female servants of their infertility and they began to have babies again.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For Yahweh had shut all the wombs of the women of Abimelech’s household because he took Sarah, Abraham’s wife.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh visited Sarah, just as he said he would, and fulfilled his promise to her.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the exact time God had promised them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Abraham named his son Isaac, the miracle son, whom Sarah bore him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">And she added, “Who would ever have told Abraham that Sarah would one day nurse children! Even though Abraham is an old man, look—I have given him a son!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Isaac grew and was weaned; and on the day Sarah weaned him, Abraham prepared a great feast.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But Sarah noticed the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, was mocking her son Isaac.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So she said to Abraham, “Get rid of this slave woman and her son. Banish them, for the son of that slave woman must not become a coheir with my son Isaac!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Abraham was very upset over Sarah’s demand, for Ishmael was his son too.</verse>
				<verse number="12">God spoke to Abraham, “Don’t be distressed over the slave woman and her son. Listen to every word Sarah says to you, and do it, for it will be through Isaac your promise of descendants will be fulfilled.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Rest assured, I will make the son of your slave woman into a nation too, because he is your son.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Abraham rose up early the next morning, bundled up some food and a skin of water, and strapped them to Hagar’s shoulders. Then he gave her his son and sent them away. So, Hagar and her son Ishmael departed and wandered off into the wilderness of Beersheba.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When the water was gone, she grew desperate, so she left her son under a bush.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then she walked about the distance of a bowshot and sat down, for she thought, “I can’t bear to watch my son die.” As she sat nearby, she broke into tears and sobbed uncontrollably.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And God heard the voice of the boy. The angel of God called out to Hagar from the heavenly realm and said, “What’s the matter, Hagar? Don’t be afraid, for God has heard the voice of your son crying as he lies there.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Get up! Help the boy up and hold him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then God opened her eyes to reveal a well of water. She went over to the well and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a long, cool drink.</verse>
				<verse number="20">God was with Ishmael as he grew up in the wilderness of Paran. He became an expert archer,</verse>
				<verse number="21">and his mother, Hagar, arranged a marriage for him with an Egyptian woman.</verse>
				<verse number="22">At that time, King Abimelech and Phicol, his army commander, came to Abraham and said, “ It is obvious that God is with you and blesses everything you do.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now swear to me here before God that you will not deceive me, my children, or my descendants, but as I have shown you loyal friendship, so you will treat me—and the land in which you live as a foreigner—with loyal friendship.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">“I give you my oath,” Abraham answered.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But Abraham voiced a complaint about a well of water which Abimelech’s servants had seized by force.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Abimelech responded, “This is the first time I’ve heard about this; you never told me before now. I don’t know who has done this.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">So Abraham took sheep and cattle, gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then Abraham set apart from his flock seven ewe lambs,</verse>
				<verse number="29">and Abimelech asked him, “What are you doing with these seven ewe lambs you have set apart?”</verse>
				<verse number="30">He replied, “ I am giving them to you, and by accepting these seven ewe lambs, you acknowledge the proof that I dug this well and it belongs to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">That place was called Beersheba, because it was there that both men swore an oath to one another.</verse>
				<verse number="32">After completing their pact at Beersheba, King Abimelech and Phicol, his army commander, departed and returned to Philistine country.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he worshiped Yahweh, the everlasting God.</verse>
				<verse number="34">And Abraham lived many years in peace as a foreigner in Philistine country.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">Some time later, God tested Abraham. He said, “Abraham!” “Yes, I’m here,” Abraham answered.</verse>
				<verse number="2">God said, “Please take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom I know you dearly love, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him up to me as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will show you.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Early the next morning, Abraham cut the wood for the burnt offering, loaded it on his donkey, and set out for the distant place God had shown him. He took with him two of his servants, and his son Isaac.</verse>
				<verse number="4">On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Stay here with the donkey,” Abraham told the young men. “Isaac and I will go up and worship; then we will return to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on Isaac’s back. Abraham carried the knife and the fire, and the two of them walked up the mountain together.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Father?” Isaac broke the silence. “Yes, my son,” Abraham replied. “We have the wood and the fire,” Isaac said, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Abraham answered, “My son, God himself will provide the lamb for an offering.” So they went on together.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When they arrived at the place on Mount Moriah that God had shown him, Abraham built an altar and stacked the wood on it. He tied up his son Isaac and laid him on top of the wood on the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Abraham took the knife in his hand to plunge it into his son,</verse>
				<verse number="11">but the angel of Yahweh called to him from heaven, saying, “Abraham! Abraham!” “Yes, I’m here,” he answered.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Do not lay a hand on the boy or harm him,” he said, “for now, I know you are fully dedicated to me, since you did not withhold your son, your beloved son, from me.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">As Abraham looked up, his eyes fell upon a ram caught by its horns in a nearby thicket. Abraham took the ram and sacrificed it on the altar as a burnt offering in Isaac’s place.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So Abraham named that place Yahweh Appears. Even to this day, it is said, “On Yahweh ’s Mountain there is vision.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh ’s angel spoke a second time from heaven:</verse>
				<verse number="16">“ ‘I solemnly promise you, by the glory of my own name,’ decrees Yahweh, ‘because you have obeyed my voice and did not withhold from me your son—your beloved son — I will greatly bless you! I will make sure your seed becomes as numerous as the stars of heaven and as the sand of the seashore. Your offspring will take possession of the city gates of their enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="17"></verse>
				<verse number="18">Because you have obeyed me, the entire world will be blessed through your seed.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So Abraham and Isaac returned to the waiting servants, and they departed for Beersheba, where Abraham had settled.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Some time later Abraham heard the news, “ You’re an uncle! Milcah and your brother Nahor have eight sons: Uz, their firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, Chesed, Hazo, Phildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel the father of Rebekah.”</verse>
				<verse number="21"></verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23"></verse>
				<verse number="24">Moreover, Nahor had another wife, Reumah, who also had four sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="23">
				<verse number="1">Sarah lived to be one hundred and twenty-seven.</verse>
				<verse number="2">She died in the land of Canaan at Kiriath Arba, now known as Hebron. There Abraham mourned and wept for her.</verse>
				<verse number="3">After his time of mourning was over, Abraham got up from where her body lay, and went to speak with the Hittites. He said to them,</verse>
				<verse number="4">“I live as an alien and stranger among you. Sell me some of your property so I can use it as a burial site for my wife.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Hear us, my lord,” the Hittites answered, “you are a mighty prince of God among us. You may bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us would withhold our burial ground from you.”</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">Then Abraham bowed respectfully before the Hittites, the people of the land</verse>
				<verse number="8">and he said to them, “If you are willing to allow my wife a proper burial, then please hear me out. On my behalf please persuade your countryman, Ephron the son of Zohar,</verse>
				<verse number="9">to sell me the cave he owns at Machpelah on the edge of his land. Let him sell it to me publicly and at the full price, so that I may own it for a burial site.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now Ephron the Hittite was sitting there among his countrymen. He spoke up so all the Hittites who sat at the gate as elders of the city could hear him, and said,</verse>
				<verse number="11">“No, my lord, listen. I will give you not only the cave but also the entire field! In the presence of my people, I will give it to you to bury your dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Abraham bowed low before the people of the land,</verse>
				<verse number="13">and he said to Ephron in the hearing of all the people, “No, please listen, kind sir. I will pay whatever the field is worth. Take my money so that I can bury my dead there.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“If you insist, my lord,” answered Ephron. “But what is a piece of land worth only four hundred silver shekels to men of our standing? Go ahead and bury your dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16">So Abraham agreed to the amount, weighed out the four hundred silver shekels according to the merchant’s standard of weight, and in the presence of the Hittites he gave the money to Ephron.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So Ephron’s field of Machpelah, east of Mamre, along with the cave and all the trees within its borders, passed</verse>
				<verse number="18">to Abraham as his legal possession. The complete transaction was carried out in the presence of the Hittites—those who sat as elders at the city gates.</verse>
				<verse number="19">After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave there in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (now Hebron) in the land of Canaan.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Both the field and the cave passed from the Hittites to Abraham’s possession to be his family burial ground.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="24">
				<verse number="1">Now, Yahweh had wonderfully blessed Abraham in every way, and he became a very old man, well advanced in years.</verse>
				<verse number="2">One day, Abraham called for his trusted head servant, who was in charge of all that he had, and said “Please, put your hand here under my thigh,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not acquire a wife for my son among the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Promise me you will go instead to my relatives in my native land and find a wife among them for my son Isaac.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The servant asked him, “Suppose the woman is not willing to come back with me to this land. Should I then take your son back to your native land?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Absolutely not,” Abraham answered, “make sure that you do not take my son back there.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For Yahweh, the God of heaven, took me from my father’s house and from the land of my birth. He spoke to me and solemnly promised that he would give this land to my descendants. I know he will send his angel before you so that you can find a wife for my son from there.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And if for any reason the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you are released from this oath that you swear to me. But no matter what, do not take my son back there!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">So, the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to carry out his wishes.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So the servant took ten of his master’s camels, loaded them with all sorts of gifts, some of the best things his master owned, and journeyed toward the distant land of Mesopotamia until he got to the village where Abraham’s brother Nahor had lived.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He had his camels kneel by a well outside the village. It was evening, the time when the women came out to draw water.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He prayed: “ Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, let my journey here be a success and show your gracious love to my master Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I am standing here by this well, and the young women of the village are coming out to draw water. Give me a sign.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will say to one of the girls, ‘Please, lower your jar and give me a drink.’ And if she is the right one, the girl whom you have chosen to be a wife for your servant Isaac, then let her say to me, ‘Drink, and I will also draw water for your camels.’ By this sign I will know that you have shown your gracious love to my master.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Suddenly, before he had finished praying, there was Rebekah approaching the well with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel and the granddaughter of Milcah and Abraham’s brother Nahor.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The young woman was strikingly beautiful, unmarried, and still a virgin. She walked down to the well, filled her jar, and came back up.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Abraham’s servant hurried over to meet her and said, “Please, lower your jar and give me a little drink.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">She responded, “Drink, my lord.” She then quickly lowered her jar to give him a drink.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then, after she had finished giving him a drink, she added, “I will also draw water for your camels until they have finished drinking.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">She quickly emptied her jar into the watering trough and ran back to the well to draw more water, until she had watered all the camels.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Meanwhile, the servant stared at her, silently pondering whether Yahweh had indeed made his journey successful.</verse>
				<verse number="22">After the camels had finished drinking, he took a costly gold nose ring weighing a half shekel and two solid gold bracelets weighing ten shekels, and gave them to Rebekah.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then he asked her, “Tell me, who is your father? Is there room in your father’s house for me and my men to stay tonight?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">She replied, “My father’s name is Bethuel, and my grandparents are Milcah and Nahor.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">She went on, “There is room for you to spend the night at our home, and plenty of straw and food for the camels.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Upon hearing this, the servant bowed down and worshiped Yahweh,</verse>
				<verse number="27">saying, “Praised be Yahweh, the God of Abraham, for you have faithfully kept your promise to my master and displayed your wonderful kindness and love. Yahweh, you led me straight to the very place of my master’s relatives!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then the girl quickly ran to inform her mother and family about all that had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Now Rebekah had an older brother named Laban, and when he heard everything the man had told his sister and saw her gold nose ring and the costly bracelets dangling on her wrists, Laban ran out to meet the man waiting at the well—and there he was standing beside his camels.</verse>
				<verse number="30"></verse>
				<verse number="31">Then Laban said to the man, “Friend, Yahweh has wonderfully blessed you; please, come to my home. Why are you standing out here when I have prepared the house for you and a place for your camels?”</verse>
				<verse number="32">So the man came into the house, and his camels were unloaded and given straw and feed. The servants brought water to wash the man’s feet and the feet of the men with him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But when they set food before him, he said, “I won’t eat until I tell you why I’m here.” “Please, tell us,” Laban said.</verse>
				<verse number="34">“I am Abraham’s servant,” he began.</verse>
				<verse number="35">“ Yahweh has wonderfully blessed my master, and he has become extremely wealthy. Yahweh has given him flocks and herds, camels and donkeys, a fortune in silver and gold, and many male and female servants.</verse>
				<verse number="36">And my master’s wife, Sarah, has miraculously borne him a son in her old age, and my master’s son is the sole heir of his fortune.</verse>
				<verse number="37">My master has put me under an oath saying, ‘Do not get a wife for my son from among the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Instead, go to my relatives in my native land and find a wife among them for my son.’</verse>
				<verse number="39">In reply I said to my master, ‘Suppose the woman refuses to return with me.’</verse>
				<verse number="40">He answered me, ‘ Yahweh, in whose presence I have walked all these years, will send his angel with you and will make your mission successful. You will find a wife for my son from among my relatives, my father’s family.</verse>
				<verse number="41">If you go to my relatives, and they will not give her to you, then and only then will you be released from this oath.’</verse>
				<verse number="42">So, when I arrived at the well today, I prayed, ‘O  Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, make my mission a success.</verse>
				<verse number="43">I’m here standing at this well. May the right girl for my master’s son come out to draw water. And when she does, I will say to her “Please give me a little drink from your jar.”</verse>
				<verse number="44">And if she replies, saying, “Drink, and I will also draw water for your camels,” then I might know that she is the young woman Yahweh has chosen for my master’s son.’</verse>
				<verse number="45">“Before I had even finished my heartfelt prayer, there was Rebekah coming out with her water jar on her shoulder! After she went down to the well and filled her jar, I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’</verse>
				<verse number="46">She quickly lowered her jar and said, ‘Drink, and I will also draw water for your camels.’ So, I drank, and she also watered the camels.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Then I asked her, ‘Tell me, who is your father?’ She said, ‘I’m the daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ When I learned she was of my master’s family, I put a gold ring in her nose and gold bracelets on her wrists,</verse>
				<verse number="48">and I bowed before Yahweh and worshiped him. I praised Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who led me perfectly on the right path to find the very daughter of my master’s brother to marry his son.</verse>
				<verse number="49">Now, if you will show faithful love to my master and do what is right, then give me permission to take Rebekah back to his land. If not, tell me, and I will go on my way.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">After hearing this, Laban and Bethuel said, “This was all planned by Yahweh! If this is his plan, what can we say?</verse>
				<verse number="51">Here stands our Rebekah before you. You may take her and go and let her marry your master’s son and fulfill Yahweh ’s plan for her.”</verse>
				<verse number="52">When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed his face down to the ground and worshiped Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="53">Then he brought expensive jewelry of silver and gold and exquisitely embroidered garments, and gave them all to Rebekah, and he gave costly gifts to her brother and her mother.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Afterward, the servant and his men ate and drank, and they spent the night in Laban’s home. First thing in the morning, he said to them, “Allow me now to return to my master.”</verse>
				<verse number="55">Her brother and mother replied, “Please let Rebekah remain with us a while—for ten days or so, then she may go with you.”</verse>
				<verse number="56">He responded, “Please, Yahweh has made my mission successful. Send me off with her to my master, don’t make me wait.”</verse>
				<verse number="57">They answered him, “We will call for Rebekah and see what she wants to do.”</verse>
				<verse number="58">So they called for Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?” “I will gladly go with him,” she answered.</verse>
				<verse number="59">So they sent their sister Rebekah away with her servant girls to go with Abraham’s servant and his men.</verse>
				<verse number="60">As she departed, they blessed her with these words: “Our dear sister, may you become thousands of ten thousands! May your descendants gain possession of the city gates of their foes!”</verse>
				<verse number="61">Then Rebekah and her servant girls mounted the camels and followed the servant and his men.</verse>
				<verse number="62">Meanwhile, Isaac, who was living in the southern desert of Canaan, had just come back to his camp from the Well of the Living One Who Watches Over Me.</verse>
				<verse number="63">Isaac went out in the evening into the field to meditate. He looked up, and saw camels coming in the distance.</verse>
				<verse number="64">As Rebekah got closer, she raised her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she nearly fell off her camel!</verse>
				<verse number="65">She whispered to the servant, “Who is that man walking in the field toward us?” “Why, he’s the one about whom I told you, that’s my young master!” the servant said. So Rebekah quickly took her veil and covered her face.</verse>
				<verse number="66">Then the servant began to explain to Isaac in detail all the amazing things that had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="67">Isaac fell in love with Rebekah. He took her to be his wife, and they were married, and he brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent. In this way, Isaac was greatly comforted after his mother’s death.</verse>

			<chapter number="25">
				<verse number="1">Now Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">She and Abraham had sons named Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Dedan’s sons were the Ashurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites. Midian’s sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the descendants of Keturah.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Abraham gave all that he possessed to Isaac,</verse>
				<verse number="6">but to his sons by his concubines he gave gifts while he was still living. He sent them all away eastward, separating them from his son Isaac.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Abraham lived a total of one hundred and seventy-five years.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Abraham took his final breath, dying at a good old age. After having lived a full, content life, he joined his ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="9">His sons, Isaac and Ishmael, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field which had belonged to Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They buried him next to his wife Sarah, in the same field that Abraham purchased from the Hittites.</verse>
				<verse number="11">After Abraham had passed, God greatly blessed his son Isaac, and Isaac settled near the well named the Well of the Living One Who Watches Over Me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">This is the account of the descendants of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Sarah’s servant, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The names of Ishmael’s sons in their birth order are: Nebaioth the firstborn; and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</verse>
				<verse number="14">Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</verse>
				<verse number="15">Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.</verse>
				<verse number="16">These twelve sons of Ishmael became princes of twelve tribes that were named after them, listed by the places they settled and camped.</verse>
				<verse number="17">They occupied the land from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt, in the direction of Assyria. And Ishmael lived in hostility toward all of his people. At the age of one hundred and thirty-seven, Ishmael breathed his last and died and was joined to his ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="18"></verse>
				<verse number="19">This is how the story of Isaac begins. He was the beloved son of Abraham and the successor of Abraham’s blessing.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When he was forty, he married Rebekah. She was the daughter of Bethuel and the sister of Laban. Both her father and brother were Arameans from Paddan-Aram.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Now, Rebekah was unable to have children, but Isaac pleaded with Yahweh on behalf of his wife because she was barren—and she did get pregnant, for Yahweh responded to Isaac’s prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="22">During her pregnancy, Rebekah could feel twins thrashing and struggling with each other inside her womb. So she went to inquire of Yahweh, saying, “Why do I have to live with this?”</verse>
				<verse number="23">And Yahweh answered her, saying, “The two sons in your womb will become two nations, and the two peoples within you will become rivals. One people will become stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">And when the time came for Rebekah to give birth, sure enough, she had twins!</verse>
				<verse number="25">The first one came out reddish and covered with hair like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And his brother came out with his hand grasping Esau’s heel; so, they named him Jacob. Isaac was sixty when the twins were born.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When the boys grew up, Esau became a rugged outdoorsman and a hardy hunter, but Jacob was more contemplative, content to stay close to home.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Isaac loved Esau because he was fond of eating wild game, but Rebekah dearly loved Jacob.</verse>
				<verse number="29">One day, when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau returned from hunting, and he was famished.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Smelling the aroma of food, Esau said to Jacob, “I’m starving! Let me eat some of that red stuff you’re cooking.” (This is why he is also called Edom.)</verse>
				<verse number="31">“Yes, but first you must trade me your birthright,” Jacob replied.</verse>
				<verse number="32">“Can’t you see I’m dying of hunger?” Esau said. “What good is the birthright if I’m dead?”</verse>
				<verse number="33">But Jacob insisted, “First, swear to me that you’ll give it to me.” So, Esau swore an oath and surrendered his birthright to Jacob.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then Jacob gave Esau some lentil stew and bread. When Esau had finished eating and drinking, he just got up and walked away. Esau cared nothing about his own birthright.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="26">
				<verse number="1">Now, another famine struck the land, like the one in Abraham’s time. Isaac traveled to Gerar where Abimelech was the Philistine king.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh appeared before Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt. Stay in the land that I will reveal to you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Live there as a foreigner, and my presence will be with you. I promise to bless you, for I will give all these lands to you and your descendants. I will fulfill the oath I swore to your father Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven, and I will one day give them all these lands. I will bless all the nations of the earth through your offspring</verse>
				<verse number="5">because Abraham was faithful to me. He listened to my voice and yielded his heart to follow my direction. He kept my commandments, my instructions, and my teachings.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So Isaac settled in Gerar.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The men of the land noticed Rebekah’s beauty and asked Isaac about her. “Oh, she’s just my sister,” he replied. Rebekah was indeed very beautiful, and he was afraid to tell them, “She’s my wife,” for he thought that the men of the land would kill him and take his wife.</verse>
				<verse number="8">One day, after Isaac had lived there awhile, the Philistine king Abimelech looked out his window and saw Isaac affectionately caressing his wife Rebekah.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, “So, this woman is your wife! Why did you say that she was your sister?” “Because I thought the men of the land would kill me and take her,” Isaac said.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Don’t you realize what you’ve done to us?” Abimelech asked. “One of our men might have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt and punishment upon us!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So Abimelech issued a stern warning to all the people, saying, “Whoever lays a hand on this man or his wife shall be put to death!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Isaac planted crops in that land, and in the same year reaped a hundred-fold harvest, for Yahweh greatly blessed him!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Isaac grew richer and richer until he was extremely wealthy.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He acquired so many flocks and herds and so many servants that the Philistines grew jealous,</verse>
				<verse number="15">so the Philistines stopped up all of Isaac’s wells and filled them with dirt—the same wells his father’s servants had dug in the time of Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Eventually Abimelech’s jealousy got the better of him, and he said to Isaac, “You must leave us! You have become too rich and powerful for us!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">So Isaac departed from Abimelech’s domain and camped near the Wadi of Gerar, where he settled.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Isaac reopened and restored the wells his father Abraham had originally dug—the wells the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham’s death. And Isaac gave these wells the same names that his father had given them.</verse>
				<verse number="19">One day, when Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, they uncovered a spring-fed well.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But the herdsmen of Gerar picked a fight with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “That’s our well!” So Isaac named the well Argument because of the sharp contention.</verse>
				<verse number="21">They dug a second well, and it also caused a quarrel, so Isaac named that well Hostility.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then he pulled up stakes from there and dug a third well, but this one was dug without any quarreling, so Isaac named it Spacious, saying, “Finally, Yahweh has made ample room for us and we will become prosperous in the land!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">From there, Isaac moved his camp to Beersheba.</verse>
				<verse number="24">That very night, Yahweh appeared before him and said: “I am the God of Abraham your father. You will never need to fear a thing for I am with you and I will greatly bless you. Your children will flourish and succeed because of the promises I gave my servant Abraham.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">So Isaac built an altar, prayed, and worshiped Yahweh there. He pitched his tent there, and his servants started digging another well.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then King Abimelech came to Isaac from Gerar with his adviser Ahuzzath and his army commander Phicol.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me now, since you hated me and sent me away?”</verse>
				<verse number="28">They answered, “We have witnessed firsthand how powerfully Yahweh ’s favor has been with you, so we say, let there be a peace treaty among us. Let us make a covenant</verse>
				<verse number="29">to do each other no harm. Swear to us that you will not trouble us, just as we have not troubled you and have always treated you well and sent you away in peace. Now look at how Yahweh has blessed you!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">So Isaac prepared a wonderful feast for them, and they all ate and drank together.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then the next morning, they got up early and exchanged oaths. Isaac said goodbye to them, and they left Isaac in peace.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Later that same day, Isaac’s servants came with wonderful news about the well they had dug, saying, “We’ve just found water!”</verse>
				<verse number="33">So he named it Oath. This is why the city where they dug the well is called Beersheba to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="34">When Esau was forty, he married two Hittite women, Judith the daughter of Beeri and Basemath the daughter of Elon.</verse>
				<verse number="35">They made life miserable for Isaac and Rebekah.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="27">
				<verse number="1">When Isaac was very old and blind, he called for his oldest son, Esau, and asked him, “My son?” “ I am here, father,” Esau answered.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“As you can see, I am now an old man,” Isaac said. “And I may die any day now.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So please take your hunting gear—your bow and arrows—and go out into the field and hunt some wild game for me.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then prepare me a savory meal, the food I love, and bring it to me. After I eat it, I will bless you from my innermost being before I die.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now, Rebekah was eavesdropping on their conversation. So, when Esau left for the field to hunt for game to cook for Isaac,</verse>
				<verse number="6">she found Jacob and said to him, “I just overheard your father say to your brother Esau,</verse>
				<verse number="7">‘Bring me some wild game and prepare a savory meal for me. Afterward I will bless you in the presence of Yahweh before I die.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">Listen carefully, my son, and do everything I tell you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Go out to the flock and bring me two of the best young goats. I’ll cook them for your father and prepare a delicious meal, the way he loves it.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then, you take it to him to eat and your father will bless you before he dies.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Jacob objected, “But my brother Esau is covered with hair, and I’m smooth skinned.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If my father feels my hairless skin, he’ll know I’m not Esau. He’ll think I’m a trickster, and I’ll end up bringing a curse upon myself rather than a blessing!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“My son,” his mother said, “let any curse against you fall on me alone! Just do what I say and go and get the goats for me.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">So he went and got the goats and brought them to his mother. She prepared a delicious meal, just the way his father loved it.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then Rebekah picked out the best clothes of her older son Esau and put them on her younger son Jacob.</verse>
				<verse number="16">She covered Jacob’s hands and the soft part of his neck with goatskins.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then she handed Jacob the tasty dish and the bread that she had prepared</verse>
				<verse number="18">and he took them to Isaac. “Father?” Jacob said. Isaac replied, “Which one of my sons are you?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jacob answered, “It’s I—Esau—your firstborn. I have done as you asked. Please, sit up. Eat some of this delicious game you love so that you may give me your innermost blessing.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Isaac asked his son, “How in the world did you find game so quickly, my son?” “ Yahweh, your God, caused it to come right to me,” he replied.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please, please, come closer that I may touch you, my son. I need to really know for certain that you are Esau.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">So Jacob inched closer to his father Isaac, who felt his skin and said, “You sound like Jacob, but your hands are Esau’s.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s, Isaac was tricked and did not recognize that it was really Jacob. As he was about to give him his blessing,</verse>
				<verse number="24">Isaac asked him again, “Are you really my son Esau?” Jacob answered, “I am.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Then bring the food to me,” Isaac said, “and let me eat my son’s game. Then I will give you my blessing.” So, Jacob gave his father the food and he ate it. He brought him wine and he drank it.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then Isaac said to him, “My son, come near and kiss me.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">So he came near and kissed him. Isaac recognized the smell of his son’s clothes and blessed him, saying, “Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a lush field that Yahweh has blessed!</verse>
				<verse number="28">May God give you heaven’s dew, the fatness of earth, and an abundance of grain and new wine!</verse>
				<verse number="29">Let peoples serve you and nations bow down to you! May you be master over your brothers and may your mother’s sons bow down to you! Those who curse you will be cursed and those who bless you will be blessed!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">No sooner had Jacob left from receiving the blessing of his father Isaac, than his brother Esau arrived home from hunting.</verse>
				<verse number="31">He too prepared a savory meal for his father and took it to him. He said to Isaac, “Sit up my father; eat some of your son’s wild game so that you can give me your innermost blessing.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">His father Isaac asked him, “Who are you?” “I’m Esau, your firstborn son,” he answered.</verse>
				<verse number="33">When Isaac realized what had happened, he began to tremble and shake violently. He asked, “Who was it then that hunted wild game and brought it to me? I’ve already eaten it all before you came, and I gave him the blessing—yes, and he will be blessed indeed!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">When Esau heard his father’s words, he burst into bitter weeping and uncontrollable sobbing. He said to his father, “ Bless me! Bless me too, father!”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Isaac answered, “Your brother was here and deceived me. He has taken away your blessing.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Esau exclaimed, “Jacob, that heel grabber —the name fits him perfectly! Now he has tricked me twice! He stole my birthright, and now he’s robbed me of my blessing!” Then he asked, “ Father, haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Isaac replied, “ You don’t understand. My blessing will empower him to be master over you. I have already given him all his brothers and relatives as servants. My blessing will richly provide him with grain and new wine. What more is left for me to do for you, my son?”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Esau pleaded with his father, “Is that the only blessing you have to give? Bless me too, my father!” Esau could not hold back his tears and he wept loudly.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Then Isaac his father spoke these words: “You will live far from earth’s bounty and far from heaven’s dew on high.</verse>
				<verse number="40">You will live by the sword and serve your brother; but when you grow restless, you will break free from his control.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Esau hated Jacob because he stole his blessing. He said to himself, “In a short time my father will be gone. After the time for mourning his death has passed, I will kill my brother Jacob!”</verse>
				<verse number="42">But when Rebekah found out about her older son Esau’s plan, she quickly sent for her younger son Jacob, and said to him, “Listen, your brother Esau is planning to exact revenge by killing you.</verse>
				<verse number="43">My son, you must do what I say. Run away at once to my brother Laban in Haran.</verse>
				<verse number="44">You can live with him for a while until your brother calms down.</verse>
				<verse number="45">After your brother’s anger has died down and he has forgotten what you’ve done to him, I will send a messenger to bring you back from there. Why should I lose both my sons in one day?”</verse>
				<verse number="46">Later, Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m so disgusted with our Hittite daughters-in-law. I’d rather die than see Jacob marry one of these local girls—these Hittite women!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="28">
				<verse number="1">Before Jacob left, Isaac called for him, blessed him, and gave him these instructions: “I forbid you to marry any Canaanite woman.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Leave at once for the land of your grandfather Bethuel in Paddan-Aram and find one of the young women there to marry, one of your uncle Laban’s daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="3">May the God who is always more than enough bless you abundantly. May he make you fruitful and multiply your descendants until you become many tribes!</verse>
				<verse number="4">May he impart to you and your seed the blessing of Abraham so that you may possess the land where you now live as a foreigner—the land God gave to Abraham.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way to Paddan-Aram, the land of his grandfather Bethuel the Aramean, to the home of Laban, Bethuel’s son and the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Esau had learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him away to Paddan-Aram to find a wife there, and that while blessing him, Isaac had instructed him, “Don’t marry a Canaanite woman.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Furthermore, Esau found out that Jacob had obeyed his parents and fled to Paddan-Aram.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Esau, knowing that his father Isaac disapproved of Canaanite women,</verse>
				<verse number="9">went to Ishmael’s clan and chose a woman named Mahalath to be one of his wives. She was the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, and sister of Nebaioth.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jacob left Beersheba and journeyed toward Haran.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He encountered a certain place at sunset and camped there for the night. He took a stone from there, made it his pillow, and lay down to sleep.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He had a dream of a stairway securely fixed on the earth and reaching into heaven. And there were messengers of God ascending and descending on the stairway.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And Yahweh stood beside him and said to him, “I am Yahweh, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. You are lying on the very ground that I will give to you and your descendants.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They will become as numerous as the specks of dust on the earth, and they will extend their territory in all directions. Through you and your descendants, I will bless the whole world.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Never forget—I am always with you and will protect you wherever you go. And one day I will bring you back to this land, for I will neither leave you nor fail to fulfill every word I have promised you.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">When Jacob awoke from his dream, he was overcome with awe and said, “ Yahweh is here! He is in this place and I didn’t realize it!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Terrified and overwhelmed, he said, “How awesome is this place! I have stumbled right into the House of God! This place is a portal, the very gate of heaven!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Early in the morning, Jacob took the stone he had under his head, set it up as a pillar and anointed it by pouring oil over the top of it.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He named that place Bethel; though the city was once called Luz.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then Jacob committed himself to God, saying, “If you will always be with me and protect me on this long journey, and if you give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,</verse>
				<verse number="21">and if I return safely to my father’s house, then Yahweh, you will be my God!</verse>
				<verse number="22">See! I have set up this sacred stone pillar and it will be your house, God. I promise to set aside a tenth of all that you give me as my gift to you.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="29">
				<verse number="1">Jacob resumed his journey and entered the land east of Canaan.</verse>
				<verse number="2">One day, Jacob came to a well out in the open country where the shepherds watered their animals. Three flocks of sheep and goats were lying near the well, which had a large, heavy stone covering the opening.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Whenever all the flocks gathered there, the shepherds would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well, water their sheep, and then roll the stone back over the top of the well.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jacob approached them and said, “Good day, friends; where are you from?” “We’re from Haran,” they answered.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Do you happen to know Laban, a grandson of Nahor?” Jacob said. “We do,” they replied.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jacob asked, “How’s he doing?” “He’s doing well,” they answered. “As a matter of fact, here comes his daughter Rachel right now with her flock.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jacob said to them, “Look, it’s not time for the animals to gather together here; it’s now the hottest hour of the day. Let’s go ahead and water the sheep, then you can go and pasture them.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">They replied, “First, we have to wait until all the flocks are gathered. After that, the stone needs to be rolled away from the mouth of the well, then we’ll water the animals.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">While they were still speaking, Rachel, the shepherdess, drew near to the well with her father’s sheep.</verse>
				<verse number="10">As soon as Jacob took one good look at Rachel, the beautiful daughter of his uncle Laban, he quickly went over to the mouth of the well and single-handedly rolled away the stone and watered all the flock of his uncle Laban!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Immediately, he walked up to Rachel and kissed her! Unable to hold back his tears, Jacob wept aloud.</verse>
				<verse number="12">After he composed himself, he explained to Rachel, “I’m your father’s nephew, your aunt Rebekah’s son.” Upon hearing this, Rachel ran to tell her father.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When Laban heard the news that his nephew Jacob had arrived at the well, he ran to greet him. Laban hugged and kissed Jacob and welcomed him into his home. After Jacob told him the story of all that happened,</verse>
				<verse number="14">Laban said to him, “Certainly, you are my own flesh and blood!” Jacob stayed with him for an entire month and worked for him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Afterward, Laban said to Jacob, “Just because you’re my relative doesn’t mean I expect you to work for nothing. Tell me, what do you want your wages to be?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">(Now, Laban had two daughters; the older was Leah, and the younger was Rachel.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Rachel had a lovely figure and was gorgeous, but Leah’s eyes were weak.)</verse>
				<verse number="18">Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel, so he answered Laban, “I will serve you for seven years for the hand of your younger daughter, Rachel!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Laban replied, “I’d rather give her to you than to some other man. Stay and work for me.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">So Jacob served Laban for seven years in exchange for Rachel, but because he loved her so deeply, the seven years seemed like only a few days.</verse>
				<verse number="21">After the seven years, Jacob said to Laban, “My time is fulfilled; give me your daughter so that I may marry her and sleep with her.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">So Laban prepared a wedding feast and invited all the people of the surrounding area.</verse>
				<verse number="23">That night, Laban tricked Jacob by bringing his older daughter Leah to Jacob’s tent, and he slept with her on his wedding night!</verse>
				<verse number="24">(Laban assigned Zilpah to be Leah’s servant.)</verse>
				<verse number="25">When Jacob woke up the next morning, he was shocked to find Leah lying next to him! So he confronted Laban and said, “What have you done to me? Didn’t I serve you these seven years for Rachel? Why have you tricked me?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Laban answered, “It’s not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older daughter is married.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Wait until this bridal week of festivities is over, then I’ll give you Rachel, but you must serve me for another seven years.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Jacob complied with Laban’s request. After he completed the prescribed week of Leah’s wedding feast, Laban gave his daughter Rachel to be his wife, and he slept with her. Rachel was his true love, not Leah. (Laban assigned Bilhah as his daughter Rachel’s servant.) And Jacob remained there serving Laban for another seven years.</verse>
				<verse number="29"></verse>
				<verse number="30"></verse>
				<verse number="31">When Yahweh saw that Leah was unloved, he opened her womb, but Rachel remained childless.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Leah conceived, gave birth to a son, and named him Reuben, saying, “Because Yahweh looked upon me with compassion in my misery, surely, my husband will love me now!”</verse>
				<verse number="33">She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and named him Simeon, saying, “ Yahweh has heard that I am despised, and in his mercy, he has given me this son also.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Leah conceived the third time, gave birth to a son, and named him Levi, saying, “This time my husband will be joined to me, because now I’ve given him three sons!”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Once again, Leah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Judah, saying, “This time I will praise the Lord!” Then she stopped bearing children for a while.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="30">
				<verse number="1">When Rachel saw that she could not give Jacob children, her jealousy toward her sister simmered. So, she said to Jacob, “Give me sons, or I’ll die!”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Jacob became furious with Rachel and said, “Am I God? He’s the one keeping you from bearing children!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">She replied, “Here’s my servant Bilhah. Sleep with her. She can be my surrogate; then I can have children through her and build a family.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Rachel gave her servant Bilhah to Jacob as another wife, and Jacob slept with her.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and Rachel named him Dan, saying, “God has vindicated me. He heard my voice and gave me a son.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then her servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Rachel named him Naphtali, saying, “I have wrestled mightily with my sister, and I won!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Meanwhile, when Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as another wife.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Zilpah bore Jacob a son, and Leah named him Gad, saying, “What good fortune!”</verse>
				<verse number="11"></verse>
				<verse number="12">Zilpah bore Jacob a second son,</verse>
				<verse number="13">and Leah named him Asher, saying, “Oh happy day! All the women will say, ‘She’s happy now!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="14">One day, during wheat harvest, Reuben found some mandrake plants in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Leah replied, “You already took away the affection of my husband, so now you’re going to take my son’s mandrakes, too?” Rachel said, “All right then, I’ll let him sleep with you tonight in exchange for some of your son’s mandrakes.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">That evening, when Jacob was coming home from the field, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must sleep with me tonight, for I’ve paid for your services with my son’s mandrakes.” So Jacob slept with Leah that night.</verse>
				<verse number="17">God listened compassionately to Leah’s cry, she became pregnant, and bore Jacob a fifth son,</verse>
				<verse number="18">whom she named Issachar, saying, “God rewarded me for giving my maidservant to my husband.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Once again, Leah conceived and bore Jacob a sixth son,</verse>
				<verse number="20">whom she named Zebulun, saying, “God has given me good gifts for my husband! Now he will accept me, for I’ve given him six sons.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Lastly, Leah gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.</verse>
				<verse number="22">God listened to Rachel’s heart-cry, and had compassion on her, and made her fertile.</verse>
				<verse number="23">She conceived, and bore a son, and named him Joseph, saying, “God has taken away my disgrace. May Yahweh add to me another son.”</verse>
				<verse number="24"></verse>
				<verse number="25">After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Release me to go back home to my homeland.</verse>
				<verse number="26">You know how hard I’ve worked for you these many years to finish paying for my two wives. Give them to me along with my children, and I’ll be on my way.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Laban countered, “If you please, I have learned by divine inquiry that I have become prosperous because of you and the blessing of Yahweh that’s on your life.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Just name your price, and I’ll give it to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jacob replied, “You know how hard I’ve worked for you and how your livestock has increased under my care.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The little you had before I came has multiplied greatly, for Yahweh has blessed you wonderfully because I am here. But now, I need to provide for my own family, too.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">So Laban asked, “What should I give you?” “Nothing,” Jacob replied, “You don’t need to give me a thing. If you will do but one thing for me, I will continue to care for your flocks:</verse>
				<verse number="32">Just let me pass through all your flocks today and take out every speckled and spotted sheep or goat, and every black lamb. That’s all the payment I ask.</verse>
				<verse number="33">And in the future, when you review my wages, the integrity of my dealings with you will be obvious. If you find any animal among mine that is not speckled, spotted, or black, then you will know that I stole it.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">“Agreed!” Laban said. “We’ll do what you’ve suggested.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">But that same day, Laban secretly removed all the male and female goats that were speckled or spotted (all that had white on them) and all the black lambs and left them under the care of his sons.</verse>
				<verse number="36">He set a distance of a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban’s flocks.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Jacob, however, cut green branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled back part of their bark, to expose the white inner wood of the branches.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then he set the partially peeled branches inside the water troughs where the goats would see them when they came to drink.</verse>
				<verse number="39">For they mated when they came to the water troughs, and as they lowered their heads to drink, they saw the stripped branches in front of their eyes. Miraculously they gave birth to streaked, speckled, and spotted young.</verse>
				<verse number="40">But with the mating ewes, on the other hand, he made them face the streaked or completely black animals in Laban’s flock. By doing this, he produced his own special flocks, which he didn’t allow to mingle with Laban’s.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Moreover, every time the stronger females were in heat, Jacob laid the partially peeled branches in the water troughs in front of the flock, so that they would mate among the branches.</verse>
				<verse number="42">But he didn’t place the branches in front of the scrawny goats when they mated, leaving the feeble animals for Laban and the stronger for himself.</verse>
				<verse number="43">In this way, Jacob quickly grew very wealthy and owned large flocks, a great number of camels and donkeys, and many male and female servants.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="31">
				<verse number="1">Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were complaining, “Everything Jacob owns he has taken from our father! He gained all his wealth from what our father owned.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">And Jacob saw that Laban no longer viewed him favorably as he once did.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Yahweh said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your ancestors where you were born; and remember, I will be with you.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Jacob sent a message for Leah and Rachel to meet him in the field where his flocks were grazing.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When they arrived, he said to them, “I can see that your father’s attitude toward me has changed, but the God of my father has been with me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You both know I have worked for your father as hard as I could,</verse>
				<verse number="7">although he has cheated me and reduced my wages over and over. Yet God has not allowed him to harm me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">If he said, ‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled. If he said, ‘The striped ones will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore striped.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Because of these miracles, God has taken away your father’s livestock and given them to me!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jacob continued, “Once during the breeding season, I had a dream. I saw that the male goats who were mating were all speckled, streaked, or spotted.</verse>
				<verse number="11">In the dream, the angel of God called me by my name, ‘Jacob.’ ” “ ‘I am here,’ I answered.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Then he said, ‘Observe and note that all the male goats that are mating are speckled, streaked, or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I am the God who appeared to you at Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and return to the land of your birth.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Rachel and Leah answered him, “Our father doesn’t want us to inherit a portion from his estate.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Hasn’t he treated us as outsiders and not as members of his family? Not only did he sell us like property, but he has also spent our purchase price!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Our father’s wealth that God has given you was legally ours and our children to begin with! So, go ahead and do whatever God has told you.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jacob immediately put his wives and children on camels</verse>
				<verse number="18">and took with him all the livestock and everything he had amassed in Paddan-Aram. He set out to return to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.</verse>
				<verse number="19">One day, when Laban had gone to his fields to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household idols.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Jacob had outwitted Laban the Aramean by secretly departing without telling him.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He fled with all that he had, and after crossing the Euphrates, he headed for the hill country of Gilead.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And it wasn’t until three days later that Laban discovered Jacob had left.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Laban, along with some of his relatives, took off in pursuit and chased after Jacob for seven days. He had almost caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead,</verse>
				<verse number="24">when God appeared to Laban the Aramean in a dream and warned him, “Be careful that you neither harm nor threaten Jacob.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now Jacob had set up his camp with his flocks on a hill, and Laban had him in his sights. Laban and his companions set up their camp nearby.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Laban approached Jacob and said, “ Nephew, what have you done? You’ve deceived me and carried away my daughters like captives on a battlefield.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Why did you trick me and run away in secret without telling me? I would have sent you off joyously, celebrating with singing and dancing to the tambourine and stringed instruments.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And why did you not even let me kiss my daughters and grandchildren goodbye? What you have done is foolish!</verse>
				<verse number="29">I could harm you, but the God of your father spoke to me in a dream last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you neither harm nor threaten Jacob.’</verse>
				<verse number="30">Now I realize you ran away because you desperately long to return to your father’s house, but why did you steal my gods?”</verse>
				<verse number="31">“ I left in a hurry because I was afraid,” Jacob answered, “and I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Whoever has taken your gods will be put to death! So here, in the presence of our relatives, if you can find among our possessions anything that is yours, take it.” Now Jacob had no clue that Rachel had stolen the gods.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Laban went immediately into Jacob’s tent to search. Then he went into the tents of Zilpah and Bilhah but found nothing. After searching Leah’s tent, he went into Rachel’s.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Now Rachel had taken the family gods and put them in her camel’s cushion and sat on them.</verse>
				<verse number="35">She said to her father, “Please my father, don’t be angry if I don’t rise before you, for I’m having my period.” When he rummaged through her tent, he did not find them.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then Jacob became angry and complained to Laban, “What have I done wrong? What sin have I committed that you would hotly pursue me as if you were chasing a criminal?</verse>
				<verse number="37">You have rummaged through all my things, and did you find anything of your own property? If you did, set them here in front of your relatives and mine. Let them decide between the two of us.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Jacob continued, “For the last twenty years I have served you, and the whole time your sheep and goats did not miscarry, nor did I feast on any of your rams.</verse>
				<verse number="39">If one from your flock was mauled by a wild beast, I didn’t bring it to you; I absorbed the loss myself. And you always made me pay for any missing animal, whether snatched by day or by night.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Many times, scorching heat consumed me by day and hard frost by night; I endured sleepless nights.</verse>
				<verse number="41">For these twenty years that I’ve lived among you, I slaved away fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flocks. And besides all that, you’ve reduced my wages over and over.</verse>
				<verse number="42">If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Awesome One of Isaac, had not been on my side, you certainly would have sent me away empty-handed! But God in his mercy took notice of how much I’ve suffered and how hard I’ve worked—and that’s why he rebuked you last night in your dream!”</verse>
				<verse number="43">Laban replied to Jacob, “These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren; and the flocks are mine. In fact, everything you see belongs to me. But from today I will not be able to do anything more for my daughters and grandchildren.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Come now, let’s form a covenant between you and me. Let it endure as a witness between us.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">So Jacob took a stone, set it up as a pillar,</verse>
				<verse number="46">and in the presence of his relatives, he said to them, “Everyone gather stones, and place them here in a pile.” And they did so, and afterward, they ate together next to the heap of stones.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Laban and Jacob named the place in both languages, Aramaic and Hebrew, calling it Witness Heap.</verse>
				<verse number="48">And Laban said, “Today, this heap of stones will be a witness between you and me of our enduring friendship.” He called it Witness Heap</verse>
				<verse number="49">and Watchpost, for Laban declared, “May Yahweh keep his eyes on us when we are absent from each other.</verse>
				<verse number="50">If you mistreat my daughters or marry other women besides my daughters, remember that even though no one else is with us, God is watching us.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Here is the heap of stones and here is the memorial pillar that stands between us.</verse>
				<verse number="52">This heap and this pillar stand as witnesses that I will never pass beyond them to harm you and that you will never pass beyond them to harm me.</verse>
				<verse number="53">Now may the God of Abraham and the god of Nahor judge between us!” Jacob made his vow by the Awesome One of his father Isaac.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called everyone together for a meal, and they remained there all night on the mountain.</verse>
				<verse number="55">Early the next morning, Laban kissed his daughters and grandchildren, blessed them, and then he returned home.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="32">
				<verse number="1">As Jacob continued toward Canaan, the angels of God came to meet him!</verse>
				<verse number="2">When he saw them, he exclaimed, “This is God’s military camp!” So he named that place Two Camps of Angels.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau who was living in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He instructed them, “Give this message from me to my master Esau, ‘I am your servant. I have lived with our uncle Laban all these years</verse>
				<verse number="5">and have acquired sheep, cattle, donkeys, and both male and female servants. I send this message to you, my master, in the hope of finding favor in your eyes.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">When the messengers returned to Jacob, they informed him, “We gave your brother Esau your message, and he himself is coming here to meet you. In fact, he’s on his way now with four hundred men!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Gripped with fear to the point of panic, Jacob split all the people who were with him into two camps, and also the flocks, herds, and camels.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He said to himself, “If Esau attacks the first camp and destroys them, at least the other camp will escape.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Jacob prayed, “ Yahweh, God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, you said to me, ‘Return to your country and to your family, and I will make you prosper.’</verse>
				<verse number="10">I am so unworthy of all the loving-kindness and faithfulness that you have showered upon me, your servant. When I crossed this river Jordan years ago, all I had to my name was a staff in my hand, and now I have increased to become two camps!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I’m afraid he will come and kill all of us, including the women and children.</verse>
				<verse number="12">You said to me, ‘I will certainly prosper you and make your offspring as innumerable as the sand of the sea.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So he spent the night there. From what he had with him, Jacob sent a gift to his brother Esau:</verse>
				<verse number="14">two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</verse>
				<verse number="15">thirty female camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He placed them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself. He told them, “Go on ahead of me, and put some space between each herd.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">He gave these instructions to the one in the lead, “When my brother Esau meets you, and asks, ‘Who is your master? Where are you going? Who owns these herds you are driving?’</verse>
				<verse number="18">then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. He’s sent them as a gift to you, my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="19">He likewise instructed the leaders of the second and the third herds and all those following them, “You must say the same thing when you meet Esau.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And be sure to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us,’ ” because he reasoned, “If I can appease Esau with these gifts before I have to meet him face-to-face, he may accept me.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">So he sent the gifts on ahead of him, while he spent that night in the camp.</verse>
				<verse number="22">During the night, Jacob arose, woke up his two wives, his two maidservants, and eleven sons, and had them cross the ford of the Jabbok River.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He sent them across along with everything he had,</verse>
				<verse number="24">and Jacob was left all alone. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a man appeared and wrestled with him until daybreak.</verse>
				<verse number="25">When the man saw that he was not winning the match, he struck Jacob’s hip and knocked it out of joint, leaving it wrenched as he continued to wrestle with him.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Eventually, the man said to him, “Let me go, for the day is breaking.” But Jacob refused. “No! Not until you bless me!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">“What is your name?” asked the man. “Jacob,” he replied.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Not anymore,” the man said to him. “Your new name is Israel, for you have struggled both with God and with people and have overcome.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jacob said, “Please, tell me your name.” “Why ask my name?” the man replied, then he spoke a blessing over Jacob.</verse>
				<verse number="30">So Jacob named the place Penuel, saying, “I have seen God face-to-face, yet my life has been spared!”</verse>
				<verse number="31">The sun rose upon him as he crossed the Jabbok River from Penuel, limping because of his hip.</verse>
				<verse number="32">To this day, the Israelites do not eat the thigh muscle attached to the hip socket, because the man struck Jacob’s hip socket at the thigh muscle.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="33">
				<verse number="1">When Jacob looked up, he saw Esau approaching with four hundred men. So he quickly divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He lined up the maidservants and their children in front, then Leah and her children, then Rachel and Joseph last of all.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Jacob went ahead of them to face Esau. As he approached his brother, he bowed down to the ground seven times before reaching him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But Esau ran to Jacob and hugged him! He threw his arms around Jacob’s neck, he kissed him, and they wept in each other’s arms.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, he said to Jacob, “Who are all these coming behind you?” Jacob replied, “These are the children, your niece and nephews, whom God has so graciously given your servant.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then the maidservants came forward with their children and bowed low before Esau.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Leah likewise came forward with her children and bowed down. Finally, Rachel and Joseph came forward and they bowed down to the ground before Esau.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Esau asked Jacob, “Why did you send all these animals to me?” “I was hoping to find favor with you, my lord,” Jacob replied.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“But my brother,” Esau laughed, “I have plenty. Keep what you have for yourself.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jacob replied, “No, please. If I have found favor in your eyes, please take the gifts. For truly, seeing your face after all these years, it’s like looking upon the face of God! Since you have received me so warmly,</verse>
				<verse number="11">please accept the blessing I have brought to you, for God has poured his grace over me, and I have everything I want!” So with these words Jacob urged him, and Esau accepted the gifts.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Esau said, “Let’s start out on our journey, and I’ll walk alongside you.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">But Jacob replied, “My lord, you can see how tired the children are, and all our flocks and herds are nursing their young. If we drive them too hard for even a day, they will die.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Please, my lord, go ahead of your servant. Let me move along slowly with my flocks and herds, to give them a chance to graze. I must think of my children, too, so go ahead of me, my lord, until I catch up with you in Seir.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Esau said, “Well, at least let me leave you with some of my men.” “You’re so kind,” Jacob replied, “but there’s no need to do so.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So that very day Esau and his men left to return to Seir,</verse>
				<verse number="17">but Jacob went the opposite direction to Succoth instead, and built himself a house there. He also built shelters for his livestock, and that is why Jacob named the place Succoth.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Jacob’s journey home from Paddan-Aram finally brought him safe and sound to the Canaanite city of Shechem, where he camped just outside of the city.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He purchased the field where he pitched his tent from the clan of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of silver.</verse>
				<verse number="20">There he set up an altar and named it To the True God, the God of Israel.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="34">
				<verse number="1">One day, Jacob and Leah’s daughter, Dinah, went out to visit the neighborhood girls.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now Hamor, the tribal chief of the Hivites, had a son named Shechem, who was the prince. When he saw how attractive Dinah was, he seized her and sexually assaulted her.</verse>
				<verse number="3">His heart was drawn to Dinah, Jacob’s daughter, so he sought to win her affection and spoke tenderly to her.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Shechem went to his father Hamor and said, “Get me this girl to be my wife.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now Jacob heard that Shechem had violated his daughter Dinah; but his sons were in the fields with his livestock, so he waited to act until his sons returned home.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Shechem’s father Hamor brought his son to speak with Jacob about marriage arrangements.</verse>
				<verse number="7">During their conversation, Jacob’s sons came in from the field, and they heard the report of what Shechem had done to their sister Dinah. They were shocked and furious over the shameful act Shechem committed against Israel —a criminal act of sexual assault that never should have happened.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But Hamor tried to defuse the situation, saying, “Listen, my son Shechem is in love with your daughter. Please, give her to him in marriage.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Let’s allow our people to intermarry. Let your daughters marry our sons, and we will let our daughters marry your sons.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You may settle here among us, live anywhere you wish, move about freely, and acquire property.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then Shechem spoke up and said to Dinah’s family, “Please, let me find favor in your eyes. Whatever you require of me, I’ll pay.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Set the bride-price as high as you wish, no matter how expensive it is; I’ll pay whatever you ask. Only give me the young woman to be my wife.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">The sons of Jacob concocted a devious plan. Because of the rape of their sister Dinah, they answered Shechem and Hamor deceitfully,</verse>
				<verse number="14">saying, “Our culture will not allow us to consent to our sister Dinah marrying someone who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.</verse>
				<verse number="15">We would only approve of the marriage on one condition: you must circumcise every male among you and become as we are.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then we will allow our daughters to marry your sons and your daughters to marry our sons. And we will live among you and become one people.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But if you refuse to be circumcised, then we will take our sister and be gone.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">The offer pleased Hamor and his son Shechem.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And the young man lost no time in doing what they asked, because Shechem really wanted to marry Jacob’s daughter! Now Shechem was the most honored in all his family,</verse>
				<verse number="20">so Hamor and his son went to the gate of the city and spoke to the men, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="21">“These people are our friends. Let them settle in our land and make themselves at home; there’s plenty of room in the country for them. And, let’s agree to exchange our daughters in marriage to them and to unite us as one people.</verse>
				<verse number="22">They only have one condition in order to live among us and to unite with us as one people: every male among us must be circumcised as they are circumcised.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Won’t all of their livestock and property become ours? Let us agree to their request, so they will live among us.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">So all the townsmen agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male of the city was circumcised.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Three days later, while all the men were still suffering in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city. They slaughtered every male of the city.</verse>
				<verse number="26">They even killed Hamor and his son Shechem, and took Dinah from Shechem’s house, and left.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Later, Jacob’s other sons came upon the dead bodies, and they looted the city as retribution for the violation of their sister.</verse>
				<verse number="28">They seized the flocks, herds, and donkeys, and all that was in the city and in the field.</verse>
				<verse number="29">They plundered all their wealth and their household goods and took their wives and children as captives.</verse>
				<verse number="30">When Jacob found out, he said to Simeon and Levi, “ What have you done? You have ruined my name, and now the Canaanites and Perizzites and all the people of this land will hate me! My men are so few that if they unite against me and attack, I and all my household will be destroyed!”</verse>
				<verse number="31">But they answered him, “Why should they treat our sister like a whore?”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="35">
				<verse number="1">God said to Jacob, “Arise, go at once to Bethel, and settle there. Build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of every foreign god you have, purify yourselves, and change your clothes.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then come with me; let us go up to Bethel. I will build an altar there to God who answered my prayer when I was in distress and whose presence has been with me wherever I have gone.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then they surrendered all the foreign gods they had as well as their earrings. Jacob buried them under the oak tree near Shechem.</verse>
				<verse number="5">As they made their way to Bethel, a tremendous fear of God fell upon all the cities around them, and no one dared pursue them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jacob and all the people who were with him arrived in the land of Canaan at Luz, now known as Bethel.</verse>
				<verse number="7">He built an altar there and named it El-Bethel, because it was the place that God had unveiled himself when Jacob was running from his brother.</verse>
				<verse number="8">During that time, Rebekah’s nurse Deborah died. They buried her under an oak tree near Bethel, and they named the place Weeping Oak.</verse>
				<verse number="9">After Jacob returned from Paddan-Aram, God appeared to him once again and blessed him,</verse>
				<verse number="10">saying, “Your name was once Jacob, but no longer. Your new name is Israel!” God named him Israel</verse>
				<verse number="11">and said to him, “I am the God who is more than enough. Go and have many children, and they will multiply. A nation and a gathering of many nations will come from you; and you will be the ancestor of kings.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will give you the land which I gave to Abraham and to Isaac, and after you are gone, to your descendants.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then God ascended into heaven from the place where he had spoken to him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Jacob set up a stone pillar to memorialize the place where he had met with God. He poured over it a drink offering and anointed the pillar with oil.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.</verse>
				<verse number="16">From Bethel, they journeyed on, and as they were approaching Ephrath, Rachel went into very hard and painful labor.</verse>
				<verse number="17">As she was having great difficulty in giving birth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you’re having another son!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">With her dying breath, Rachel said, “His name is Son of My Sorrow,” but his father called him Son of My Right Hand.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Rachel died and was buried on the road to Ephrath (now Bethlehem).</verse>
				<verse number="20">Jacob set up a pillar to mark her burial site, and it is known as The Marker of Rachel’s Tomb to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.</verse>
				<verse number="22">While Israel was living in that land, Reuben went and slept with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Israel found out. Jacob had twelve sons.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Leah’s sons were Reuben (Jacob’s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Rachel’s sons were Joseph and Benjamin.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The sons of Rachel’s maidservant Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The sons of Leah’s maidservant Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob born to him in Paddan-Aram.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had lived as foreigners.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Isaac was one hundred and eighty when he breathed his last and died.</verse>
				<verse number="29">He died an old man and had lived a full life when he joined his ancestors. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him there.</verse>

			<chapter number="36">
				<verse number="1">Here are the descendants of Esau, also known as Edom:</verse>
				<verse number="2">Esau chose three wives from among Canaanite women: Adah (daughter of Elon the Hittite), Oholibamah (daughter of Anah son of Zibeon the Hivite), and Basemath (Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth).</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau; Basemath bore Reuel;</verse>
				<verse number="5">and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons who were born to Esau in the land of Canaan.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and his entire household, and the cattle, livestock, and possessions he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and migrated to the land of Seir some distance from his brother Jacob.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Since the land where Jacob was living could not support their combined possessions and livestock,</verse>
				<verse number="8">Esau (also known as Edom), settled in the hill country of Seir.</verse>
				<verse number="9">This is the account of Esau, ancestor of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir:</verse>
				<verse number="10">Esau’s wife Adah bore him one son Eliphaz, and Eliphaz had five sons: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. Eliphaz also had a son with his concubine Timna, named Amelek. Esau’s wife Basemath bore him one son Reuel, and Reuel had four sons: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.</verse>
				<verse number="11"></verse>
				<verse number="12"></verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon, bore Esau three sons: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.</verse>
				<verse number="15">These are the tribes descended from Esau’s firstborn son Eliphaz whom Adah bore, and who lived in Edom: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, Korah, Gatam, and Amalek.</verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">These are the tribes descended from Esau and Basemath’s son Reuel, who lived in Edom: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.</verse>
				<verse number="18">These are the tribes descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.</verse>
				<verse number="19">This concludes the list of the descendants of Esau (also known as Edom) and their respective tribes.</verse>
				<verse number="20">These are the tribes descended from Seir the Horite, of the original inhabitants of Edom: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. All of these were the descendants of Seir.</verse>
				<verse number="21"></verse>
				<verse number="22">Lotan’s sons were Hori and Heman, and Lotan’s sister was Timna.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Shobal’s sons were Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Zibeon’s sons were Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who discovered the springs in the wilderness while he was grazing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Anah’s son was Dishon, and Anah’s daughter was Oholibamah.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Dishon’s sons were Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Keran.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Ezer’s sons were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Dishan’s sons were Uz and Aran.</verse>
				<verse number="29">This concludes the list of the Horite tribes in the land of Seir: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan.</verse>
				<verse number="30"></verse>
				<verse number="31">Long before the Israelites had kings, there were eight kings who reigned in Edom,</verse>
				<verse number="32">beginning with Bela son of Beor from the city of Dinhabah.</verse>
				<verse number="33">When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from the city of Bozrah succeeded.</verse>
				<verse number="34">When Jobab died, Husham from the land of Teman succeeded him.</verse>
				<verse number="35">When Husham died, Hadad from the city of Avith, who was the son of Bedad, succeeded him. Hadad defeated the Midianites in the land of Moab.</verse>
				<verse number="36">When Hadad died, Samlah of Masrekah succeeded him.</verse>
				<verse number="37">When Samlah died, Shaul of Rehoboth-on-the-River succeeded him.</verse>
				<verse number="38">When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan son of Achbor succeeded him.</verse>
				<verse number="39">When Baal-Hanan son of Achbor died, Hadar from the city of Pau succeeded him. (His wife was Mehetabel the daughter of Matred, Me-Zahab’s granddaughter.)</verse>
				<verse number="40">These are the tribes of Esau according to their clans and regions: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,</verse>
				<verse number="41"></verse>

				<verse number="43">Magdiel, and Iram. This concludes the list of the Edomite tribes who settled and possessed land in different regions of their country. All the Edomites descended from Esau.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="37">
				<verse number="1">This is the story of the family of Jacob, who had settled in the land of Canaan, where his father Isaac had lived as an immigrant. Jacob’s son Joseph was seventeen, and he served his older half brothers, the sons of his father’s wives Bilhah and Zilpah, helping them watch over the flocks. One day Joseph went to his father with a bad report about their behavior.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">Now Israel’s love for Joseph surpassed that for his other sons because he was born to him in his old age. So Israel had made him a richly ornamented robe.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father loved him more than he loved them, they hated him and would not speak a kind word to him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">One night Joseph had a dream, and when he shared it with his brothers, they hated him even more!</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Listen to this dream I had,” he told them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“There we were, binding sheaves of grain in the field. Suddenly, my sheaf rose up and stood upright. Then your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to mine!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">His brothers asked him, “Oh, so you think you’re going to be our king? Do you actually think you’re destined to rule over us?” So, the dream that he told them about made them hate him even more.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then another night he had a dream, and he shared it with his brothers, saying, “Listen, I had another dream. This time, the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">When his father and brothers heard it, his father scolded him, “What kind of dream is that? Do you really think that I, and your mother, and your brothers are going to come and bow to the ground before you?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So his brothers grew more jealous of him, but his father kept pondering Joseph’s dream.</verse>
				<verse number="12">One day, when his brothers had gone to Shechem to care for their father’s flock,</verse>
				<verse number="13">Israel called for Joseph and said to him, “Your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. I want you to go join them.” “ Yes, Father, I’ll go.” Joseph replied.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Jacob added, “Go find out how your brothers are doing with the flocks and bring word back to me.” So, his father sent him off from the valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem</verse>
				<verse number="15">and began to roam the countryside looking for his brothers, a man approached him and asked, “What are you looking for?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">“I’m looking for my brothers, who are taking care of their flock,” he answered. “Please tell me, do you know where they are?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">The man replied, “They’ve left here already. I overheard them mention that they were going to Dothan.” So, Joseph took off to catch up with his brothers and found them at Dothan.</verse>
				<verse number="18">As he was still a long distance away, the brothers recognized him by his robe, and by the time he reached them, they had plotted together to kill him.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They said to each other, “Here comes this dream expert.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Let’s kill him and throw his body into one of these dry wells. We can say that a wild animal ate him. Then we’ll see how his dreams turn out!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">When Reuben heard of this, he tried to save Joseph’s life. “Don’t take his life,” he said.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“No bloodshed! Let’s throw him into this pit in the middle of nowhere, but don’t hurt him.” Reuben said these things because he planned to return later to rescue Joseph and take him back to his father.</verse>
				<verse number="23">When Joseph finally caught up with his brothers, they seized him, stripped him of his ornamented robe, his beautiful full-length robe,</verse>
				<verse number="24">and threw him into the dry, empty pit.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Afterward, the brothers sat down to eat their food. When they looked up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelite merchants coming from Gilead on their way to Egypt. They had many camels loaded with myrrh, spices, and perfumes.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Judah spoke up and said to his brothers, “What will we gain by murdering our brother and covering up his blood?</verse>
				<verse number="27">I have an idea! Let’s sell Joseph to these Ishmaelites and not lay a hand on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.” His brothers agreed.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And when the Midianites (also known as Ishmaelites) came by, Joseph’s brothers lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver, and the merchants took Joseph far away to Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Later, Reuben went to the pit, and saw that Joseph was gone. He was overcome with grief and tore his clothes.</verse>
				<verse number="30">He went to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do now?”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then they took Joseph’s colorful robe, killed a goat, and dipped the robe in its blood.</verse>
				<verse number="32">They took the blood-stained robe back to their father and said, “We found this. Look it over—doesn’t it belong to your son?”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Jacob recognized it instantly and cried out, “It’s my son’s robe! Some wild animal must have killed him. My son Joseph has been torn to pieces!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Overcome with grief, Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned for his son a long time.</verse>
				<verse number="35">All his sons and daughters came and tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He told them, “No, I will mourn for him the rest of my life, until I join my son in the realm of the dead.” Joseph’s father wept and wept for his son.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Meanwhile, the Midianites took Joseph to Egypt and sold him to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="38">
				<verse number="1">Around that time, Judah left his brothers at Hebron and went to Adullam to stay with a man named Hirah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">There he met and married a Canaanite girl, the daughter of Shua. He slept with her and</verse>
				<verse number="3">she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and Judah named him Er.</verse>
				<verse number="4">She conceived again and gave birth to another son and named him Onan.</verse>
				<verse number="5">While they were staying in Chezib, she gave birth to a third son and named him Shelah.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When their sons were grown, Judah arranged for Er, his oldest son, to marry a girl named Tamar.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But Er had become so wicked in the sight of Yahweh that Yahweh ended his life.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then Judah said to Er’s brother Onan, “Your duty is to join yourself to her. Go perform your duty as a brother-in-law and provide an heir for your brother.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Onan, however, did not want to produce a child that would not be his own rightful heir, so whenever he and Tamar had intercourse, he purposely spilled his semen onto the ground to keep her from getting pregnant and having a child that would belong to his dead brother.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But what he did was wicked in Yahweh ’s sight, so he took Onan’s life also.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Live as a widow in your father’s house until my youngest son Shelah grows up.” So Tamar went home to her parents, but Judah worried that Shelah would end up dead like his brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="12">After some time passed, Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When his time of mourning was over, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went to Timnah to enjoy the festivities at the sheep-shearing.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Meanwhile, Tamar had learned that Shelah had grown up, but Judah had still not given him to her to father a child for her deceased husband. So, when Tamar found out her father-in-law was coming to Timnah for the sheep-shearing, she removed her widow’s clothes and covered herself with a veil to disguise herself. And she sat waiting at the crossroads where Judah would have to pass by.</verse>
				<verse number="14"></verse>
				<verse number="15">When Judah saw her, she was wearing a veil over her face, so he thought she was a prostitute. He had no clue that she was his own daughter-in-law. So he approached her and said, “Come sleep with me.” “What will you give me if I do?” she answered.</verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">He responded, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” “What guarantee can you give me that you will really send it?” she asked.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Well, what pledge do you want?” Judah asked. Tamar answered, “Give me your necklace with your personal signet and the staff you’re holding.” So, he gave them to her, and he went and slept with her. When she got up and went home, she removed her veil and put her widow’s garment back on. Later, she discovered she was pregnant.</verse>
				<verse number="19"></verse>
				<verse number="20">Soon afterward, Judah sent the young goat by his friend Hirah the Adullamite to recover his items from the prostitute, but she was nowhere to be found.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So he asked the townspeople, “Where is the temple prostitute that sits by the crossroads?” They answered, “No prostitute has been there.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">So he returned to Judah and informed him, “I couldn’t find her, and besides that, the townspeople said that no prostitute has been there.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Judah replied, “Let her keep my pledge. If we try to go get it now, we’ll become a laughingstock. After all, I did send you with the payment I promised her, and you couldn’t find her.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">About three months later, Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has been promiscuous, and now she is pregnant!” Indignant, Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, “Look, the one who owns these things got me pregnant! See, whose signet and staff are these?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Judah recognized them as his and said, “She is more righteous than I, for I never gave my son Shelah to marry her.” And he let her go free and never slept with her again.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When it was time for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb!</verse>
				<verse number="28">While she was in labor, one hand popped out, so the midwife wrapped a crimson thread around its wrist, saying, “This one came out first.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">But immediately, he drew his hand back, and out came his brother; and she said, “Look how you have broken out of the womb!” So, he was named Perez, the one who breaks through.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Afterward, his brother came out, the one with the crimson thread on his wrist. That’s why they named him Zerah (“ the crimson one ”).</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="39">
				<verse number="1">After the Ishmaelite traders brought Joseph down to Egypt, he was purchased by an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, whose name was Potiphar.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh ’s presence was with Joseph and he became successful while living in the house of his Egyptian master.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When his master realized that Yahweh ’s presence was with Joseph and caused everything he did to prosper,</verse>
				<verse number="4">Joseph found favor with Potiphar. He was quickly promoted to become the overseer of Potiphar’s house and was put in charge of all that he had.</verse>
				<verse number="5">From the moment Potiphar appointed Joseph over his household, Yahweh blessed the Egyptian’s affairs for Joseph’s sake. The blessing of Yahweh was upon everything Potiphar owned; his finances increased, his crops flourished, and his flocks and herds multiplied.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So Potiphar placed all that he owned under Joseph’s oversight. And with Joseph in charge, Potiphar had nothing to worry about, except deciding on what to eat! Now Joseph was strikingly handsome, very good-looking, and well-built.</verse>
				<verse number="7">It wasn’t long before his master’s wife noticed Joseph. She demanded: “Come make love to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Never!” Joseph replied. “Don’t you realize that my master has nothing to worry about with me in charge, for he has put everything he has under my care?</verse>
				<verse number="9">There is no one greater in his household than me, nor has he kept anything back from me except you, because you’re his wife. Why would I want to do such an immoral thing and sin against God?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yet day after day, she was determined to seduce him. But Joseph continually refused her advances and would not even go near her.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then one day, when he had to go into the house to do his work and no one else was there,</verse>
				<verse number="12">she grabbed him by his robe and said, “Come on, sleep with me!” But he abruptly ran out of the house, leaving his robe in her hands!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Realizing he had fled, and she was holding his robe in her hands,</verse>
				<verse number="14">she called for her household servants and said to them, “See! My husband brings this Hebrew foreigner here to make fools of us! He barged into my house and tried to have sex with me, and I screamed;</verse>
				<verse number="15">and when he heard me scream for help, he ran out of the house and left his robe!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">She kept the robe beside her until his master came home</verse>
				<verse number="17">and she told him the same story: “This Hebrew foreigner you brought among us barged into the house and tried to violate me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">As soon as I screamed out for help, he ran outside and left his robe here beside me.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">When his master heard his wife’s account about how his servant had treated her, he became furious.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So Joseph’s master took him and threw him into prison, the place where the king’s prisoners are confined, and he was left there.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But Yahweh was with Joseph and demonstrated to him his faithful love by giving him great favor in the sight of the warden.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The warden put all the prisoners under Joseph’s care; he was placed in charge of all the prisoners and everything in the prison.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The warden had no worries about the prison with Joseph in charge, because Yahweh ’s presence was with Joseph and caused everything Joseph did to prosper.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="40">
				<verse number="1">Some time later, both Pharaoh’s chief steward and chief baker deeply offended their master, the king of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief steward and the chief baker,</verse>
				<verse number="3">so he incarcerated them in the palace of Potiphar, the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was bound.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The captain of the guard placed them under Joseph’s charge, and they remained in custody for some time.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then one night, they both dreamed—the steward and the baker, officials of the king of Egypt. They each had a prophetic dream with different interpretations.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw they looked miserable,</verse>
				<verse number="7">so he asked Pharaoh’s two officials who were under his custody, “ What’s wrong? Why the sad faces?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">“We had dreams last night,” they answered, “and we have no one to interpret them.” And Joseph said to them, “God can interpret your dreams! Please, tell them to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">So the chief steward shared his dream with Joseph first. He said, “In my dream, I saw a vine with three branches in front of me. I watched as it budded, then immediately it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">I was holding Pharaoh’s cup, so I took the grapes, squeezed them into his cup, and handed the cup to the king.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Joseph said to him, “ God has given me the interpretation of your dream: The three branches are three days.</verse>
				<verse number="13">In three days, Pharaoh will pardon you and restore you to your post. You will once again hand Pharaoh’s cup to him as you used to do as his steward.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When things start to go well for you, remember me, and please be kind and mention me to Pharaoh so that he might release me from here.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and I have done nothing here to deserve being thrown into this dungeon.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">When the chief baker saw how favorably Joseph interpreted the dream, he said to him, “ Let me tell you my dream. I saw three wicker breadbaskets stacked on my head one above the other.</verse>
				<verse number="17">In the top basket, I saw all kinds of bread and pastries for Pharaoh to enjoy, but the birds came and ate out of the basket above my head.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Joseph said, “ God has given me the interpretation of your dream: The three baskets are three days.</verse>
				<verse number="19">In three days, Pharaoh will behead you and impale you on a pole, and birds will eat the flesh off your corpse.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Three days later, it was Pharaoh’s birthday, and he threw a huge feast for all his household. He singled out among his servants the chief steward and the chief baker.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He pardoned the chief steward and restored him to his post, and the steward handed Pharaoh his drink.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But he had the chief baker beheaded and impaled on a pole. So, Joseph had accurately interpreted both their dreams,</verse>
				<verse number="23">but the chief steward completely forgot about Joseph and never remembered him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="41">
				<verse number="1">After two full years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,</verse>
				<verse number="2">and up from the river emerged seven healthy, fat cows, and they began grazing in the marshland.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then he saw seven other cows come up out of the Nile right behind them. They were ugly and thin, and they stood beside the fat cows on the riverbank.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The seven ugly, thin cows ate up the seven healthy, fat cows. After Pharaoh’s dream he awoke</verse>
				<verse number="5">and fell back to sleep. He dreamed a second time. In his dream, he saw seven ears of grain, plump, ripe, and growing on a single stalk.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Close behind them sprouted seven ears of grain, thin and shriveled by the east wind.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And the seven thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke from his vivid and disturbing dream!</verse>
				<verse number="8">The next morning, his spirit was agitated, so he called for all the magicians and wise men in Egypt. Pharaoh recounted his dreams to them, but no one could give him the interpretation.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When the chief steward heard about the dreams he remembered Joseph and said to Pharaoh, “ Please, your dream reminds me today of my failures.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Once, when Pharaoh was angry with his servants, he incarcerated me and the chief baker in the prison of Potiphar, the captain of the guard.</verse>
				<verse number="11">We both had dreams on the same night but with different meanings.</verse>
				<verse number="12">There was a young Hebrew man imprisoned with us who had been the personal servant to the captain of the guard. And when we told him our dreams, he interpreted them and told each of us their meaning.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And it happened just as he said. Pharaoh restored me to my post, but he had the baker impaled.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">After hearing this, Pharaoh immediately sent for Joseph. They rushed him out of the dungeon to prepare him to meet with the king. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came and stood before Pharaoh.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had two dreams that no one can explain. I have heard that you are able to interpret a dream the moment you hear it.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">“I cannot do it alone,” Joseph replied, “but God will help me to give Pharaoh the proper interpretation for Pharaoh’s welfare.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then Pharaoh told Joseph, “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,</verse>
				<verse number="18">and up from the river emerged seven healthy, fat cows, and they began to graze in the marshland.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Right behind them followed seven other scrawny and emaciated cows. Never have I seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt!</verse>
				<verse number="20">The seven ugly, scrawny cows ate up the healthy, fat cows,</verse>
				<verse number="21">but after consuming them, no one could tell that they had eaten them, for they looked just as bad as before. I awoke with a start,</verse>
				<verse number="22">but immediately went back to sleep and had another dream. I saw seven ears of grain, full and ripe, growing on a single stalk.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Right behind them sprouted seven thin, shriveled ears, scorched by the east wind.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The seven shriveled ears swallowed up the seven healthy ears. I have shared my dreams with my magicians, but no one can give me an interpretation.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Both your dreams tell the same story, for God has prophetically told Pharaoh what he is about to do.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Both the seven healthy cows and the seven healthy ears represent seven good years; it’s the same dream.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The seven ugly and scrawny cows that followed and the seven shriveled ears scorched by the east wind are seven years also. They represent seven years of famine.</verse>
				<verse number="28">It is just as I have told Pharaoh; God has divinely revealed what he is about to do.</verse>
				<verse number="29">There will come seven years of great abundance throughout all the land of Egypt,</verse>
				<verse number="30">followed by seven years of intense famine. All of Egypt will forget the former abundance, for all the land will be ravaged by a famine, a very severe famine. They will not even remember their former abundance.</verse>
				<verse number="31"></verse>
				<verse number="32">The reason that Pharaoh’s dream was repeated is that God has determined that it will surely happen, and that he will soon carry it out.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Joseph continued, “Let Pharaoh select a very wise and discerning man and set him over the land of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Let Pharaoh appoint other officials throughout the land to collect one-fifth of all the crops each year during the seven plentiful years.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Have them gather all the food of these abundant years that are coming, and under Pharaoh’s authority, have the grain stored in the cities for food.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Store it all as food reserve for the people during the seven years of famine coming upon Egypt, so that the land will survive the famine.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Joseph’s proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his advisers.</verse>
				<verse number="38">He said to them, “Where can we find anyone else like this one, for he has the Spirit of God in him!”</verse>
				<verse number="39">So Pharaoh turned to Joseph and said, “Since God has divinely revealed this to you, there is no one as wise and full of insight as you.</verse>
				<verse number="40">I hereby place you in charge of all my affairs, and all my people will obey your commands. Only I, the king, will be greater than you!</verse>
				<verse number="41">“Listen to me, Joseph,” Pharaoh continued. “I am placing you in charge of all of Egypt.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">Then he removed his signet ring, placed it on Joseph’s finger, and had him clothed with fine linen robes! He adorned him with a golden collar around his neck.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Pharaoh had him ride in the chariot reserved for the second-in-command and sent runners going before him, crying out, “Kneel!” In this way, Pharaoh placed Joseph over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh. No one in all of Egypt will lift a finger without your permission!”</verse>
				<verse number="45">Pharaoh gave Joseph a new name: Revealer of Secrets. He also arranged for him to marry the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of Heliopolis. Her name was Asenath. And Joseph took charge over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Leaving Pharaoh’s presence, Joseph traveled throughout the entire land of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="47">During the seven years of abundance, the land produced bumper crops.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Joseph supervised the gathering up of all the great stores of food of the seven years of abundance and strategically placed them in various walled cities near where the harvest was gathered.</verse>
				<verse number="49">He gathered such massive quantities of produce that he gave up trying to measure it all, for it was like counting the sand on the seashore.</verse>
				<verse number="50">Prior to the famine, Joseph and Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis, had two sons.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, saying, “God has made me forget all my troubles and my parental home.”</verse>
				<verse number="52">The second he named Ephraim, saying, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.”</verse>
				<verse number="53">Eventually, Egypt’s seven years of abundance came to an end.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Then began the seven years of famine, just as Joseph prophesied. Although there was a severe famine everywhere else, food was available throughout the land of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="55">When the Egyptians grew hungry, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh said to all his people, “Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you.”</verse>
				<verse number="56">As the famine worsened over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe everywhere.</verse>
				<verse number="57">So because of the severity of the worldwide famine, people from all over the world had to come and buy grain from Joseph.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="42">
				<verse number="1">When Jacob learned there was food in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you standing around here staring at each other?</verse>
				<verse number="2">I hear there is grain in Egypt; go there and buy some for us so we don’t all starve to death.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So Joseph’s ten half brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt,</verse>
				<verse number="4">but Jacob did not send Joseph’s full brother Benjamin with them, because he feared something might happen to him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So Israel’s sons were among those who went to Egypt to buy grain, for the famine in the land of Canaan was severe.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now Joseph was the governor of the land of Egypt, which meant he supervised the sale of grain to all the people. One day, Joseph’s ten brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces on the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="7">As soon as Joseph saw them, he realized that they were his brothers! But he pretended he didn’t know them and spoke to them harshly: “Where do you come from?” “From the land of Canaan,” they answered, “and we’re here to buy food.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they had no clue that it was Joseph speaking to them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then at once, Joseph remembered the dreams he had about them bowing down before him! Pausing, he said to them, “You are spies! You’ve come to see where our land is weak!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">His brothers replied, “No, master; we’ve come to buy food.</verse>
				<verse number="11">We, your servants, are honest men; we’d never think of spying! We’re blood brothers, sons of one father.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Joseph interrupted, “No! You are spies who have come here to find our weakness!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“We are your servants,” they insisted. “We were twelve brothers, our youngest brother remained behind with our father, and one brother—well, he is no more.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Joseph said to them, “It’s just as I said; you are spies!</verse>
				<verse number="15">And here is how I’ll test you: unless your younger brother comes and presents himself here before me, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you shall not depart from here!</verse>
				<verse number="16">One of you must go and bring me your brother, while the rest of you will remain here in confinement. This way I will test your words to see if the story you have told me is true. If not, as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">He placed them all in prison together for three days.</verse>
				<verse number="18">On the third day, Joseph said to them, “Do as I say and you will live. I am a man who respects God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">If you are as honest as you say you are, then I will keep just one of your brothers here in confinement while the rest of you carry grain home for your starving families.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You must return with your youngest brother so that I may verify your story, and that you may not die.” So they agreed to do so.</verse>
				<verse number="21">With Joseph standing there, they began to speak among themselves, saying, “ Look what’s happened to us! We’re being punished for what we did to Joseph long ago. We heard his cries of anguish and saw the agony of his soul when he begged us for mercy, but we turned a deaf ear. That’s why all this trouble has come upon us!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then Reuben spoke up, “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn’t listen! So now we’re paying the price for his murder!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">They had no clue that Joseph understood every word, for he had been speaking to them through an interpreter.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Deeply affected by what he heard, Joseph began to weep and hurriedly left their presence. After he had composed himself, he returned to them, and pointing to Simeon, said, “This one will remain here.” Then he had him tied and bound while they all watched.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Joseph then gave orders to have their bags filled with grain, to hide each man’s money back inside his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey home. After this was done for them,</verse>
				<verse number="26">they loaded their donkeys with the bags of grain and departed.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Later, they camped for the night, and as one of them opened his sack of grain to feed his donkey, he discovered that his money was there right on top of the grain!</verse>
				<verse number="28">He shouted to his brothers, “My money! Look, someone put my money back in my sack!” Troubled and trembling, they said to each other, “What in the world has God done to us?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">When they came to their father Jacob in Canaan, they told him the story of all that happened to them, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="30">“The governor of Egypt spoke harshly to us and accused us of being spies.</verse>
				<verse number="31">We told him, ‘We are not spies but honest men.</verse>
				<verse number="32">We’re twelve brothers, sons of our father. Our youngest remained with our father in the land of Canaan, and one is no more.’</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then the man, the governor of Egypt, demanded, ‘By this test, I will discern if you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers with me, take the grain you need for your families, and be on your way.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Return to me with your youngest brother, then I’ll know you are not spies, but men of integrity. Then I’ll release your brother back to you, and you’ll be free to trade in the land.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="35">As they each emptied their sacks of grain, each man found his money inside his sack! When they and their father saw their money returned to them, they were frightened.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Their father Jacob said to his sons, “You have taken away my children! First, Joseph is gone, and now, Simeon! And now, you want to take Benjamin from me! Everything is against me!”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Then Reuben said, “ Father, you may put my two sons to death if I fail to bring Benjamin back to you! Trust me—I will bring him back!”</verse>
				<verse number="38">But Jacob replied, “I can’t let my son Benjamin go with you. For his brother is dead, and of Rachel’s sons, he alone is left. If he were to meet with disaster on your journey, I would die of grief! You will send my white hair and broken heart sorrowing down to the grave!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="43">
				<verse number="1">Now the famine in the land continued to grow more severe.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When all the grain they had brought from Egypt was almost gone, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us more food.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">But Judah objected, “The Egyptian warned us repeatedly, ‘You will not see my face again, unless Benjamin is with you!’</verse>
				<verse number="4">We’ll only go if you’ll let our brother come with us.</verse>
				<verse number="5">If you insist he remains here, we won’t go, for the man solemnly told us, ‘You will not see my face again, unless your brother is with you!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Israel demanded, “Why did you make it so hard for me by telling the man you had another brother?”</verse>
				<verse number="7">They answered him, “The man interrogated us about ourselves and our family, saying, ‘Is your father still living? Do you have another brother?’ We had to answer his questions! We had no idea he would say, ‘You must bring your brother here to me.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then Judah spoke up and said to Israel, “Father, I promise to guarantee his safety with my life. You can hold me personally responsible if I don’t return with him. I’ll bear the blame before you for the rest of my life if I fail to bring him safely back to you! You have my promise. Entrust him to my care, and let us be on our way, so that we all don’t die of starvation—we and you and all our children—we will live and not die!</verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10">And besides, if we hadn’t delayed so long, we could have gone and returned twice by now!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">After considering their words, their father Israel said to them, “If that’s the way it has to be, then do this: Load your donkeys with the very best gifts you can find, choice products of the land, and offer them to the man. Take some balm and some honey, spices, and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Take double the money with you. Give him back the money that was returned in the top of your sacks, for it may have been a mistake.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Take your brother, too, and be off! Go back to the man at once.</verse>
				<verse number="14">May the God who is more than enough grant you mercy and favor before the man, so that he may send back both Simeon and Benjamin. As for me, if I suffer loss, then let it be so.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So the brothers set off for Egypt and took double the money, the many gifts, and Benjamin. Once they arrived, they presented themselves before Joseph.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When Joseph saw his brother Benjamin with them, he said to his chief servant, “Bring the men to my house and make them feel at home. Butcher an animal and prepare a meal, for these men are to dine with me at noon.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Joseph’s chief servant did as he was told and brought the men to Joseph’s house.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now the brothers were very apprehensive as they were being led inside, and said to each other, “He brought us here because of the money that was put back in our sacks the first time we came to Egypt! He’s looking for an opportunity to arrest us, turn us into his slaves, and take away our donkeys!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So they approached the chief servant and spoke to him at the entrance of the house.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“If you please, my lord,” they said, “we came here once before to buy food,</verse>
				<verse number="21">but on our way home, when we camped for the night and opened our sacks, we found each one’s money in the top of his bag. All our money was there in our bags! We know it must have been an oversight of some kind, and we have no clue who put it there, so we have brought it all back with us. Plus, we have additional money to buy more food.”</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23">“Relax,” he replied, “don’t be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, must have been the one who put treasure in your bags. I have received your money; it’s all accounted for.” Then the chief servant brought Simeon out to them.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then he gave feed to their donkeys and brought the brothers into the house. He gave them water to drink and washed their feet.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The men laid out their gifts to present to Joseph, for they were told he would appear before them at noon and would dine with them.</verse>
				<verse number="26">When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought with them into the house. They each bowed low before him with their faces to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="27">He asked them how the family was doing, saying, “You mentioned your aging father; is he still alive? Is he doing well?”</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Yes,” they replied, “our father, your servant, is still alive and doing well.” And they bowed low before Joseph in respect.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Looking them over, he saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said to them, “So, I see you have returned with your youngest brother, of whom you spoke. God be gracious to you, my son.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Joseph hastily left the room, for he was overwhelmed with feelings of love for his brother and on the verge of tears. He went into a private room and sobbed, as tears ran down his cheeks.</verse>
				<verse number="31">When he finally composed himself, he washed his face, reappeared, and ordered: “Serve the meal.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">First, they served Joseph who was seated apart from his brothers, then the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians by themselves. (It would have been utterly offensive for the Egyptians to eat at the same table with the Hebrews.)</verse>
				<verse number="33">Now, the brothers had been seated before Joseph in their birth order, from the firstborn at one end of the table to the youngest at the other end. They were all stunned when they realized the seating arrangement and looked at each other in astonishment.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Eleven plates of food were taken from Joseph’s table and set in front of each of them, but Benjamin’s portion was five times more than any of theirs! They feasted and drank their fill with Joseph until they all became drunk.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="44">
				<verse number="1">Joseph ordered his chief servant, “Fill the men’s sacks with grain, with as much as they can hold, and put each one’s money back in the mouth of his bag.</verse>
				<verse number="2">As for the youngest one, place my silver goblet in the mouth of his sack, along with the money he paid for his grain.” And he did as Joseph said.</verse>
				<verse number="3">At dawn, the men loaded their donkeys and set off for home.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They hadn’t gone far outside of the city when Joseph said to his chief servant, “Now, go at once and pursue the men! And when you catch up to them, say to them, ‘Why did you repay good with evil?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Why have you stolen the silver goblet from which my master drinks, and the one he uses to discover secrets hidden from men? You have done an evil thing!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">When the chief servant caught up with them, he repeated his master’s words to them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They answered him, “Why does my lord accuse us of such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything of the kind!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Didn’t we return from Canaan with the money we found in our grain sacks? Why then would we steal silver or gold from the house of your lord?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Look for yourself. If any of your servants is found to have it, then he will die, and the rest of us will become your master’s slaves!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Very well then,” Joseph’s servant replied, “as you have said. But I will show you leniency. The one who has it will be my slave, but the rest of you will go free.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Each one quickly lowered his bag to the ground and opened it.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then the chief servant searched each bag, beginning with oldest and ending with the youngest—and he found the silver goblet in Benjamin’s bag!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Aghast, the brothers ripped their clothes in despair. They all loaded their donkeys again and returned to the city.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Joseph was waiting in his house when Judah and his brothers arrived. When they saw Joseph, they all fell to the ground before him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Joseph said to them, “What have you done? Don’t you know that divination would have given insight to a man like me?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Judah replied, “What can we say, my lord? How can we plead our case? How can we prove our innocence? God has revealed the guilt of your servants, and here we are—our lord’s slaves, both we and the one in whose sack the silver goblet was found.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“No,” Joseph commanded. “Only the one who stole my silver goblet will be my slave; the rest of you will go on home in peace to your father.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Judah stepped forward and offered, “My lord, please, may I have a word with you? You are the equal of Pharaoh. Please don’t be angry with me, your servant.</verse>
				<verse number="19">My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or another brother?’</verse>
				<verse number="20">We answered my lord, ‘We have an aged father and our youngest brother, who is a child of his old age. The child’s full brother is dead, so now he is the only child left of his mother, and his father loves him very much.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him here to me so that I might see him myself.’</verse>
				<verse number="22">We said to my lord, ‘But he cannot leave his father; if he were to leave him, his father would die.’</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then you said to your servants, ‘You will not see my face again if I do not see your youngest brother.’</verse>
				<verse number="24">When we arrived home to your servant, my father, we told him every word you had spoken to us.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Sometime later, our father said to us, ‘Go back and buy some more food for us.’</verse>
				<verse number="26">We answered, ‘We can only return to Egypt if we take our youngest brother with us. We won’t see the man’s face again, if he doesn’t see our youngest brother.’</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then, your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You know that my wife Rachel only gave me two sons.</verse>
				<verse number="28">One is gone from me—torn by a beast! I haven’t seen him since.</verse>
				<verse number="29">If you take this one also from me, and something happens to him, you will send my gray hairs in grief down to the grave.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Judah continued, “ My lord, if I went to your servant, my father, without the boy, and he saw that the boy was not with us, he would die! His very life is wrapped up with the life of the boy. Now he is so old that the grief of his loss would kill him.</verse>
				<verse number="31"></verse>
				<verse number="32">Furthermore, I, your servant, have guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father. I told him, ‘If I don’t return the boy back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, for the rest of my life!’</verse>
				<verse number="33">“So, please let me take the place of the boy, and I will remain here as a slave to you, my lord. Please let the boy go back with his brothers. How could I return to my father without the boy? I don’t want to witness the woe and grief that would overtake my father.”</verse>
				<verse number="34"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="45">
				<verse number="1">Joseph could no longer contain his pent-up feelings, so he cried out to his attendants, “Leave the room!” So no one was there when Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He began to weep so loudly that the Egyptians heard it—even as far away as Pharaoh’s house!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Joseph, through his tears, said to his brothers in Hebrew: “I am Joseph! Is father still alive?” His brothers stood there stunned, scared, and speechless.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Joseph said to his brothers, “Please, come close to me.” Inching forward, they came close to him. Then Joseph said, “It’s me—your brother—whom you sold into slavery in Egypt. I am Joseph!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now don’t be grieved. Don’t blame yourselves because you sold me here. It was God who sent me ahead of you in order to save lives.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The famine has now endured for two years, and the land will not bear fruit for five more years.</verse>
				<verse number="7">God sent me ahead of you to ensure that you would live and have descendants. He has saved your lives through this marvelous act of deliverance.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So it was God, not you, who sent me here. God has made me a father to Pharaoh, the master of his entire household, and the ruler over all of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Hurry back to my father and tell him that you have found me alive. Tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says, “God has made me ruler of all Egypt. Come to me without delay.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You will settle in the land of Goshen, where you will be near me—you and all your children and your grandchildren, your flocks and herds and all that you possess.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For there will be five more years of famine, but I will provide all that you need to live in Goshen. You, your household, and all that you have will not live in poverty.” ’</verse>
				<verse number="12">“My brothers, you each can see for yourselves, and Benjamin can too, that I really am Joseph, for I’m speaking to you face-to-face in our own language.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You must tell father everything you have seen here and how greatly I am honored in Egypt. But hurry and bring my father here to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Joseph threw his arms around Benjamin’s neck, sobbing, and Benjamin wept on Joseph’s neck.</verse>
				<verse number="15">With tears streaming down his face, Joseph kissed each brother, one by one. After their tearful, emotional embrace, they took time to speak brother-to-brother.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The news reached Pharaoh’s house: “Joseph’s brothers have come.” Pharaoh and his officials were greatly pleased when they heard it.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers: ‘Load your donkeys and return to Canaan.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Get your father and your families and come back to me. I will give you the best of the land in Egypt, and you will enjoy the fat of the land.’</verse>
				<verse number="19">Tell them also: ‘Take Egyptian wagons with you for your wives and little ones and bring their father with them.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Give no thought to leaving your possessions behind; the best of all the land of Egypt will be yours.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Israel’s sons did as they were instructed. Joseph gave them wagons, as the king had ordered, and provided food for their journey.</verse>
				<verse number="22">He gave each of them a set of garments, and to Benjamin he also gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of garments.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He sent his father ten donkeys loaded with the best Egyptian goods and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and other provisions for the journey.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then he sent his brothers off, admonishing them, “Don’t quarrel along the way.” And they departed.</verse>
				<verse number="25">They left Egypt and went back home to their father Jacob in Canaan.</verse>
				<verse number="26">When they arrived, they ran to their father and announced, “Joseph is still alive! Not only that, he is the ruler of all Egypt!” The news so stunned Jacob that he nearly fainted. He could not believe his ears!</verse>
				<verse number="27">But when they told him all that Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons Joseph had sent to take him to Egypt, he recovered from the shock.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“My son Joseph is still alive!” Israel said. “Now I’m convinced! I must go to see him before I die.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="46">
				<verse number="1">Israel packed up all he had and went to Beersheba, where he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.</verse>
				<verse number="2">God spoke to him in visions of the night, and called, “Jacob, Jacob!” “Yes, I’m here,” he answered.</verse>
				<verse number="3">“I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go to Egypt; for I will make your descendants a great nation there.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I will go with you to Egypt, and I will bring your descendants back to this land. And the hand of Joseph will be there to close your eyes when you die.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Jacob set out from Beersheba. His sons put him, their little ones, and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They took their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan and went to Egypt. Jacob took all his descendants with him: his sons, his grandsons, his daughters, his granddaughters.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">Now these are the names of Jacob’s descendants, the Israelites who went to Egypt with him: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn,</verse>
				<verse number="9">and his sons: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Simeon and his sons: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul (the son of a Canaanite woman).</verse>
				<verse number="11">Levi and his sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Judah and his sons: Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. (Judah’s other sons, Er and Onan, had died in Canaan.) Perez’s sons were Hezron and Hamul.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Issachar and his sons: Tola, Puah, Jashub, and Shimron.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Zebulun and his sons: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.</verse>
				<verse number="15">These thirty-three were the sons that Jacob and Leah had while in Paddan-Aram, besides his daughter Dinah.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Gad and his sons: Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Asher and his sons: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. Beriah’s sons were Heber and Malchiel.</verse>
				<verse number="18">These sixteen were the descendants of Jacob and Zilpah (the slave woman whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah).</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jacob’s sons with Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.</verse>
				<verse number="20">In Egypt, Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, by Asenath (the daughter of Potiphera, a priest of On).</verse>
				<verse number="21">Benjamin’s sons were Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.</verse>
				<verse number="22">These fourteen were the descendants of Jacob by Rachel.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Dan and his son: Hushim.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Naphtali and his sons: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.</verse>
				<verse number="25">These seven are the descendants of Jacob and Bilhah (the slave woman Laban gave to his daughter Rachel).</verse>
				<verse number="26">The total number of the direct descendants of Jacob who went to Egypt was sixty-six, not including his sons’ wives.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Two sons were born to Joseph in Egypt, bringing the total number of Jacob’s family who went there to seventy.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Jacob sent Judah ahead to ask Joseph to lead them in Goshen. When they arrived,</verse>
				<verse number="29">Joseph got in his chariot and rode to Goshen to meet his father, Israel. As soon as Joseph saw his father, he threw his arms around his father’s neck and wept for a long time.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Israel said to Joseph, “I am ready to die, now that I have seen you and know that you are still alive.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then Joseph said to his brothers and all his father’s family, “I must go and tell the king that my brothers and all my father’s family have come to me from Canaan.</verse>
				<verse number="32">I will tell him that you are shepherds and take care of livestock and that you have brought with you your flocks and herds and all you own.</verse>
				<verse number="33">When the king calls for you and asks what your occupation is,</verse>
				<verse number="34">be sure to tell him that you and your fathers before you have herded livestock all your lives. Then he will let you live in the region of Goshen.” Joseph said this because Egyptians despise shepherds.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="47">
				<verse number="1">Joseph took five of his brothers with him to Pharaoh and presented them to the king. Joseph said to Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers have come from Canaan with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own. They have made their camp in the region of Goshen.”</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">Pharaoh asked the men, “What is your occupation?” “We, your servants, are shepherds, just as our fathers were,” they answered.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“We have come to stay as temporary residents in this country, because in the land of Canaan, the famine is so severe that there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks. Please give us permission to settle in the land of Goshen.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now that your father and your brothers have arrived,</verse>
				<verse number="6">the land of Egypt is theirs. Let them settle in the best part of the land, in the region of Goshen. And if there are any competent men among them, put them in charge of my own livestock.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Later, Joseph brought Jacob into the house and presented him before Pharaoh. And Jacob gave Pharaoh a blessing.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Pharaoh asked Jacob, “How old are you?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jacob answered, “My earthly journey has been one hundred and thirty years. My years have been few and hard, but it doesn’t compare to the length of the earthly journeys of my fathers.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh again and departed.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So Joseph settled his father and brothers in the choicest part of the land of Egypt, in the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Joseph also provided his father and brothers and their families, down to their little ones, with all the food they needed.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now there was no food anywhere, for the famine was very severe. Both the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And the people of Egypt and Canaan spent all their money to buy grain. Joseph gathered all the money from the sale of grain and deposited the wealth into Pharaoh’s treasury.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When the money ran out in Egypt and Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and pleaded with him, “All our money is gone; give us food! Why would you let us die in front of your eyes?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Joseph answered, “If your money is gone, then give me your livestock. I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">So in that year, they brought their livestock to Joseph—their horses, sheep, cattle, and donkeys—and he supplied them with food in exchange for their livestock.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The next year, they came to him and said, “Master, it’s no secret to you that we are broke. All our silver and livestock are now yours. We have nothing left but ourselves and our lands.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Why would you let us die in front of your eyes, leaving all our lands uninhabited? Buy us and our lands in exchange for food. We’ll become Pharaoh’s slaves and give up our land. Only give us seed so that we may live and not die and so that the land will not become a desert.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">So Joseph gained possession of all the farmland in Egypt for Pharaoh. Every Egyptian sold his land in exchange for food, for the famine was that severe. Eventually, the Egyptians had transferred all the land to Pharaoh.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Everyone became a slave to Pharaoh, from one end of Egypt to the other.</verse>
				<verse number="22">However, he did not take over the land of the priests, for they received royal subsidies from Pharaoh. They lived on the food he provided for them, and that is why they did not have to sell their land.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Joseph said to the people, “Today I have acquired for Pharaoh you and all your land. Here is seed for you to sow in the land.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But when harvest comes, you must pay one-fifth to Pharaoh, and you may keep the rest for planting your fields and for food for yourselves and your families to nourish your household and your little ones.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">“You have saved our lives!” they said. “May we find your favor, our lord, and we will be slaves to Pharaoh.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Thus, Joseph established the law of the land in Egypt, which is still in effect, “A fifth will go to Pharaoh.” Only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh’s.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Israel and his descendants settled in Egypt in the land of Goshen. They had many children and multiplied, and they acquired property.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Jacob lived in Egypt for seventeen years and lived a total of one hundred and forty-seven years.</verse>
				<verse number="29">When the time of Israel’s death was near, he summoned his beloved son Joseph and said to him, “ Son, do me this favor before I die: Place your hand under my thigh as a pledge that you will show me kindness and loyal love. Do not bury me in Egypt,</verse>
				<verse number="30">but when I go to rest with my fathers, I want you to carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Swear that you will do this.” So Joseph took the oath and said, “I will do as you say.” Then Israel worshiped and leaned on the top of his staff.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="48">
				<verse number="1">Not long afterward, Joseph received the news that his father’s health was failing, so he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When Jacob heard that they had come to see him, Israel rallied his strength and sat up in bed.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jacob said to Joseph, “The God who is more than enough appeared to me at Bethel in the land of Canaan where he blessed me!</verse>
				<verse number="4">He said to me, ‘I will make you fruitful and multiply your descendants until I have made you a company of nations. And I will give this land to your descendants for an everlasting possession.’</verse>
				<verse number="5">Furthermore, I will adopt as my very own your two sons who were born in the land of Egypt before I came here. Yes, I claim Ephraim and Manasseh as mine, no less than my two oldest, Reuben and Simeon.</verse>
				<verse number="6">As for any children born after them, they will be considered yours. They will receive their portion of the inheritance in the same territory as their brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For when I was returning from Paddan-Aram, my beloved Rachel died, to my sorrow, in the land of Canaan while we were still on our way, not far from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”</verse>
				<verse number="8">When Israel noticed Joseph’s two sons, he said, “Who are these?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“They are the sons that God has graciously given me here,” Joseph said to his father. “Please bring them closer,” he said, “so that I may bless them.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now Israel could barely see, for his eyes were failing because of old age. So, Joseph brought his sons closer to him, and Joseph’s father, their grandfather, hugged and kissed them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Tearfully, Israel said to Joseph, “I never thought I’d see your face again, and now, God has let me see my grandchildren as well!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Joseph then removed them from his father’s knees and bowed low in respect before his father with his face to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And Joseph took his sons and had them stand facing their grandfather Israel, Ephraim at Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh at Israel’s right hand.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But Israel crossed his arms, and stretched out his right hand on the head of the younger son, Ephraim, and his left hand on the head of the firstborn son, Manasseh.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He spoke this blessing over them: “May the God of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, who lived devoted to him, the God who has been my Shepherd from my birth until this day,</verse>
				<verse number="16">the Angel who has delivered me from all harm, may he bless these boys! May their lives echo my name, and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. May they multiply into teeming multitudes throughout the earth!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">When Joseph saw his father place his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he was not happy, so he tried to move his father’s hand from Ephraim to Manasseh’s head.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Not that way,” Joseph said to his father, “Here, father, put your right hand on the firstborn’s head.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. Manasseh’s descendants will also multiply and become a great people. His younger brother will become even greater than he, and his tribe will one day give rise to many nations.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">So Jacob blessed them that day, saying, “Israel will use your names when they pronounce blessings! They will say, ‘May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh!’ ” So the crossing of his arms during Jacob’s blessing put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then Israel said to Joseph, “Son, I will die soon, but God’s presence will go with you, and one day, he will take you back to the land of your ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I give you one mountain slope more than your brothers, the mountain slope of Shechem, the fertile region I took from the Amorites with my own sword and my own bow.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="49">
				<verse number="1">Jacob called all his sons together and gathered them around his bedside. He said to them, “Let me prophesy to you about your future destinies:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Come together and listen to me, O sons of Jacob, Listen to your father Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Reuben, my firstborn, you are my strength and the firstfruits of my manhood. You are preeminent in pride and surpassing others in power.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You are unstable—as turbulent as floodwaters; you will no longer excel, for you have slept with my concubine and defiled yourself in your father’s bed!</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Simeon and Levi, you are two of a kind and brothers in crime, for your swords have committed violent acts.</verse>
				<verse number="6">O my soul, let me not join in their secret plans. O my heart, never let me be counted in their assembly, for they killed men in fits of rage, and for pleasure, they maimed an ox.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath so relentless. I will divide your descendants throughout Jacob’s territory and scatter them throughout Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“O Judah, your brothers will praise you. You will conquer your foes in battle, And your father’s sons will bow down before you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Judah, my son, you are like a young lion who has devoured its prey and departed. Like a lion, he crouches and lies down, and like a lioness—who dares to awaken him?</verse>
				<verse number="10">The scepter of rulership will not be taken from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from his descendants, until the Shiloh comes and takes what is due him, for the obedience of nations belongs to him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He will tether his donkey to the vine and his purebred colt to the choicest branch. He will wash his garments in wine and his robe in the blood of grapes.</verse>
				<verse number="12">His eyes are more exhilarating than wine and his teeth whiter than milk.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Zebulun will settle along the seashore and become a safe harbor for ships, and his borders will extend to Sidon.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Issachar is a strong donkey lying down between its saddlebags.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When he sees that his resting place is good, and his portion is so pleasant, then he will bend his shoulder to the burden and labor for his master.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Dan will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Dan will be a snake waiting by the roadside, like a snake in the grass. He bites the horse’s heels, making its rider fall backward.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“I wait in hope for your salvation, O  Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Gad will be raided by raiders, but he will raid at their heels and overcome them at last.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Asher’s food will be rich, and he will provide delicacies fit for a king.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Naphtali is a doe set free, who bestows beauty on his offspring.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine growing by a spring, whose branches run over a wall.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Persecutors fiercely attacked him; they pursued him with their bow and arrows.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But Joseph’s bow remained steady, because the power of the Mighty One of Jacob strengthened him, by the name of the loving Shepherd, the Rock of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The God of your father will help and protect you; the God who is more than enough will bless you. He will bless you with the blessings of heaven, blessings of the deep that lie beneath, and blessings of the breast and womb.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The blessings of your father will be greater than the blessings of the eternal mountains, surpassing the blessings of my ancestors! May Joseph’s blessings crown his head and rest on the brow of the one set apart, prince among his brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Benjamin is a ferocious wolf. He devours his prey; in the evening, he divides the spoil.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">All these men became the twelve tribes of Israel. These were prophetic words their father spoke to them when he blessed them, blessing each son with a parting word appropriate to him.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Afterward, Jacob sat on the side of his bed and instructed his sons with these words: “I am about to join my people in death. Bury me with my ancestors in the cave of the field of Ephron the Hittite—</verse>
				<verse number="30">the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, in the land of Canaan. My grandfather Abraham purchased that field as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite.</verse>
				<verse number="31">My grandfather Abraham and my grandmother Sarah are buried there. My father Isaac and my mother Rebekah were buried there also. And it is the place I buried my wife Leah.</verse>
				<verse number="32">So, bury me there, in that cave, in the field that was purchased from the Hittites.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">When Jacob finished his final words of instruction to his sons, he lifted his feet onto the bed, breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="50">
				<verse number="1">Joseph flung himself over Jacob, kissing him and weeping. And his tears fell on his father’s face.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When he was able to compose himself, he ordered the royal physicians to embalm his father. So, they began the required forty-day process. The Egyptians mourned for Israel for seventy days,</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">and when the weeping period was over, Joseph approached Pharaoh’s officials and said to them, “Please, may I ask a personal favor? Bring my appeal before Pharaoh and tell him:</verse>
				<verse number="5">‘My dying father made me promise that I would bury him in the land of Canaan—in a tomb he had hewn with his own hands. Please give me permission to go and bury my father; then I will return.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Go to Canaan, bury your father, and keep your promise to him.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So Joseph went to Canaan to bury his father, and all the officials of Pharaoh, the elite members of his court, and all of Egypt’s dignitaries accompanied him.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All of Joseph’s household and all his brothers and their father’s household went, too. Only the children and livestock remained behind in Goshen.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Many chariots and horsemen—a huge entourage—accompanied Joseph to Canaan in a grand procession!</verse>
				<verse number="10">When they arrived at the threshing floor of Atad on the other side of the Jordan, they mourned loudly with bitter sorrow for a long time. And Joseph spent seven days there in ceremonial mourning for his father.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When the people of Canaan saw the depth of mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a solemn occasion of grief for the Egyptians,” and named the place near the Jordan, The Mourning of the Egyptians.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So Jacob’s sons did as they were instructed</verse>
				<verse number="13">and carried his body to the land of Canaan. They buried him there in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, where Abraham had purchased a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.</verse>
				<verse number="14">After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone with him to bury his father.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When the brothers realized they were now without their father, they said, “What if Joseph still bears a grudge against us and decides to pay us back for all the trouble we brought on him?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So they sent this message to Joseph: “Before he died, your father left us this instruction:</verse>
				<verse number="17">‘Tell Joseph that I beg him to completely forgive the sin of his brothers who treated him so harshly.’ Now, please forgive us, servants of the God of your father, of the horrible wrong we did to you.” Joseph cried and wept as they read this message to him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then his brothers came and threw themselves down before Joseph’s feet, saying, “We are here as your slaves!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">But Joseph dried his tears and said, “Don’t be afraid. How could I ever take the place of God?</verse>
				<verse number="20">Even though you intended to hurt me, God intended it for good. It was his plan all along, to ensure the survival of many people. So, don’t worry. I myself will provide for you all that you need, both for you and your little ones.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then with more kind, reassuring words, Joseph comforted his brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Joseph lived in Egypt along with his father’s family and lived to be one hundred and ten years old.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He lived to see the third generation of Ephraim’s children. Joseph also lived to see the children of Makir, son of Manasseh; and Joseph gave Makir’s children inheritance rights.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then Joseph declared to his brothers, “I will die one day, but God will certainly come to you and fulfill his promises to bring you and your descendants from this land and lead you to the land he promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">So Joseph had his brothers, the sons of Israel, make a solemn oath, saying, “When God comes to you, you will carry my bones up from Egypt.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten. He was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">And after Moses, Yahweh ’s servant, died, Yahweh spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ faithful assistant, and said,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“My servant Moses is dead. Now get up! Prepare to cross the Jordan River, you and all the people. Lead them into the land that I am giving to the Israelites.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Every part of the land where you march I will give you, as I promised Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Your borders will extend from the southern desert to the northern mountains of Lebanon, and from the great river Euphrates in the east, to the Mediterranean in the west—including all the land of the Hittites.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Joshua, no one will be able to defeat you for the rest of your life! I will be with you as I was with Moses, and I will never fail nor abandon you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You must be strong and brave. You will lead the people to acquire and apportion the land that I promised their ancestors I would give them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You must remain very strong and courageous! Be faithful to obey all the teaching that my servant Moses commanded you to follow. Do not deviate from him to the right or to the left, so that you will have overwhelming success in everything you undertake.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Recite this scroll of the law constantly. Contemplate it day and night and be careful to follow every word it contains; then you will enjoy incredible prosperity and success.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I repeat, be strong and brave! Do not yield to fear nor be discouraged, for I am Yahweh your God, and I will be with you wherever you go!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Joshua ordered the leaders of the people:</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Go through the camp and instruct the people, ‘Pack your bags; for within three days you will cross the Jordan to conquer and occupy the land that Yahweh your God is giving you to possess.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Joshua addressed the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh:</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Remember the words that Yahweh ’s servant Moses commanded you: ‘ Yahweh your God is giving you this land on the east side of the Jordan as your homeland.’ Therefore, your wives, your little ones, and your livestock may remain here, but all your valiant warriors must cross over with us armed. They will take the lead and help their brothers</verse>
				<verse number="14"></verse>
				<verse number="15">until they take possession of the land that Yahweh your God is giving them as their homeland. Afterward, you will be free to return to your own land and possess the land that Moses, Yahweh ’s servant, gave you here on the east side of the Jordan.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">They answered Joshua: “We will do everything you have told us and will go wherever you send us.</verse>
				<verse number="17">We always obeyed Moses, and we will always obey you. May Yahweh your God stand beside you as he stood with Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And anyone who questions your authority or disobeys whatever you command shall be put to death. So, Joshua, be strong and brave!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent out two spies from their camp at Acacia. He told them, “Go and explore the land of Canaan, especially Jericho.” They went and arrived at Jericho and entered the house of Rahab the prostitute and lodged there.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The king of Jericho was told: “Some Israelites have come into the city tonight to spy out the entire land. They’re in Rahab’s house.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So the king sent messengers to Rahab, who said to her: “Turn over the men who entered your house. They’re here to spy out our land.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">But Rahab had already hidden the two men. “Yes,” she said. “The men came to me, but I had no idea where they were from.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They left at sundown, just before the city gates were closed at night. Who knows where they went. Quick! Go after them, and maybe you can catch them!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">(Rahab had hidden the men on her rooftop under stalks of flax she had spread out to dry on the roof.)</verse>
				<verse number="7">So the men of Jericho went out to search for the spies, and the city gates were shut behind them. They searched for them as far as where the path crosses the Jordan.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Before the spies had gone to sleep, Rahab went up to the rooftop</verse>
				<verse number="9">and said to them, “I know that Yahweh has given you this land. Everyone is absolutely terrified, and we are all paralyzed with fear because of you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">We’ve heard of the miracles that accompany you and how Yahweh dried up the waters of the Red Sea for you when you left Egypt. We’ve heard how you utterly annihilated the two Amorite kings, Sihon and Og, and their kingdoms who were on the other side of the Jordan.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As soon as we heard it, our hearts melted with fear, and we were left with no courage among us because of you. Yahweh, your God, is the true God who rules in heaven above and on earth below.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Please, solemnly swear to me by the name of Yahweh that you will show kindness to my family because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign</verse>
				<verse number="13">that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all their families. Don’t let us be killed!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">The men answered, “If you don’t disclose our mission to anyone, we’ll pledge our lives for yours. Then, when Yahweh gives us this land, we’ll honor our promise and treat you kindly.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Rahab’s house was built into the city wall, so she let them down from the window by a rope.</verse>
				<verse number="16">She told them, “Head for the hill country and hide. The men chasing you won’t find you there. Hide for three days until they have returned, then you’ll be safe to go your way.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">But the men warned her, “ You must do what we say, or we will not be bound to the oath you made us swear.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When our invasion begins, bring all your family together in your house—your father and mother, your brothers and sisters, and all their families. And tie this crimson rope in the same window through which you let us down.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Remember, if anyone ventures outside your house, his death will be his own fault, not ours! But if anyone inside your house is harmed, then we will be held responsible.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And if you disclose our mission, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Rahab replied in agreement, “Let it be as you say.” And she sent them away, and after they departed, she tied the crimson rope in her window.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The spies went straight to the hill country and hid there for three days, until the pursuers turned back. The king’s men had scoured the countryside without finding them.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then the two men came down from the hills and crossed back over the Jordan to their camp. They reported to Joshua son of Nun all that had happened to them:</verse>
				<verse number="24">“ Yahweh has certainly handed over the entire land into our hands! All the people of the land melt in fear before us!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Joshua was up bright and early the next morning. They broke camp, and Joshua led the Israelites from Acacia to the eastern bank of the Jordan. There they set up camp and waited until they crossed over.</verse>
				<verse number="2">After three days, the leaders of the people went throughout the camp</verse>
				<verse number="3">giving orders to the people, “Watch for the priests of the tribe of Levi to lift the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God. When it starts moving, follow it</verse>
				<verse number="4">so you’ll know which way to go, since you’ve never marched this way before. Follow about a half mile behind the ark; don’t go near it.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Joshua instructed the people, “Get yourselves ready! Set yourselves apart for Yahweh! Tomorrow, Yahweh will perform for us great miracles!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Joshua told the priests, “Raise up the ark of the covenant and step out ahead of the people.” So they lifted the ark onto their shoulders and marched in front of the people.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yahweh said to Joshua, “This very day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel so that they will realize that I am with you in the same way I was with Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You are to command the priests who carry the ark of the covenant with these words: ‘Carry the ark to the edge of the Jordan and wade into the water.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Joshua told the Israelites, “Come closer and listen to the words of Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">This is how you will know for sure that the Living God is among you. As you advance into the land, he will drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go before you and prepare a way for you through the Jordan.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now select twelve men from among the people, one man from each tribe.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“The moment the feet of the priests carrying the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth, touch the water of the Jordan, a great miracle will happen! The water flowing downstream toward you will stop and pile up as if behind a dam.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now it was time for the early harvest, and the river was overflowing at flood stage. When the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests went in front of them carrying the ark of the covenant on their shoulders. The very moment the priests with the ark dipped their feet in the river’s edge,</verse>
				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16">the water coming downstream toward them stopped flowing and piled up in a solid wall as far upstream as Adam, a place near Zarethan. Yahweh completely cut off the flow of the river so that it drained downstream toward the Desert Sea (the Dead Sea). So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now the priests stood firmly on dry ground in the riverbed with the ark on their shoulders. The entire nation passed by the ark as they completed their miracle -crossing on dry ground.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">When the entire nation had finished their miracle-crossing of the Jordan, Yahweh said to Joshua,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Choose twelve men, one from each of the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Instruct each of them to take a stone from the riverbed, twelve stones from the very place where the priests stand with the ark. Have them carry the stones over to the place where you camp tonight.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Joshua summoned the twelve men he had selected from the Israelites, one per tribe.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Joshua instructed them, “Walk out to the middle of the riverbed to the ark of Yahweh your God. Each of you choose a stone and lift it up onto your shoulder—one stone for each tribe.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The stones will always be a sign to you. Someday, when your children ask you, ‘Why are these stones so important?’</verse>
				<verse number="7">tell them, ‘The Jordan stopped flowing in front of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh —the floodwaters were completely cut off.’ These stones will serve as a memorial for Israel forever.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">The Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of Israel, from the middle of the riverbed, and carried them to the camp and put them there.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Joshua set up the memorial stones that they had taken from the exact spot where the priests stood bearing the ark in the riverbed. They remain there to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="10">While the priests remained standing in the middle of the Jordan with the ark on their shoulders, the people hurried across. All the instructions Yahweh had given to Joshua were carried out —just as Moses had told Joshua.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And when Israel had finished crossing, the ark of Yahweh and the priests crossed as the people looked on.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh went across, armed and ready for battle, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had commanded them.</verse>
				<verse number="13">In all, about forty thousand men were equipped for battle. And they all marched before Yahweh to wage war on the plains of Jericho.</verse>
				<verse number="14">On that day, Yahweh exalted Joshua before all the people. As they had stood in awe of Moses, so they stood in awe of Joshua for the rest of his life.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh said to Joshua,</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant to come up from the Jordan.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">So Joshua did as he was commanded,</verse>
				<verse number="18">and the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came up from the riverbed. And the moment their feet touched the western bank of the Jordan, the floodwaters surged back in place where they were before and returned to flood stage.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The people experienced the miracle-crossing of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month of the Jewish calendar. They established their base camp at Gilgal, east of Jericho,</verse>
				<verse number="20">where Joshua set up a memorial with the twelve stones taken from the Jordan.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He told the Israelites, “In time to come, when children ask their fathers, ‘Why are these stones so important?’</verse>
				<verse number="22">tell them, ‘Here is the place where the Israelites crossed the Jordan on dry ground!’</verse>
				<verse number="23">For your God, Yahweh, dried up the waters of the Jordan before your eyes until you crossed over, just as Yahweh your God did for us years ago; he dried up the Red Sea while we crossed over!</verse>
				<verse number="24">He has done these miracles so that all the earth will be in awe of the mighty power of Yahweh and that you might always obey Yahweh your God!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">All the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea became terrified of the Israelites. For when they heard how Yahweh miraculously dried up the Jordan so that the Israelites could cross over, all their courage melted away.</verse>
				<verse number="2">At that time, Yahweh commanded Joshua, “Make knives of flint and circumcise the men of Israel again.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So Joshua made stone knives and circumcised all the men at a place they named Circumcision Hill.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Joshua had to circumcise all the men and boys—all the fighting men. Although they had been circumcised before leaving Egypt, the male children born during the forty years they spent in the wilderness had not been circumcised. Also, by the end of that forty years, all the fighting men who had come out of Egypt had died because they had not listened to the voice of Yahweh. So Yahweh had made an oath that they would not see the land he had promised to give their ancestors, a fertile land.</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">So he raised up their sons in their place, and Joshua circumcised them because they had not been circumcised on the way.</verse>
				<verse number="8">After the circumcision was completed, the whole nation waited in the camp until their wounds had healed.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today, I have rolled away your disgrace from being slaves in Egypt.” For that reason, the place is named Gilgal to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="10">While encamped at Gilgal, not far from Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Feast of Passover in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month of Abib.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The very next day, they ate for the first time food grown in Canaan—roasted grain and flatbread made without yeast.</verse>
				<verse number="12">On that day, when they ate the produce of the land, the manna stopped falling from heaven. The Israelites never ate manna again, but that year they enjoyed the fruit of the land of Canaan.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw standing in front of him a man holding a drawn sword. Joshua approached him and said, “Are you on our side or on our enemies’?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Neither,” he replied. “I have not come to take sides but to take charge. I am the Commander of Yahweh ’s armies.” At once, Joshua threw himself facedown to the ground and worshiped, and he said to him, “I will do whatever you command, my Lord.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">The Commander of Yahweh ’s armies said to Joshua, “Remove your sandals, for you are standing on holy ground!” And Joshua obeyed.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Now the gates of Jericho were bolted and barred because of the Israelites; no one could get in or out.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh commanded Joshua, “See, I have given Jericho, its king and mighty warriors into your hands.</verse>
				<verse number="3">March around the city with all your men of war once a day for six days.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Have seven priests carry shofars in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the shofars.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When you hear the blare of the shofars, have all the people shout with a mighty shout of joy! Then the walls of the city will collapse before your eyes, and your whole army must charge straight in!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and instructed them: “Take up the ark of the covenant, and have seven priests carry seven shofars in front of the ark of Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">And to the people he said, “Forward! March around the city and set an advance guard of armed men to march ahead of the ark of Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">At Joshua’s order, the seven priests carrying seven shofars advanced before Yahweh. The ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them as they made long blasts on their shofars.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The advance guard marched in front of the priests who were blowing the shofars, the rear guard marched behind the ark, and the shofars blared the whole time!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now Joshua had commanded the rest of the people, “Do not shout! Remain silent! Don’t make a sound until the moment I command you to shout. Then lift up a shout with all your might!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So the ark of Yahweh circled the city once, then they all came back to the camp in Gilgal and spent the night.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Joshua rose bright and early the next morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The armed men and the seven priests carrying the seven shofars marched in front of the ark of Yahweh blowing their shofars continually, and the rear guard followed the ark of Yahweh, while the trumpets kept sounding.</verse>
				<verse number="14">On the second day, they circled the city once and again returned to the camp. They repeated this pattern for six days.</verse>
				<verse number="15">On the seventh day, everyone rose at daybreak, and they marched around the city in the same manner seven times.</verse>
				<verse number="16">After their seventh time around, when the priests were about to blow the shofars, Joshua commanded the people: “Shout a shout of joy! Yahweh has given you the city!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jericho and everything in it are to be a devoted offering to Yahweh. But spare Rahab the prostitute and everyone in her house because she hid our spies.</verse>
				<verse number="18">You must not take for yourselves anything that is dedicated to Yahweh or you will bring trouble and destruction to the entire Israelite camp!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Everything made of silver, gold, bronze, and iron is sacred and devoted to Yahweh; place all of it in Yahweh ’s treasury!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">The people were ready to shout with a great shout when they heard the shofars. As soon as they heard the blast of the shofars, they raised a massive shout of jubilee like a thunderclap, and all at once the thick walls of Jericho collapsed! Everyone rushed straight ahead and captured the city.</verse>
				<verse number="21">They utterly destroyed all that was in Jericho, men and women, young and old, livestock and donkeys—everything was destroyed with the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Joshua told the two spies who had entered Jericho, “Go to the prostitute’s house and rescue her and everyone in her house, just as you promised her.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So the two spies brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers and sisters, and all who belonged to her, and gave them refuge outside the camp of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then they burned Jericho to the ground and all that was within it. Only the silver and gold, brass, and iron were placed into the treasury of Yahweh ’s house.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Yet Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, her father’s family, and all that belonged to her. She lives among the Israelites to this day because she hid the two men Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Afterward, Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: “May Yahweh curse anyone who attempts to rebuild this city, Jericho! He will pay for laying its foundation with the life of his oldest son, and for setting up its gates with his youngest son!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Yahweh ’s presence was with Joshua, and he became famous throughout the land.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">But the Israelites violated the commandment regarding the wealth of Jericho that was to be set apart for the Lord. Achan son of Carmi, grandson of Zimri, of the clan of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, stole some of the devoted things for himself. This ignited Yahweh ’s anger against Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Joshua sent spies from Jericho to Ai (a small city near Beth Aven, southeast of Bethel), with orders to spy out the land. So the spies left for Ai.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When they returned to Joshua, they reported to him, “There is no need to trouble the whole army to conquer Ai. The people are so few that two or three thousand men could attack it and take the city.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Joshua sent three thousand troops to attack the city, but they were routed by the men of Ai.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The men of Ai chased them from the city gates, down the hill as far as the quarries, cutting them down as they fled. They killed thirty-six of Joshua’s men, and when Israel heard of their defeat, their hearts melted away with fear!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Joshua and the elders of Israel tore their clothes and threw dust over their heads to show their sorrow. They threw themselves facedown to the ground in front of the ark of Yahweh until the evening sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Joshua cried out, “O Lord Yahweh, why did you lead these people across the Jordan? To be defeated? To be killed by the Amorites? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!</verse>
				<verse number="8">O Lord, what can I say now that Israel has retreated from its enemies?</verse>
				<verse number="9">When the Canaanites and everyone else in the land hear about our defeat, they will gang up on us and wipe us off the face of the earth. And what then will you do about your great name?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yahweh spoke to Joshua: “Stand up! Why are you groveling before me?</verse>
				<verse number="11">Israel has sinned! They have broken the covenant which I had commanded them to keep. They have taken forbidden plunder. They have stolen from me, taken what is mine, hidden it among their belongings, and lied about it.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Cursed things are among you! That is why Israel is powerless, has retreated from their enemies, and is in danger of annihilation. If you do not get rid of these cursed things from among you, I will not go with you any longer.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Get up and purify the people in preparation for tomorrow. Tell them, ‘This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel says: “O Israel, you have in your midst what must be devoted entirely to me! You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove the devoted things from your midst!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Tomorrow morning, you shall present yourselves by tribes. Yahweh will indicate which tribe must come forward by clans. Yahweh will indicate which clan must come forward by families. And Yahweh will indicate which family must come forward one by one.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then finally, Yahweh will expose the man caught with the devoted things, which must be destroyed by fire. Everything that man owns you must likewise destroy by fire, for he has violated the covenant of Yahweh and committed an outrageous act in Israel!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Joshua was up at the crack of dawn and had Israel come forward by tribes, and Yahweh indicated the tribe of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Joshua then had the clans of Judah come forward, and Yahweh picked out the clan of Zerah. Joshua then had the clan of Zerah come forward and Yahweh indicated the family of Zimri.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Joshua then had Zimri’s family come forward one by one, and Yahweh picked out Achan, the son of Carmi, son of Zimri, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and confess. Tell me the truth and do not hide anything from him. What have you done?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">“It’s true,” Achan said. “I’ve sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel. This is what I did:</verse>
				<verse number="21">I saw among the plunder an exquisite robe from Babylon, two hundred pieces of silver, and a fifty-shekel bar of gold. I wanted them badly, so I took them and buried them in my tent with the silver underneath.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent, and there it was! They found it buried in the middle of the tent with the silver underneath.</verse>
				<verse number="23">They took the stolen objects from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and displayed them in the presence of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan son of Zerah along with the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, and all that belonged to him—his sons, daughters, donkeys, oxen, sheep, tent—everything. Joshua led them all to the Valley of Trouble</verse>
				<verse number="25">and said, “Why have you brought all this trouble on us? Yahweh will bring trouble on you today!” Then all the people stoned Achan and his family to death. They burned up the bodies and all Achan’s possessions.</verse>
				<verse number="26">They raised over him a huge mound of stones that remains to this day. That is why the place was called the Valley of Trouble ever since. Afterward, Yahweh ’s anger subsided against Israel.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not yield to fear nor shrink back because of Israel’s failure. Now, get up, take all your soldiers with you, and march against Ai. See, I have handed over to you the city, the king, his people, and his land.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Do to Ai what you did to Jericho and its king, except this time, you may take the plunder, including livestock. Set an ambush behind the city.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Joshua and his entire army set out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand valiant warriors and sent them ahead by night</verse>
				<verse number="4">with these instructions: “Now pay attention. Set an ambush behind Ai, but don’t hide very far away. Stay alert and ready for battle!</verse>
				<verse number="5">I’ll lead the rest of the army and make a direct assault on the city, and when they come out to fight us, we’ll flee from them as we did the first time.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When this happens, they’ll say to themselves, ‘Look! They’re running away from us, just like last time!’ And they’ll keep chasing us until we’ve lured them away from the city. While we’re running away from them,</verse>
				<verse number="7">jump up from your hiding place, race into Ai, and seize it. Yahweh, your God, will deliver the city into your hands!</verse>
				<verse number="8">When you’ve captured the city, set it on fire. Now that you have your orders, go and do as Yahweh has commanded!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Joshua then sent them off, and they proceeded to take up a concealed position west of Ai, between Ai and Bethel, while Joshua spent the night with the rest of the troops.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So early the next morning, Joshua mustered his troops. He and the leaders of Israel went in front of the army and led them toward Ai.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The entire fighting force with Joshua advanced until they were near the city and encamped north of Ai, with a valley between them and the city.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He placed a smaller force of about five thousand men west of the city to set an ambush between Bethel and Ai.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The main fighting force north of the city prepared for battle, while the rear guard held a concealed position west of the city. Joshua spent the night in the valley.</verse>
				<verse number="14">At dawn, when the king of Ai saw the Israelites, he and his army rushed out to fight. They ran to attack Israel at a predetermined place en route to the Arabah, not knowing that an ambush had been set against them behind the city.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Joshua and all the main fighting force fled toward the wilderness as though they were being overcome.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Joshua’s tactic drew all of Ai’s reinforcements out of the city, and they set off in hot pursuit of Joshua and his men.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Not a man remained in Ai or in Bethel who did not go out in pursuit of Israel, leaving their city undefended.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Yahweh spoke to Joshua and said, “Now, take the spear in your hand and point it toward Ai, for I will hand the city over to you!” So Joshua pointed his spear toward the city,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and when Joshua gave this signal, all the men waiting in ambush behind the city jumped up from their position and poured into Ai. They quickly captured it and set it on fire.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When the men of Ai looked back, they saw the smoke of their city rising to the sky. Joshua and his men also saw the smoke and knew that the other Israelite soldiers had captured the city and had set it on fire. The army of Ai had no place to escape, so Joshua and his men turned on them and began killing them.</verse>
				<verse number="21"></verse>
				<verse number="22">The men who had taken the city came out and joined the battle, so the Israelites had them surrounded. Israel cut them down, leaving neither survivors nor fugitives.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Joshua’s men killed all the inhabitants of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them. They all fell by the sword. Then the Israelites turned to attack Ai and killed those who were still there.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Joshua kept his spear pointed at Ai until the destruction was complete. Ai’s entire population, twelve thousand men and women, fell that day.</verse>
				<verse number="26"></verse>
				<verse number="27">However, the Israelites took the livestock and the goods captured in the city as Yahweh had instructed Joshua.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then Joshua burned Ai to the ground and reduced it to a mound of ruins for all time. It remains desolate to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until sunset. Then at sunset, Joshua had the corpse taken down and left it lying in front of where the city gates once stood. They raised a large pile of stones over his corpse, where it remains to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Afterward, Joshua built near Mount Ebal a stone altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="31">He made it according to the teaching in the law of Moses, Yahweh ’s servant. Moses had commanded them to build an altar using stones that had not been cut with iron tools. On it they offered to Yahweh burnt sacrifices and fellowship offerings.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And with the Israelites looking on, Joshua inscribed on stones the law which Moses had written.</verse>
				<verse number="33">All Israel, including their elders, officials, and judges, stood on either side of the ark. Both native-born citizens and immigrants alike faced the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and the Levitical priests who carried it. In front of half of them stood Mount Gerizim, and in front of the other half stood Mount Ebal, as Yahweh ’s servant Moses commanded at first to bless the people of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Afterward, Joshua read aloud all the words of the law, the blessings and the curses, exactly as it was written in the scroll of the law.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Joshua read aloud every word that Moses had commanded, and all the assembly of Israel heard it, including the women, the children, and the foreigners who accompanied them.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things—those in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the entire coast of the Great Sea as far as Lebanon (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites)—</verse>
				<verse number="2">they came together to make war against Joshua and Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When the inhabitants of Gibeon learned how Joshua had destroyed Jericho and Ai,</verse>
				<verse number="4">they resorted to a ruse: They sent a delegation disguised as messengers from a distant land. They loaded their donkeys with worn-out sacks and old, patched wineskins.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They wore old, patched sandals on their feet and old, tattered clothes, and took along dry, moldy bread.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When they arrived at Israel’s camp at Gilgal, they said to Joshua and the Israelites: “We’ve come from a far country to propose that you make a treaty with us.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">The men of Israel asked the Hivites, “Perhaps you live nearby. Why should we make a treaty with you?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">“We are willing to be your servants,” they answered Joshua. Joshua questioned them further, “Who are you and where are you from?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">The Gibeonites replied: “Your servants come from a very distant land because we’ve heard of the fame of your God, Yahweh. We’ve heard of his wonders and all that he did in Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="10">We’ve also heard of all he did to help you defeat the two Amorite kings on the other side of the Jordan—King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Therefore, our leaders and all the inhabitants of our land sent us to find you with these instructions: ‘Get food ready for your long trip, and go to the Israelites and say to them, “Make a treaty with us. We’re willing to be your servants.” ’</verse>
				<verse number="12">Look at our bread! It was still warm when we left home with it. See how dry and moldy it’s become!</verse>
				<verse number="13">These wineskins were new when we filled them. See how they’ve dried up and burst! And look, our clothes and sandals are worn out from our long journey.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">The leaders of Israel ratified a peace treaty with the Gibeonites by sharing a meal together, but they failed to consult with Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Joshua agreed to let them live. He made a peace treaty with them, and the leaders of the assembly sealed it with an oath.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But three days after the treaty had been made, the Israelites learned that they had been deceived. In fact, the Gibeonites were from the local area and lived nearby.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So the Israelites set out at once, and on the third day, they came to their cities: Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But the Israelites did not attack them because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. This caused Israel to grumble against their leaders,</verse>
				<verse number="19">but the leaders told the assembly of Israel, “We cannot touch them, for we swore an oath to them in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="20">We must let them live for fear that God’s anger will come upon us because of the oath we swore to them.” So they became woodcutters and water carriers for the community of Israel, as their leaders had decreed.</verse>
				<verse number="21"></verse>
				<verse number="22">Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and asked them, “Why did you deceive us? You told us that you lived very far from us, but we now know for a fact that you live right here near us.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Therefore, we will spare your lives, but you will live under a curse, and you will be condemned to perpetual servitude. You will serve the house of my God by cutting wood and carrying water for us.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">They answered Joshua, “We lied, sir, because we greatly feared for our lives. We know for certain all about Moses and how he served Yahweh, your God. We know for certain that Yahweh will honor his promise to Moses and give you all these lands as your own. And we know for certain that he commanded you to wipe out all the inhabitants living here and thus take possession of this land.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now we are at your mercy, so do with us what you consider right and proper.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">So Joshua had mercy and saved them from being killed by the Israelites.</verse>
				<verse number="27">That day, he made them woodcutters and water carriers to serve the community of Israel for the altar of Yahweh at his divinely chosen place. And that is what they do to this day.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Adoni-zedek, the king of Jerusalem, was struck with fear when he heard how Joshua had totally destroyed the kings and cities of Ai and Jericho and that the people of Gibeon had made a peace treaty with Israel and were living alongside them. The city of Gibeon was larger than Ai, as large as any of the cities that were ruled by a king, and all its men were known as great warriors.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">So King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem sent messages to King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon:</verse>
				<verse number="4">“The people of Gibeon have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites. Come and help me attack them.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The five Amorite kings joined forces—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon. Their combined armies surrounded Gibeon and attacked it.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The Gibeonites sent out a call for help to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal: “Don’t abandon us, for we are your servants! Come quickly and save us! Help us, for the Amorite kings of the hill country have surrounded us!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So Joshua and all his fighting men, all the mighty warriors of Israel, left Gilgal to aid the Gibeonites.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh spoke to Joshua: “Do not fear the Amorite kings and their armies, for I have decreed your victory over them; not one will withstand you!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Joshua and his fighting force marched all night long from Gilgal to Gibeon and took them all by surprise!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Joshua inflicted a crushing defeat on them at Gibeon, for Yahweh threw the Amorites into a panic at the sudden sight of Israel’s army! Yahweh empowered Joshua and his army to chase them in the direction of the Beth Horon ascent, and they slaughtered the kings’ armies all the way to Azekah and the city of Makkedah.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As the Amorites raced down the hill to Beth Horon, Yahweh hurled large hailstones on them from the sky! The hail continued to fall all the way to Azekah; in fact, more men died from Yahweh ’s hailstones than by the swords of the Israelites.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yahweh gave the men of Israel victory over the Amorites that day, the day when Joshua stood before the people and prayed to Yahweh: “Sun, stand still over Gibeon! Moon, stay where you are over the valley of Aijalon!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">And so the sun stood still in the middle of the sky and was in no hurry to set until one day became two. And the moon halted while the nation triumphed over its enemies—as it is also recorded in the Scroll of the Upright One.</verse>
				<verse number="14">It was the day Yahweh himself fought for Israel! There has never been a day like it before or since—a day when Yahweh obeyed the voice of a man!</verse>
				<verse number="15">After their victory, Joshua and his fighting men returned to their camp at Gilgal.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Meanwhile, the five Amorite kings fled and hid in a cave at Makkedah.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in a cave at Makkedah,</verse>
				<verse number="18">Joshua ordered his men, “Seal up the mouth of the cave with large stones and post guards in front of it.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But don’t stop! Pursue your enemies! Cut off their retreat and don’t let them reach their cities, for Yahweh your God has given them into your hand!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">So Joshua and the Israelites nearly killed them all—almost to a man—although a few escaped into the fortified cities.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The whole army returned safely to Joshua at the camp in Makkedah. No one dared speak against the Israelites.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then Joshua ordered, “Open up the cave and bring the five kings out to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So Joshua’s men removed the five kings from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, and brought them before Joshua.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Joshua summoned all of Israel and ordered his army officers, “Place your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they placed their feet upon their necks!</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then Joshua said to his officers, “Never be afraid of your enemies or let them discourage you. Be strong and filled with courage! Yahweh is going to do to all your enemies what he’s done to these kings!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then Joshua had the kings executed and hanged on five trees, and he left them there until evening.</verse>
				<verse number="27">At sunset, Joshua ordered them taken down from the trees and thrown into the cave where they had been hiding. He had large stones rolled over the mouth of the cave, and they remain there to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="28">That day, Joshua captured Makkedah, annihilated the inhabitants, and put its king to the sword, leaving no survivors. And he did to its king what had been done to the king of Jericho.</verse>
				<verse number="29">From Makkedah, Joshua and his army marched southwest to the city of Libnah and attacked it.</verse>
				<verse number="30">By the power of Yahweh, the city and its king were handed over to the Israelites. They annihilated all the inhabitants with the sword, leaving no survivors. And they did to its king what they had done to the king of Jericho.</verse>
				<verse number="31">From Libnah, Joshua and his army marched south to the city of Lachish and attacked it.</verse>
				<verse number="32">By the power of Yahweh, the city was handed over to Joshua on the second day of the battle. They annihilated all the inhabitants of the city, just as they had done to Libnah.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Meanwhile, Horam, king of Gezer, had marched out to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army, leaving no survivors.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then Joshua and all the Israelite army marched on from Lachish to attack the city of Eglon.</verse>
				<verse number="35">By the power of Yahweh, they captured the city in one day and destroyed its inhabitants, just as they had done to Lachish.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then Joshua and all the Israelite army marched from Eglon and attacked Hebron.</verse>
				<verse number="37">By the power of Yahweh, they captured the city, the king, and nearby villages, and totally wiped out all the inhabitants, leaving no survivors, just as they had done to Eglon.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Lastly, Joshua and all the Israelite army turned around and attacked Debir.</verse>
				<verse number="39">By the power of Yahweh, they captured the city, the king, and nearby villages, and totally wiped out all the inhabitants, leaving no survivors. They did to Debir and its king as they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Yahweh empowered Joshua to conquer the whole region, including the hill country, the southern desert, the western foothills, and the mountain slopes. He conquered all the kings of the land and left no survivors. Everything that breathed was slaughtered—as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Joshua’s conquest stretched from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza, and from Goshen to Gibeon.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Joshua conquered all their kings and their lands in a single campaign, for Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for his people.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Finally, Joshua and all the Israelite army returned to their base camp in Gilgal.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">When the news of Israel’s southern victories reached King Jabin of Hazor, he organized a massive coalition to fight against Israel. He sent messages to: King Jobab of Merom, the king of Shimron, the king of Achshaph,</verse>
				<verse number="2">the kings of the northern hill country, the kings of the Jordan Valley south of Lake Galilee, the kings of the foothills, the western kings in the heights of Dor,</verse>
				<verse number="3">the eastern and western Canaanite kings, the Amorite kings, the Hittite kings, the Perizzite kings, the Jebusite kings in the highlands, and the Hivite kings who lived near Mount Hermon in the land of Mizpah.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They came out in full force with a multitude of horses and chariots. Their vast armies were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore.</verse>
				<verse number="5">All these kings and their enormous armies joined forces and encamped at Lake Merom to fight against Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying, “Don’t be afraid of them; by this time tomorrow, I, Yahweh, will have them all lying slain before Israel. After the battle, cripple their horses and burn their chariots.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Joshua launched his surprise attack, and all his army pounced on them at their camp at Lake Merom.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh fought alongside Joshua’s fighting men to defeat them. Part of the Israelite army attacked and pursued the retreating forces as far north as the cities of Misrephoth Maim and Sidon. Another part of the Israelite army pursued the enemy as far east as the valley of Mizpah and crushed them all, leaving no survivors.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Afterward, Joshua crippled their horses and burned their chariots as Yahweh had commanded.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Because Hazor at that time was the most powerful of all these kingdoms, Joshua circled back after the battle and conquered it.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They killed the king, burned Hazor to the ground, and annihilated all its inhabitants. They spared not one breathing thing, leaving no survivors.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Joshua conquered all those royal cities and their kings. He destroyed them all, as Yahweh ’s servant Moses had commanded.</verse>
				<verse number="13">However, of all the cities built on mounds, Joshua burned down only Hazor.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The Israelites kept all the spoils of these towns, including the livestock, but the inhabitants they killed with the sword. There were no survivors.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Just as Yahweh commanded his servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua obeyed everything that Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So Joshua conquered the entire region: the Judean hills, the southern desert, all the land of Goshen, the foothills, the lowlands of the Jordan Valley, the northern hill country of Israel including its lowlands—</verse>
				<verse number="17">everything from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, all the way to Baal-Gad in the Lebanon Valley below Mount Hermon. Joshua captured all their kings and executed them.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Joshua waged war with all those kings over a long period.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Apart from the Hivites living in Gibeon, not one city made peace with Israel. By the power of Yahweh, Joshua conquered them all.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yahweh himself hardened their hearts and made them obstinate so they would attack Israel. Yahweh had determined to wipe them out and condemn them to destruction without mercy, just as he had commanded Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Joshua also drove out the Anakim, a race of giants, from the hill country (including the cities of Hebron, Debir, and Anab)—from the entire hill country of Judah and Israel. Joshua destroyed the Anakim and their towns</verse>
				<verse number="22">so that there were no surviving Anakim in Israelite territory. Some survived but only in the Philistine cities of Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Joshua conquered the whole land, just as Yahweh had promised Moses. Joshua assigned portions of the land to each of the tribes of Israel, and the Israelites lived in peace throughout the land.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">On the east side of the Jordan, Moses and the Israelites had conquered two kings, Sihon and Og. The Israelites occupied their territory, which extended from the Arnon Valley in the south to Mount Hermon in the north, including the entire eastern desert.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Sihon, king of the Amorites, reigned in Heshbon and ruled over the southern half of Gilead, from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon River Valley in the south to the River Jabbok in the north, which is the border of the Ammonites.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The western area of his kingdom included the eastern desert from Lake Galilee to the Dead Sea (the Salt Sea). His territory included the area east of the Dead Sea as far as the town of Beth Jeshimoth and as far south as Mount Pisgah.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Og, the king of Bashan, was one of the last of the race of giants. He reigned in the cities of Ashtaroth and Edrei. He ruled over all of Bashan, the northern half of Gilead, to the boundary of Sihon, king of Heshbon.</verse>
				<verse number="5">His territory included Mount Hermon in the north and Salecah in the east, and south to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Moses and the Israelites conquered the two kings, Sihon and Og. Moses, the servant of Yahweh, divided their land east of the Jordan among the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh.</verse>
				<verse number="7">On the west side of the Jordan, Joshua and the Israelites defeated thirty-one kings, from Baal-Gad in the Lebanon Valley in the north to Mount Halak in the south near Edom. Then Joshua divided this land among the tribes of Israel and gave them their portions as permanent possessions—</verse>
				<verse number="8">the hill country, the western foothills, and the Jordan Valley, the mountain slopes, the wilderness of Judea, and the southern desert region— the land of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Many years passed, and Joshua was a very old man. One day, Yahweh spoke to him: “Although you have reached a ripe old age, a great deal of land remains for you to conquer.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The territory waiting for you to possess includes all the land of the Geshurites and the Philistines. (The kings of the Philistines lived at Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.)</verse>
				<verse number="3">And also all the territory of the Avvites to the south. (The land from the stream of Shihor, at the Egyptian border, as far north as the border of Ekron was considered Canaanite.)</verse>
				<verse number="4">There is still all the Canaanite territory from the Sidonian city of Mearah (which belonged to the Sidonians) as far as the Amorite border city of Aphek.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You have still not conquered the land of the Gebalites, all the land eastward to Lebanon, from the city of Baal-Gad, which is south of Mount Hermon, to Hamath Pass.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You still must conquer the land of the Sidonians who live in the hill country between the Lebanon Mountains and Misrephoth Maim. As the people of Israel advance, I myself will drive out these peoples from before you! Divide the land among the tribes of Israel exactly as I have commanded you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Divide among the other nine tribes and the other half-tribe of Manasseh the territory west of the Jordan to possess as their inheritance.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had already received their portion of the land on the east side of the Jordan, which Yahweh ’s servant Moses had assigned to them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">These tribes occupied the land as far southeast as the city of Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley, including the city in the middle of the valley and the plain from Dibon in the south, north to Medeba.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Their territory went as far east as the border of Ammon, including all the cities over which King Sihon, the Amorite king, ruled over from Heshbon.</verse>
				<verse number="11">It also included Gilead, the land of the Geshurites and Maacathites, all of Mount Hermon, and all of Bashan to its eastern boundary of Salecah.</verse>
				<verse number="12">It encompassed the entire kingdom of Og (the last of the Rephaites) in Bashan, who ruled from Ashtaroth and at Edrei. Moses had defeated them and possessed their lands,</verse>
				<verse number="13">except for the Geshurites and Maacathites, who still live among the Israelites to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="14">However, Moses did not assign any land as an inheritance to the tribe of Levi, for their inheritance was to share in the sacrificial offerings made to Yahweh, the God of Israel, as he promised them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The land Moses assigned to the families of the tribe of Reuben</verse>
				<verse number="16">extended from Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon Valley, including the city in the middle of the valley, the whole plain of Medeba,</verse>
				<verse number="17">Heshbon and all its surrounding towns on the plain, including Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,</verse>
				<verse number="18">Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,</verse>
				<verse number="19">Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the hill in the valley,</verse>
				<verse number="20">Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth,</verse>
				<verse number="21">including all the cities of the plain, and the whole kingdom of Sihon the Amorite, who had ruled at Heshbon. Moses defeated him and the Midianite tribal chiefs, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, who dwelt in the land as princes of Sihon.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Among those the Israelites killed in battle was the fortune-teller Balaam son of Beor.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The western boundary of the Reubenites was the Jordan River. These cities and their surrounding villages comprised the inheritance of the families of the tribe of Reuben.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The land Moses assigned to the families of the tribe of Gad</verse>
				<verse number="25">included Jazer, all the cities of Gilead, and half the Ammonite country as far as Aroer, near Rabbah.</verse>
				<verse number="26">It extended north from the city of Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, continuing on to the city of Mahanaim, and to the borders of Lo-Debar.</verse>
				<verse number="27">In addition, the tribe of Gad received the land along the eastern side of the Jordan River as far north as the southern end of Lake Galilee. This included the cities of Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Sukkoth, and Zaphon, all of which were in the Jordan Valley.</verse>
				<verse number="28">These cities and their surrounding villages comprised the inheritance of the families of the tribe of Gad.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The land Moses assigned to the families of the half-tribe of Manasseh</verse>
				<verse number="30">extended north from the city of Mahanaim, including all of Bashan and the sixty villages of Jair. King Og of Bashan had once ruled over all this territory.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Moses had given half of Gilead to this half-tribe of Manasseh, which descended from Manasseh’s son Machir, including the cities of Ashtaroth and Edrei, where king Og had once ruled.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Moses had distributed all the territory of Moab in the Jordan Valley east of Jericho as the inheritances of these two and a half tribes of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But Moses gave no inheritance of land to the tribe of Levi, but said to them, “ Yahweh, the God of Israel, is to be your inheritance.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the Israelite tribal leaders divided the land west of the Jordan among the people of Israel as their inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="2">By drawing lots, Eleazar assigned territory to the nine and a half tribes, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The descendants of Joseph were divided into two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. Moses had already granted land east of the Jordan, but the tribe of Levi did not receive land as their inheritance. However, they were assigned cities in which to live and pasturelands for their property and livestock.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">So the Israelites divided the land as Yahweh had commanded Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="6">One day, while Israel was encamped at Gilgal, the people of Judah approached Joshua, including Caleb son of Jephunneh from the Kenizzite clan. Caleb said to Joshua, “Remember what Yahweh said to Moses about you and me while we were still at Kadesh Barnea.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I was forty years old when Moses, Yahweh ’s servant, sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land of Canaan, and I brought back an honest and accurate report.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I have been faithful and obedient to Yahweh, my God. But my fellow spies who went with me only discouraged the people and made their hearts shrink back with fear.</verse>
				<verse number="9">On that day, Moses made an oath and promised me, ‘Every part of the land your feet tread upon shall be an inheritance for you and your descendants forever because you were loyal to Yahweh, my God.’</verse>
				<verse number="10">“ So here I am. It’s been forty-five years since Yahweh made this promise to Moses, when Israel journeyed through the wilderness. Yahweh has preserved me, an eighty-five-year-old man, to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I’m still as strong today as on that day when Moses sent me out! I’m just as fit to go out to battle now as I was then.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now give me the hill country that Yahweh promised me on that day. You yourself were there and heard the report that the Anakim lived there in strong and fortified cities. I know that with the power of Yahweh helping me, I will drive them out, just as Yahweh said!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Joshua spoke God’s blessing over Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since because he passionately followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="15">(Hebron used to be called the City of Arba, after Arba, the most famous of all the Anakim.) Then the land was free of war.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Here is the land allotted to the families of the tribe of Judah: Their territory extended southward to the Wilderness of Zin, which belonged to Edom.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Their boundary started from the bay at the southern end of the Dead Sea,</verse>
				<verse number="3">crossed south of Scorpion Pass, continued to Zin, and went on south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it went past Hezron up to Addar and curved around to Karka,</verse>
				<verse number="4">continued to Azmon and followed the stream on the border of Egypt in a northwesterly direction to the Mediterranean Sea. That is the southern border of all the tribes of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The Dead Sea formed the eastern border of Judah, and its territory lay to the west toward the Mediterranean Sea. Their northern border began there</verse>
				<verse number="6">and went up to Beth Hoglah and continued north of the ridge overlooking the Jordan Valley. From there it went up to the Stone of Bohan, named after Bohan, Reuben’s son.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The boundary then went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor and turned north to Gilgal, which faces Adummim Pass south of the gorge. It continued along to the waters of En Shemesh and ended at En Rogel.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the boundary ran through the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of Jebus (now known as Jerusalem). From there it went to the top of the hill west of the Hinnom Valley at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaites.</verse>
				<verse number="9">It continued from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and from there to the town of Mount Ephron and on to Baalah, which today is called Kiriath Jearim.</verse>
				<verse number="10">It then turned west from Baalah to Mount Seir and ran along the northern shoulder of Mount Jearim (that is, Kesalon), descended to the city of Beth Shemesh, and crossed to the city of Timnah.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The border then went north to the ridge of the city of Ekron, turned toward the city of Shikkeron, crossed to Mount Baalah, and came out at the city of Jamnia. The border ended at the southern end of the Dead Sea.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The western boundary was the Mediterranean coastline. This was the territory that belonged to the families of the tribe of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh had commanded Joshua, “Give a share of the territory from the tribe of Judah to Caleb son of Jephunneh.” So Joshua gave him the city of Hebron which was founded by Arba, the ancestor of Anak.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Caleb drove out three Anakim from Hebron: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai—descendants of Anak.</verse>
				<verse number="15">From Hebron, he marched out and fought against the people of Debir, which used to be called Kiriath Sepher.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Caleb once promised, “Whoever succeeds in capturing Kiriath Sepher may marry my daughter Achsah.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Caleb’s nephew Othniel, the son of his brother Kenaz, took the city, so Caleb gave him the hand of his daughter Achsah in marriage.</verse>
				<verse number="18">One day, Achsah came and charmed her father so that she could ask him for a gift. When she got down from her donkey, Caleb said to her, “What would you like for a wedding present?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Father,” she replied, “give me a special gift. You have already given me land, but it’s in arid country. Please, also give me some springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs near the city of Hebron.</verse>
				<verse number="20">These are the cities given as an inheritance to the families of the tribe of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The cities of the first district in the extreme south near the border of Edom included Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,</verse>
				<verse number="22">Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,</verse>
				<verse number="23">Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,</verse>
				<verse number="24">Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,</verse>

				<verse number="33">The cities of the second district in the western foothills included Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah,</verse>
				<verse number="34">Zanoah, En Gannim, Tappuah, Enam,</verse>
				<verse number="35">Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">The territory assigned to Joseph’s descendants began east of the springs of Jericho near the Jordan, then turned north through the desert and into the hill country as far as Bethel.</verse>
				<verse number="2">From Bethel (that is, Luz), it crossed over to Arkite territory at Ataroth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">It then descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the border of Lower Beth Horon and Gezer, ending at the Mediterranean Sea.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Ephraim and Manasseh, the descendants of Joseph, inherited this entire territory.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The southern boundary of the territory of the tribe of Ephraim went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon</verse>
				<verse number="6">then westward to the Sea. The northern boundary went from Michmethath to the east of Taanath-Shiloh and going further to the east of Janoah.</verse>
				<verse number="7">From Janoah the border descended to Ataroth and Naarah. It touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan River.</verse>
				<verse number="8">From Tappuah, it proceeded westward to the Kanah Ravine and ended at the Sea. The inheritance of the families of the tribe of Ephraim also included the towns and villages set apart for them within the territory of West Manasseh.</verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10">However, the Ephraimites did not drive out the Canaanites from the city of Gezer, but they conscripted the Canaanites to serve them to this day.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">Joshua assigned land to the descendants of Manasseh, Joseph’s firstborn son. Joshua allotted Gilead and Bashan to Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a brave warrior.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And Joshua assigned land west of the Jordan River to the rest of the tribe of Manasseh. The male descendants of Manasseh were Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. All of these men were heads of families, and each of their families received territory west of the Jordan River.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Manasseh’s grandson Gilead had a son named Hepher who had a son named Zelophehad, who had no sons. But he did have five daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They came before the priest Eleazar and Joshua son of Nun and the leaders, and said, “ Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our relatives.” So according to Yahweh ’s commandment, he gave an inheritance to them as he did to their uncles.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Since Joshua assigned land to both Manasseh’s male and female descendants, the tribe of Manasseh received ten shares of land on the west side of the Jordan River and two on the east (the territories of Gilead and Bashan).</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">The northwest territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Michmethath, which is east of Shechem; the boundary went southward to the inhabitants of the spring of Tappuah</verse>
				<verse number="8">and divided the land of Tappuah belonging to the tribe of Manasseh from the town of Tappuah belonging to the Ephraimites.</verse>
				<verse number="9">From there, the southern border followed the Kanah Stream westward to the Mediterranean Sea. The main territory of Manasseh lay north of the stream of Kanah, but south of it were some cities that belonged to the tribe of Ephraim even though they were located inside the territory of Manasseh. In the northwest, Manasseh bordered on the tribe of Asher, and in the northeast, it bordered on the tribe of Issachar.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">Within these two territories, there were several cities together with their surrounding towns that belonged to Manasseh: Beth Shean, Ibleam, Dor, Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo. These constituted three regions.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yet the men of Manasseh failed to take possession of those towns, and the Canaanites continued to live in that land.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Later, when the Israelites grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor but did not utterly drive them out.</verse>
				<verse number="14">One day, the descendants of Joseph came to Joshua and said, “ Yahweh has blessed us with many people, but you have given us only one part of the land. We ought to have more land!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Joshua said to them, “If the hill country of Ephraim is too small for the large number of people in your tribes, then go into the forests which belong to the Perizzites and the Rephaites, and clear ground for yourselves there.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">The descendants of Joseph answered, “Indeed, there’s not enough room for us in the hill country of Ephraim. Yet all the Canaanites who live in the plain have chariots with iron-rimmed wheels, both those in Beth Shean and its villages, and those in the Valley of Jezreel.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then Joshua said to the tribe of Ephraim and the half-tribe of Manasseh, “There are indeed many people in your tribes, and for that reason, you are very powerful. I will give you more than one share of land.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Therefore, I will give you the hill country as well. It is a forest, but Yahweh will empower you to take possession of it and clear it from one end to the other. You will conquer all the Canaanites even though they not only have iron chariots but also are a strong people.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">After the Israelites had conquered the land, all of them gathered at Shiloh, and the priests set up the tabernacle.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Joshua addressed the seven tribes that remained who had not yet received their inheritance: “How much more time will you waste until you go out and possess the land that Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, has given you?</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">The tribes of Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their allotted land east of the Jordan which Moses, Yahweh ’s servant, assigned them. The tribe of Judah already has its territory in the south, and the descendants of Joseph have their territory in the north. So let each of the seven remaining tribes select three men and send them to me. I will send them out to survey and make a map of the entire land. Divide the territory into seven districts and bring the description of each district to me. Then I will draw lots before Yahweh our God to determine which section he has chosen for each tribe to receive. But the Levites will not have an allotted portion among you, for their inheritance is to serve as Yahweh ’s priests.”</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">The tribes each selected three men, and as they set out on their journey, Joshua told them, “Go through all the land and write down its description. When you bring the description back here to me, I will ask Yahweh in Shiloh to divide the land among your tribes.” So the men went through all the land and divided it into seven sections. They wrote a description of each section and also made a list of the towns within each section and returned to Joshua at Shiloh.</verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Joshua cast lots in Yahweh ’s presence at Shiloh and assigned a section of the land to each of the remaining tribes of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The first lot came out for the families of Benjamin. So the first tribe that received territory was the tribe of Benjamin. Joshua assigned them land which lay between the tribe of Judah on the south and the descendants of Joseph on the north.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Their northern border began in the east at the Jordan River and went up the slope north of Jericho and westward through the hill country as far as the desert near the city of Beth Aven.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The border then went to the slope on the south side of Luz (that is, Bethel) then down to Ataroth Addar on the mountain south of Lower Beth Horon.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The border then turned south from the western side of this mountain and went to the city of Kiriath Baal, which is also called Kiriath Jearim, a town of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="15">From the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim, the boundary extended to Mount Ephron and went from there to the fountain of the Waters of Nephtoah.</verse>
				<verse number="16">It continued down to the foot of the mountain on the north side of the Valley of Rephaites, where the Hinnom Valley begins. From there it went south through the Hinnom Valley to the south slope of Jerusalem and then downward to En Rogel.</verse>
				<verse number="17">From there the boundary turned sharply northward to En Shemesh and on to Geliloth, facing the ascent of Adummim, and descended to the Boulder of Bohan, son of Reuben.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then it passed north of the ridge overlooking the Jordan Valley. From there it descended into the valley,</verse>
				<verse number="19">passing north of the ridge of Beth Hoglah. The southern border ended where the Jordan River empties into the Dead Sea.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The eastern border was the Jordan River. The families of the tribe of Benjamin received as their possession the land within these borders.</verse>
				<verse number="21">There were twelve cities, along with the towns around them, which belonged to the tribe of Benjamin: Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, Chephar Ammoni, Ophni, and Geba.</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23"></verse>
				<verse number="24"></verse>
				<verse number="25">There were another fourteen cities, along with the towns around them, which also belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. These cities were Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, Mizpah, Chephirah, Mozah, Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, Zela, Haeleph, Jebus (or Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath. Joshua assigned this land and all these cities to the tribes of Benjamin.</verse>

				<verse number="27"></verse>
				<verse number="28"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">The families of the tribe of Simeon received the second assignment of land, which was located within the territory of Judah.</verse>

				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">In addition, they received four other cities, along with the villages around them: Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Simeon’s territory included all the cities and villages as far south as the town of Baalath Beer, which is also known as Ramah in the Negeb.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The families of Simeon received their inheritance from Judah’s share of land because Judah’s portion exceeded what they needed. So the inheritance of the families of Simeon was within the territory of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The families of the tribe of Zebulun received the third assignment of land. Their boundary reached as far southeast as the city of Sarid.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Going west, it ran to Maralah, touched Dabbesheth, and extended to the stream near Jokneam.</verse>
				<verse number="12">In the other direction, the boundary line went east to the border of Chisloth-Tabor, and from there to Daberath and Japhia;</verse>
				<verse number="13">then it continued east of Gath-Hepher, Eth Kazin, Rimmon, and turned toward Neah.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The northern boundary of Zebulun passed Hannathon and ended at the valley of Iphtah El.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Their land encompassed twelve cities, including Kattath, Nahalal, Shimeon, Iralah, and Bethlehem.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Zebulun’s families inherited all these towns and their villages.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The families of the tribe of Issachar received the fourth assignment of land.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Their inheritance included Jezreel, Kesulloth, Shunem, Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, Remeth, En Gannim, En Haddah, and Beth Pazzez.</verse>

				<verse number="20"></verse>
				<verse number="21"></verse>
				<verse number="22">Their border touched Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh, and ended at the Jordan River—sixteen towns and their villages.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Issachar’s families inherited all these cities and their towns.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The families of the tribe of Asher received the fifth assignment of land.</verse>

				<verse number="26">Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. Their border touched Carmel to the west and Shihor Libnath.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The eastern border went north from the city of Beth Dagon. It touched the territory of the tribe of Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtah El to the north, Beth Emek and Neiel, and extended to Cabul on the north.</verse>
				<verse number="28">It went to Abdon, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The boundary then turned back toward Ramah and went to the fortified city of Tyre, turned toward Hosah and came out at the sea in the region of Achzib,</verse>
				<verse number="30">Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob—twenty-two towns and their villages.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Asher’s families inherited this entire region.</verse>
				<verse number="32">The families of the tribe of Naphtali received the sixth assignment of land.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The northern border of its territory went from the town of Heleph to the oak near the town of Zaanannim, then continued to Adami Nekeb, Jabneel, and on to Lakkum, and ended at the Jordan River.</verse>
				<verse number="34">It turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, extended from there to Hukok, touched Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and the Jordan on the east.</verse>
				<verse number="35">The fortified towns of Naphtali included Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth, Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor, Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh—nineteen towns and their villages.</verse>

				<verse number="47">The Danites had difficulty taking possession of their territory, so they went up and attacked Leshem, took it, killed its inhabitants, and occupied it. Then they renamed the city after their ancestor Dan.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Dan’s families inherited this entire region.</verse>
				<verse number="49">All the people of Israel gathered in front of the tabernacle at Shiloh so that Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and the leaders of the tribes could divide all the land west of the Jordan River. They used lots to find out how Yahweh wanted them to divide the land. When they finished dividing the land into its regions, the Israelites gave their warrior-chief, Joshua son of Nun, his inheritance. As Yahweh had instructed, they gave him the city he requested—Timnath Serah in the Ephraimite hill country. So he built up the city and lived there.</verse>
				<verse number="50"></verse>
				<verse number="51"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh instructed Joshua: “A person who accidentally and unintentionally kills someone will need a place of asylum—a city where he can run for safety. Otherwise, the dead man’s relatives will kill him.” So now Yahweh said to Joshua, “Tell the people of Israel to choose these cities of asylum as I instructed you through Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">The one who has committed manslaughter shall escape for protection to one of these cities and stand at the entrance to the city gates and explain his case to the leaders of the city. The leaders must then receive him into their city and grant him asylum.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When the one looking for revenge comes after him, the leaders of the city must protect him and not hand him over, for he killed the person accidentally and without premeditation.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He must remain in the city until he has had a public trial; then he must remain protected in the city until the man who is high priest at that time has died. Afterward, he may return to his family and his own hometown.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So they dedicated three cities on the west side of the Jordan River: Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they dedicated Bezer in the desert plain belonging to the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh.</verse>
				<verse number="9">These were the designated cities of refuge. Any Israelite or any foreigner living among them who had accidentally killed someone could run to one of these cities for protection. He could live there safely until he had a fair trial, and unless he had been proven guilty, he could not be killed by the one seeking revenge.</verse>

			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">While the people of Israel camped at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, the ancestral heads of the Levites went to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the families of all of the tribes of Israel and said, “ Yahweh instructed through Moses for you to give us cities to live in and pasturelands around the cities for our livestock.”</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">So the people of Israel obeyed Yahweh ’s command and gave the Levites some of their cities and pasturelands from their inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Each clan of the Levites received its cities by drawing lots. First, the people of Israel gave to the descendants of Aaron the priest from the clan of Kohath thirteen cities from the territories of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. They allotted to the rest of the clan of Kohath’s descendants ten towns from the clans of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and half of Manasseh.</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6">By lot, the descendants of Gershon received thirteen cities from the tribe of Issachar, from the tribe of Asher, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Clan by clan, the descendants of Merari received twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad, and the tribe of Zebulun.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh had commanded through Moses to draw lots to see what cities the Levites would receive. So they drew lots, and the people of Israel gave them these cities together with the pasturelands around them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The members of the clan of Kohath, the descendants of Aaron, received nine cities from the tribes of Judah and Simeon.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">They received the city of Hebron, which was also a city of asylum. It lay in the hill country of Judah and was named Kiriath Arba, after Arba the father of Anak. The fields and towns around it had already been given to Caleb, but the city and its pasturelands were now given to the descendants of Aaron. They also received the cities and pasturelands of Libnah, Jattir, Eshtemoa, Holon, Debir, Ain, Juttah, and Beth Shemesh; nine cities from these two tribes.</verse>
				<verse number="12"></verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14"></verse>
				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">They received four cities from the territory of Benjamin: Gibeon, Geba, Anathoth, and Almon, along with the pastureland of each.</verse>
				<verse number="18"></verse>
				<verse number="19">The priests, the descendants of Aaron, received thirteen cities in all, with their pasturelands.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The rest of the Kohathite clans of Levi received four cities with their pasturelands in the territory of Ephraim. One of these cities was Shechem, located in the hill country and one of the cities of asylum. The other three cities were Gezer, Kibzaim, and Beth Horon.</verse>
				<verse number="21"></verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23">The Levites also received four cities from the territory of Dan: Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Aijalon, and Gath Rimmon, along with the pastureland of each.</verse>
				<verse number="24"></verse>
				<verse number="25">They also received two cities from the half-tribe of Manasseh: Taanach and Gath Rimmon, along with the pastureland of each.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The rest of the Kohathite clans received ten towns and their pasturelands.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The Levite clans of the Gershonites received two towns from the half-tribe of Manasseh: Golan in Bashan (a city of asylum for one who committed manslaughter) and Beeshterah, together with their pasturelands.</verse>
				<verse number="28">They received four towns from the tribe of Issachar: Kishion, Daberath, Jarmuth, and En Gannim, together with their pasturelands.</verse>
				<verse number="29"></verse>
				<verse number="30">They received four towns from the tribe of Asher: Mishal, Abdon, Helkath, and Rehob, together with their pasturelands.</verse>
				<verse number="31"></verse>
				<verse number="32">They received three towns from the tribe of Naphtali: Kedesh in Galilee (a city of asylum for one who committed manslaughter), Hammoth Dor, and Kartan, together with their pasturelands.</verse>
				<verse number="33">All the Gershonite clans received thirteen towns, together with their pasturelands.</verse>
				<verse number="34">The remaining Levites of the Merarite clans received four cities from the tribe of Zebulun: Jokneam, Kartah, Dimnah, and Nahalal, along with the pastureland of each.</verse>
				<verse number="35"></verse>
				<verse number="36">They received four cities from the tribe of Reuben: Bezer, Jahaz, Kedemoth, and Mephaath, along with the pastureland of each.</verse>
				<verse number="37"></verse>
				<verse number="38">They received four cities from the tribe of Gad: Ramoth in Gilead (a city of asylum for one who committed manslaughter), Mahanaim, Heshbon, and Jazer, along with the pastureland of each.</verse>
				<verse number="39"></verse>
				<verse number="40">Merarite clans of the remaining Levites received twelve cities in all.</verse>
				<verse number="41">The Levites received from the other tribes of Israel a total of forty-eight cities, each with the pasturelands around them.</verse>
				<verse number="42"></verse>
				<verse number="43">So Yahweh gave Israel all the land he had promised their ancestors. They took possession of the land and settled there.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Yahweh kept his promise and gave them peace in the land just as he had promised to their forefathers. Not one of their enemies could stand against them.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Yahweh didn’t break a single promise that he made to the people of Israel. He faithfully kept every promise he made to them.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">Then Joshua summoned all the men of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh</verse>
				<verse number="2">and said to them, “You have done all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded, and you have obeyed me in everything I commanded.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Through it all, you’ve never deserted your fellow Israelites and were always there to help them. You’ve completed every task given to you by Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yes, he has promised peace to your fellow Israelites, and he has kept that promise. So now, return to the homeland east of the Jordan which Moses, Yahweh ’s servant, assigned to you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Make sure you obey every command and instruction Moses, Yahweh ’s servant, gave you. Love Yahweh! He is your God, so walk in his ways and obey his commands! Cling to him and serve him diligently with all your heart and with all your soul!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then Joshua spoke a blessing over them and sent them on their way, and they settled there.</verse>
				<verse number="7">To one half of the tribe of Manasseh, Moses had assigned land in Bashan. To the other half, Joshua assigned land on the west side of the Jordan with their fellow Israelites. Joshua blessed them and sent them off to their homes</verse>
				<verse number="8">with these words: “You are free to go. You leave for your homes rich—with great herds of cattle, silver and gold, bronze and iron, and a great quantity of clothing! Share with your friends and families everything you took from your enemies.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">So the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh left their fellow Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan and returned to Gilead, their homeland. For Moses had told them before he died, “ Yahweh wants you to take this land for your own.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">On their way home, the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh came to the town of Geliloth near the Jordan River. So they built their own large, impressive altar there.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When the rest of the Israelites heard that the people of the tribe of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh had built an altar at Geliloth at the entrance to the land of Canaan,</verse>
				<verse number="12">they gathered at Shiloh to go to war against them.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The Israelites of the ten western tribes sent a delegation to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh in the land of Gilead. They sent Phineas son of Eleazar the priest, together with ten respected clan leaders, princes from each of their ten tribes.</verse>
				<verse number="14"></verse>
				<verse number="15">So they came to the people in the land of Gilead, to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh. Phineas and the men with him said,</verse>
				<verse number="16">“We speak to you on behalf of all Yahweh ’s people. Why did you rebel against Yahweh and build this altar for yourselves? Why did you quit following the God of Israel and do such an evil thing?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Haven’t we had enough trouble from the terrible sin we committed at Peor? There a plague came upon us even though we belong to Yahweh. To this day, our conscience is stained and we still suffer from our atrocious deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="18">How dare you turn back from following Yahweh! If you rebel against him today, he will be angry with everyone in Israel tomorrow.</verse>
				<verse number="19">If you think your land is defiled, then come back to Yahweh ’s land, where his tabernacle stands at Shiloh. But don’t rebel against Yahweh or us by building for yourself an altar.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Don’t forget what happened to Achan! Yahweh told us, ‘Destroy everything in the city of Jericho.’ But Achan son of Zerah did not obey Yahweh ’s command regarding the devoted things, and so Yahweh punished us all. Achan died because of what he did, and so did many other Israelites because of Achan’s sin.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the princes of the tribes of Israel:</verse>
				<verse number="22">“ Yahweh is the God of all gods! Yahweh is the God of all gods! We appeal to God Almighty as our witness. He knows why we did this, and we want you to know too! If we rebelled or betrayed Yahweh, then you may take our lives today.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But we built this altar with no intention of burning any kind of sacrifices on it. If we built this altar in rebellion against Yahweh or to break our covenant with him, then may Yahweh himself punish us.</verse>
				<verse number="24">No! We love Yahweh! We were afraid that in the future your descendants will say to our descendants, ‘ Who are you? What right do you have to worship Yahweh, the God of Israel? He has placed the Jordan River as a barrier between our people and your people. You Reubenites and Gadites have no part in the worship of Yahweh.’ And your descendants may prevent ours from worshiping him.</verse>
				<verse number="25"></verse>
				<verse number="26">We did build an altar, but not for burning sacrifices or making offerings.</verse>
				<verse number="27">We built this altar to show to our people and to your people and to the generations to come that we will worship Yahweh at his tabernacle. We will bring all our offerings into Yahweh ’s presence there so that your children may never say to our children in the future, ‘You have no part in the worship of Yahweh.’</verse>
				<verse number="28">We have decided among us that if that day should ever come, our descendants would reply: ‘See the replica of the altar of Yahweh, which our fathers made here at the border between us —not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but as a witness that we both serve the same God.’</verse>
				<verse number="29">Far be it from us to rebel against Yahweh or to turn away from following him this day by building an altar on which to present offerings or make sacrifices to Yahweh our God. We would never build an altar to take the place of the altar which stands before his tabernacle, the place of his presence.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">When Phineas the priest, and the princes of the tribes heard the explanation of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh, they were satisfied.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Phineas son of Eleazar the priest said to them, “Now we know that Yahweh is among us! Since you have not rebelled against him, you have indeed saved the Israelites from Yahweh ’s punishment.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then Phineas and the ten princes of the western tribes returned to the land of Canaan and told the people of Israel everything that happened.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The outcome pleased the Israelites and they praised God. They spoke no more of going to war against the eastern tribes to destroy the land where they had lived.</verse>
				<verse number="34">The Reubenites and the Gadites called the altar Witness, for they said, “The altar stands as a witness to us all that Yahweh is God.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="23">
				<verse number="1">Many years had passed since Yahweh had given Israel rest from all their enemies, and Joshua was very old.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So Joshua called together all the Israelites, including all their leaders—elders, judges, and officials—and told them, “I’m now very old and don’t have much longer to live.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh your God has shown you his power and fought against your enemies for you. You have seen all the wonders that he has done to all these nations because he loves you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">See, I have assigned to your tribes all the land from the Jordan River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. I have given you the land of all the nations that we’ve already conquered as an inheritance, and also the land of those nations that we’ve yet to conquer.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yahweh your God will absolutely keep his promises to you. He will drive out all your enemies and make them retreat before you so that you will possess their land.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So be very strong and steadfast; be careful to obey fully what is written in the Scroll of the teaching of Moses, without deviating from it.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Do not intermingle with the nations that are left among you nor speak the names of their gods when you take an oath. And by all means don’t worship or pray to them.</verse>
				<verse number="8">As you have done until now, cling tightly to Yahweh, for he is your God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh has driven out great and powerful nations before you! No one was able to withstand you,</verse>
				<verse number="10">for Yahweh your God fights for you as he promised he would! That is why just one of you causes a thousand of our enemies to run away.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Above all else, keep watch over your hearts, so as to always love Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“But if you ever turn away and make alliances with the nations that remain in your midst, and establish friendly relations with them and intermarry,</verse>
				<verse number="13">then you may be sure that Yahweh your God will no longer drive them out before you. Instead they will become a snare and a trap for you! They will be like whips on your backsides and thorns in your eyes until you perish from the good land that Yahweh your God has given you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Now I am about to go the way of all humanity. You know with all your heart and soul that not one promise of Yahweh your God has failed. Without a doubt, every promise he made to us he has kept; he has fulfilled them all.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Just as he has kept every wonderful promise he ever made to you, so Yahweh your God will carry out every threat and will obliterate you completely from this good land which he has given you.</verse>
				<verse number="16">If you break the covenant our God, Yahweh, made with you and worship other gods and bow down to them, his anger will blaze against you. He will punish you, and he will remove you from the face of this good land he has given you.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="24">
				<verse number="1">Joshua assembled all Israel’s tribes at Shechem. He summoned all the leaders—elders, judges, and officials of Israel—and they all stood in the presence of God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then Joshua said to them all: “This is what Yahweh the God of Israel has to say to you: ‘Long ago, your forefathers—Terah, father of Abraham and father of Nahor—lived beyond the Euphrates and worshiped other gods.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I took your father Abraham from that land and led him through all the land of Canaan. I gave him a son, Isaac, and through Isaac I multiplied his descendants.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I gave Isaac two sons, Jacob and Esau. To Esau and his descendants I gave the hill country of Edom as their inheritance, while Jacob and his family went down to Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When the time of their captivity was complete, I sent Moses and Aaron to Egypt to deliver them. I struck the land with great plagues, and afterward I led you out from there.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I freed your forefathers from Egypt and brought you to the Red Sea, but the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then our people cried out to Yahweh for help, and he put a thick, dark cloud between you and the Egyptians. When the Egyptians attempted to follow them, I caused the sea to roll over them and drown them. You saw with your own eyes what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the desert for many years.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived east of the Jordan. When they fought against you, I gave them into your hands. As you advanced, I gave you victory over them, and you took possession of their land.</verse>
				<verse number="9">‘Later, when Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, opposed Israel, he sent for the prophet Balaam son of Beor to come and curse you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But I refused to listen to Balaam. Instead he had to prophesy my blessings over you! I rescued you from his power.</verse>
				<verse number="11">‘Later, after you crossed the Jordan miraculously, you faced another impossibility —Jericho! The lords of Jericho, as well as the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites, fought with you, but I gave you victory over them all!</verse>
				<verse number="12">I sent the hornet ahead of you to run off the two Amorite kings. Your weapons and strength had nothing to do with it!</verse>
				<verse number="13">I gave you land on which you had not labored and cities that you had not built. You are now living in the land I gave you. You are eating grapes from vines that others planted and olives from trees planted by the people who lived there before you.’</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Now therefore, worship Yahweh with holy awe and serve him in authentic love and loyalty. Remove from your hearts every false god to whom your fathers bowed down beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt and serve Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="15">If it seems wrong in your eyes to serve Yahweh, then make your decision today which gods you will worship—the gods which your ancestors worshiped in Mesopotamia or the gods which the Amorites worship in the land where you are now living—but I and my family, we will give our lives to worship and serve Yahweh!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">The people responded enthusiastically: “Far be it from us to abandon Yahweh and serve other gods!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Our God, Yahweh, set us and our fathers free from slavery in the land of Egypt, the house of bondage. He performed these many great signs and wonders before our eyes. Yahweh supernaturally protected us throughout our entire journey as we passed through the territory of other nations.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And as we advanced, Yahweh powerfully drove out from before us all the people, including the Amorites who inhabited the country. Yes, Joshua! We, too, will worship and serve Yahweh, for he alone is our God.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Joshua warned the people, “Don’t be so quick to say, ‘We will worship and serve Yahweh,’ for he is a holy God. And he will tolerate no rivals. God will not forgive the sin of unfaithfulness to him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">If after Yahweh has been gracious to you, you turn and forsake him to worship other gods, then he will turn and deal harshly with you and totally consume you!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">“No, no!” the people responded. “We promise to worship and serve Yahweh!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then Joshua said to them, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve Yahweh.” “Yes, we are witnesses,” they responded.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“Now then,” said Joshua, “throw away these foreign gods that are among you, and yield your hearts fully to Yahweh the God of Israel!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">And the people promised Joshua, “We really will worship and serve our God, Yahweh, and listen to his voice.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">On that day when the people were gathered at Shechem, Joshua made a covenant between them and Yahweh, which contained laws the people were to obey.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Joshua recorded all this in a book of divine instruction. Then he set up a large stone memorial at the tent pole near the holy place of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Joshua said to all the people, “Look at this stone! It will serve as a witness, for it heard all the words that Yahweh spoke to us; it will be a witness against you if you rebel against our God.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Joshua then dismissed the people, each to their own inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Some time later, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died at the age of one hundred and ten.</verse>
				<verse number="30">They buried him on his own property, at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Israel was faithful to serve Yahweh during the lifetime of Joshua and the lifetime of the elders who lived on after Joshua, those who had experienced all the miracles that Yahweh had done for Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="32">They buried Joseph’s bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the tract of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver from the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father. So the land became the inheritance of Joseph’s descendants.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The chief priest Eleazar son of Aaron also died. They buried him on the hill of his son Phineas, which had been assigned to him in Ephraim.</verse>

		<book number="7">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">And after Joshua died, the twelve tribal leaders consulted Yahweh for a prophetic sign and asked, “Which tribe do you choose to be the first to lead the attack against the Canaanites?”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh answered them, “Let Judah take the lead.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I have delivered the land into their hands.” Judah then enlisted support from their brother-tribe Simeon, saying, “Follow us into our territory and fight with us against the Canaanites; then we will do the same for you.” So the Simeonites agreed and joined them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When Judah advanced, Yahweh gave them victory over the Canaanites and Perizzites, and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They encountered King Adoni-Bezek fleeing with his army on the battlefield. They pursued him, captured him, and defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites. Then they cut off Adoni-Bezek’s thumbs and big toes.</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">Adoni-Bezek confessed, “I once had seventy kings picking up scraps under my table with their thumbs and big toes cut off. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them!” They took him captive to Jerusalem, where he died.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They killed the inhabitants of the city and set it on fire.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Afterward, the men of Judah continued their advance and attacked the Canaanites living in the hill country, the southern desert region, and the western lowlands.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Under Caleb’s leadership, they fought against the Canaanites living in Hebron, formerly known as Kiriath Arba, and killed the three Canaanite families descended from Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>
				<verse number="11">From there, they attacked the city of Debir, formerly known as Kiriath Sepher.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Caleb announced, “I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Caleb’s nephew Othniel the Kenizzite captured Kiriath Sepher; and Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah in marriage.</verse>
				<verse number="14">One day, Othniel nagged her to ask her father for a field as a wedding gift, so she went to him. When she got down from her donkey, Caleb said to her, “What can I do for you?”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Please, give me a blessing,” she replied. “I know you’ve already given me some arid desert land, but please give me a field with springs of water.” So Caleb blessed her with a field that had both upper and lower springs.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, joined the people of Judah, and went with them from Jericho, the City of Date Palms, to the Judean wilderness. The Kenites had settled there among the Amalekites at Arad.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Judah and their brother-tribe Simeon advanced to the city of Zephath and wiped out the Canaanites living there. That’s why they now call the city Hormah.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The men of Judah captured Gaza, Ashkelon, Ekron, and the territories surrounding each of these cities.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yahweh ’s presence and power were with the men of Judah and they were able to conquer the hill country, but because the people of the lowlands had war chariots, they failed to drive them out.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Because Caleb conquered the three giants, the sons of Anak, he was given the city of Hebron.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The tribe of Benjamin, however, failed to conquer the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. So to this day, the Jebusites live among the Benjamites in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Yahweh ’s presence and power were with Joseph’s descendants, so they advanced toward Bethel and sent men ahead to spy out the city that was formerly known as Luz.</verse>
				<verse number="23"></verse>
				<verse number="24">The spies confronted a man coming out of Bethel and they said to him, “Show us the way to enter the city and we will treat you well.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">So he showed the spies a secret entrance into the city, and they killed everyone living in Bethel with the sword except that man and his family.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Later the man and his family moved to the land of the Hittites and built a town. The new town has kept the name Luz to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The Canaanites were determined to stay in their land, so the men of Manasseh did not conquer the cities of Beth Shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and their surrounding villages.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And whenever Israel gained the upper hand, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor; but they did not completely drive them out.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The tribe of Ephraim failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, so the Canaanites continue to live there among them.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The tribe of Zebulun failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol, so the Canaanites continue to live there among them.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The tribe of Asher failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob,</verse>
				<verse number="32">so the people of Asher live among the Canaanites residing in the land because they did not conquer them.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Likewise, the tribe of Naphtali failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath, so they live among the Canaanites residing in the land. However, they forced the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath to serve them.</verse>
				<verse number="34">The tribe of Dan was least successful. The Amorites forced them back into the hills and they could no longer live in the valley.</verse>
				<verse number="35">The Amorites persisted in living on Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. But when the descendants of Joseph grew stronger, they overpowered the Amorites and ruled over them.</verse>
				<verse number="36">The boundary of the Amorites ran from Scorpion Pass to Sela and continued northward from there.</verse>

				<verse number="1">The Angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said to the people: “I rescued you from Egypt and brought you into the land I had promised to your ancestors. I said, ‘I will never, never break my covenant with you,</verse>
				<verse number="2">and you are never, never to make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You must tear down their altars to their false gods!’ But you have not listened to my voice. See what you have done!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Therefore listen to what I’m telling you—I won’t drive them out before you. Instead, they will be thorns in your sides, and their gods will become a trap for you!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">After the Angel of Yahweh had delivered his message to all the Israelites, the people burst out with loud, bitter weeping.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So they named that place Bokim, and in that place of tears they offered sacrifices to Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then Joshua released the people to go take possession of their territorial inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The people faithfully worshiped Yahweh all the days of Joshua and through all the days of the elders who outlived him. They had all experienced the many astounding miracles Yahweh had done for Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh ’s servant, Joshua son of Nun, died at the age of one hundred and ten</verse>
				<verse number="9">and the people buried him on his own parcel of land in the hill country of Ephraim at Timnath Serah, north of Mount Gaash.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Eventually, after that entire generation died and was buried, the next generation forgot Yahweh and all that he had done for Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh and worshiped the images of Baal.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Israel deserted Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, who had rescued them from Egypt. They found new gods to worship—the gods of the people around them. They bowed down to them and provoked Yahweh to anger.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They completely abandoned Yahweh to serve Baal and the images of the goddess Astarte.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They caused the anger of Yahweh to be kindled against Israel, and he handed them over to invaders, who plundered them. He surrendered them to their enemies on all sides, and they could no longer defend themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Every time they went into battle, Yahweh raised his hand against them to their undoing, just as he had warned them, and they were in great distress.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Nevertheless, Yahweh raised up deliverers from among them who rescued them from the marauding bands.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Rather than listen to their deliverers, they prostituted themselves to other gods and bowed down to worship them. This new generation quickly turned from the good path and refused to be like their ancestors who actually listened to Yahweh ’s commands.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Yet, whenever Yahweh raised up a hero for them, his presence and power were with that leader, and he would rescue the people from their enemies as long as that deliverer lived. Yahweh had mercy and pitied them because of their cries of distress and groanings under the grip of their oppressors.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But when their champion died, then the people would relapse into their former idolatry. They would worship other gods, bow down to them, and refuse to give up their evil ways. And each generation behaved worse than the one before it.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then Yahweh became furious with Israel, saying, “Because this nation has violated the covenant that I commanded their fathers to keep, and because they no longer listen to my voice,</verse>
				<verse number="21">I will no longer drive out any of the nations that remained in the land after Joshua died.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Over and over Yahweh tested Israel to see if they would faithfully walk in his ways, as their ancestors had done.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So Yahweh intentionally left pagan nations in the land instead of driving them all out at once, and he did not give Joshua the victory over them, nor did he drive them out after Joshua’s death.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Here is a list of the nations that Yahweh permitted to remain in the land so he could use them to test the Israelites who had not known what it was like during the Canaanite wars.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He wanted the succeeding generations of Israel, who had not known war before, to learn the art of warfare.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So he left in the land the five Philistine principalities and all the Canaanites, Sidonians, and Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal Hermon as far as Lebo Hamath.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They remained in the land to test Israel to see if they would obey Yahweh ’s commands that Moses had given to their ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So the Israelites settled among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons; and the Israelites served their false gods.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The Israelites did what was evil in Yahweh ’s sight. They ignored Yahweh their God, and they served the Baal gods and the Asherah goddesses.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Therefore Yahweh ’s blazing anger rose up against them. He surrendered them to Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Mesopotamia. He kept the Israelites in bondage to him for eight years.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then the Israelites, with shattered hearts, cried out to Yahweh for mercy, and he answered them by raising up a champion-deliverer to rescue them, Othniel. He was Caleb’s nephew, the son of his younger brother Kenaz.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And the Spirit of Yahweh was upon him and empowered him to liberate Israel from bondage. He became Israel’s champion and went out to war, and Yahweh delivered into his hands Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Mesopotamia. Othniel overpowered him,</verse>
				<verse number="11">and after the land had peace for forty years, Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The Israelites again did what was evil in Yahweh ’s sight, and because they did what was offensive to Yahweh, he gave King Eglon of Moab power over Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Eglon formed an alliance with the Ammonites and Amalekites, and they attacked and defeated Israel. Eglon captured Jericho, the City of Date Palms.</verse>
				<verse number="14">King Eglon of Moab kept the Israelites in bondage to him for eighteen years.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the Israelites, with shattered hearts, cried out to Yahweh for mercy, and Yahweh raised up a champion-deliverer to rescue them—Ehud, who was left-handed. He was the son of Gera from the tribe of Benjamin. One day, the Israelites sent him to present tribute to King Eglon of Moab.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Ehud had made for himself a two-edged sword over a foot long, which he strapped under his coat to his right thigh.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He and his entourage came before King Eglon, who was a very fat man, to present the tribute.</verse>
				<verse number="18">After the formal presentation of the tribute, he told the men who accompanied him to go back home.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Ehud went with them part of the way, but he turned back at the carved stones near Gilgal. He returned to Eglon and said, “Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.” The king said to his attendants, “Leave us!” After all the king’s servants had left,</verse>
				<verse number="20">Ehud approached King Eglon while he was sitting alone in his cool upper room and said to him, “I have a message from God for you.” As the king rose from his throne,</verse>
				<verse number="21">Ehud reached beneath his robe with his left hand for the sword strapped to his right thigh, and he plunged it deep into Eglon’s belly!</verse>
				<verse number="22">And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade. Ehud was unable to pull out the sword, and the dung came out.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Stepping out of the king’s upper room into the portico, Ehud shut and locked the doors behind him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">After he had slipped away, the king’s servants came to the doors of the upper room and discovered they were locked. So they told themselves, “He must be on the toilet.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">They waited and waited, but still the king did not emerge. Embarrassed, they finally took their key and unlocked the doors. And when they opened the doors, there was their master sprawled out on the floor, dead!</verse>
				<verse number="26">But Ehud had escaped while they stood there wondering what to do. He fled beyond the carved stones and made it to Seirah.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When he arrived back in the land, he sounded the war trumpet with a loud blast and rallied the people in the hill country of Ephraim. The Israelites went down from the hills to fight against the Moabites with Ehud leading the charge.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Follow me closely,” he said, “and pursue them, for Yahweh has delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands!” So they followed his lead and secured the fords of the Jordan opposite the land of Moab and did not let anyone cross.</verse>
				<verse number="29">In the battle that ensued, they killed nearly ten thousand able-bodied men—brave warriors of Moab, and not one escaped.</verse>
				<verse number="30">On that day, Moab surrendered to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.</verse>
				<verse number="31">After Ehud, God raised up Shamgar son of Anath, who killed six hundred Philistines with nothing but an ox-goad, and Shamgar the deliverer rescued Israel.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">After Ehud died, the Israelites returned to doing evil before the eyes of Yahweh,</verse>
				<verse number="2">so he surrendered them to King Jabin of Canaan, who ruled from Hazor. His army commander Sisera established his base in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jabin had nine hundred chariots with iron-rimmed wheels, and he ruthlessly oppressed Israel for twenty years. Then the Israelites, with shattered hearts, cried out to Yahweh for help.</verse>
				<verse number="4">God raised up Deborah to lead Israel as a champion-deliverer. She was a prophetess and a fiery woman.</verse>
				<verse number="5">She presided as Israel’s judge under the Palm of Deborah, a certain palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came to her for wise decisions.</verse>
				<verse number="6">One day she sent for Barak son of Abinoam from the city of Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, “ Yahweh, the God of Israel, commands you: ‘Go, deploy ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun, and march to Mount Tabor.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will draw Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, to fight against you at the Kishon River. He will have his many chariots and soldiers, but I will give you victory over him.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Barak replied, “I will go if you go with me, but if you don’t go with me, I won’t go either.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Very well,” she answered. “I will go with you, but you will receive no glory in the victory because Yahweh will hand over Sisera to a woman.” So Deborah set off for Kedesh with Barak.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Barak summoned the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand warriors followed him and Deborah also.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now Heber the Kenite migrated away from the other Kenites (the descendants of Hobab, Moses’ father-in-law) and was living close to Kedesh near the oak tree at Zaanannim.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When Sisera found out that Barak son of Abinoam was marching toward Mount Tabor,</verse>
				<verse number="13">he gathered together his nine hundred iron-rimmed chariots and all his soldiers and sent them from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the Kishon River.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Deborah prophesied to Barak, “Today, Yahweh has given you victory over Sisera! Go! Yahweh is marching out before you!” Immediately, Barak charged down from Mount Tabor with his ten thousand warriors.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And Yahweh threw Sisera and his army into confusion before the onslaught of Barak and his men. Sisera and all his chariots and men were overwhelmed. He leaped from his chariot and fled on foot.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Barak pursued the other chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles until Sisera’s whole army was killed by the sword, and only Sisera survived.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He ran for his life to the tent of Jael wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was friendship between King Jabin of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Jael came out of her tent to greet Sisera and said to him, “Come in, my lord, come in here. You have nothing to fear.” As soon as he entered her tent, she hid him under a blanket.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Sisera said to her, “I’m so thirsty. Please let me have some water.” So she opened a skin of milk, gave him some to drink, and covered him again.</verse>
				<verse number="20">He said to her, “Stand at the entrance of your tent. If anybody comes and asks you if there is anybody here, tell them, ‘No.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Exhausted, he fell fast asleep under the blanket. While he slept, Jael wife of Heber took a tent peg in one hand and a hammer in the other and tiptoed over to where he was lying. And with a crushing blow, she drove the tent peg through his temple until it went down into the ground—he was dead!</verse>
				<verse number="22">Just then, Barak arrived in pursuit of Sisera. Jael went out of her tent to greet him and said, “Come, let me show you the man you’re looking for.” He went inside with her, and there was Sisera lying dead with the tent peg through his temple.</verse>
				<verse number="23">On that day God humiliated King Jabin of Canaan before the Israelites.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The hand of the Israelites pressed harder and harder against King Jabin of Canaan until there was nothing left of him but a memory!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this victory song:</verse>
				<verse number="2">Blessings be to Yahweh, who gave us victory today! For the people answered the call, and Israel threw off what once held us back.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Listen, you kings! Open your ears, you princes! For I will sing a song to Yahweh. I will make music to Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yahweh, when you advanced from Seir, and when you marched from Edom’s plains, the earth trembled, the sky poured, the clouds burst,</verse>
				<verse number="5">and the mountains melted, in the presence of Yahweh, the Glorious One of Sinai, in the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="6">In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, and in the days of Jael, no one felt safe; the roads were deserted, and those who dared to travel took back roads.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Champions were hard to find — hard to find in Israel, until I, Deborah, took a stand! I arose as a mother in Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="8">The Israelites chose new gods, which brought war into the land. Of forty thousand men in Israel, not a shield or spear was seen.</verse>
				<verse number="9">My heart is with Israel’s princes, with the people who gladly volunteered. Praise Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Declare it, you rich who ride on your white donkeys, sitting on your fancy saddles! Declare it, you poor who must walk wherever you go!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Listen to the sound of singers at the well, as they proclaim the victories of Yahweh, the righteous triumph of his villagers in Israel! Then the people of Yahweh marched out from their city gates!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Lead on, O Deborah, lead on! Awake, awake! Break out in a song! Arise, O Barak, arise! Son of Abinoam, arise! Carry off your captives and lead them all away!</verse>
				<verse number="13">The remaining nobles marched out, Yahweh ’s people came to me to fight against the mighty ones.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You men of Ephraim came out to the valley, your brother Benjamin joined your ranks. Leaders came from Manasseh, and from Zebulun, those who hold the ruler’s staff.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Issachar’s princes rallied to Deborah, Issachar stood fast alongside Barak, rushing into the valley under Barak’s command, while among Reuben’s clans there was great searching of heart.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Reuben, why do you remain by the sheepfolds, listening for the shepherds to whistle for their flocks? Among Reuben’s clans there was great searching of heart.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Gad played it safe and stayed east of the Jordan, and Dan lingered near their ships, while Asher kept their distance and stayed by the coast, safe and secure in their harbors.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But Zebulun and Naphtali defied death and risked it all on the heights of the battlefield.</verse>
				<verse number="19">At Taanach foreign kings came and clashed; they battled by the stream of Megiddo. The kings of Canaan fought, but they took away no spoils of silver.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Even the stars in the sky joined in the fight, moving across the sky, shining as they fought against Sisera.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The flooding Kishon swept them away— the ancient Kishon River contended with them. I shall march and keep marching on. So be strong, O my soul!</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then thundered the horses’ hooves, pulling the chariots of the kings of Canaan. Here they come galloping on, steeds and stallions stampeding on, but they all got stuck in the mud!</verse>
				<verse number="23">“Speak a curse over Meroz,” says the angel of Yahweh, “and speak a double curse over those who live there. For they did not come to help Yahweh ’s cause nor rally to Yahweh ’s side to fight the mighty.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">The most blessed of all women is Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite— the most fortunate of Bedouin women.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Sisera came to Jael’s tent and asked for water, but she gave him milk; she brought him buttermilk in a beautiful bowl.</verse>
				<verse number="26">With a tent peg in one hand and a workman’s hammer in the other, she struck Sisera and pierced his skull; she drove the peg through his temple.</verse>
				<verse number="27">She shattered his skull, and he lay still before Jael. Sprawled on the tent floor, he bit the dust at her feet— deader than a doornail!</verse>
				<verse number="28">Sisera’s mother waited for him at her window; she gazed from behind the lattice and lamented: “Why is the clatter of his chariot so late in coming? Why are his horses so slow to return?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">The wisest of her princesses replied; indeed, she even thought to herself:</verse>
				<verse number="30">“They must be gathering and dividing the spoils: a slave-girl or two for each man, colorful cloth and garments as plunder for Sisera, two colorful garments, embroidered, and richly embroidered garments for my neck.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Yahweh, may all who hate you perish in the same way! But may those who love you shine like the sun, bright in its strength as it crosses the sky! Then the land had peace for forty years.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Once again the Israelites did evil in the sight of Yahweh, so Yahweh handed them over to the Midianites for seven years.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The crushing power of the Midianites overwhelmed Israel, forcing the Israelites to make hiding places for themselves in caves and mountain strongholds.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Whenever the Israelites planted any crops, and before they could reap the harvest, the Midianites would come with the Amalekites and other desert tribes and invade the land.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They would camp in their fields and destroy their crops as far as Gaza. They would seize all their sheep, cattle, and donkeys. They left nothing for the Israelites to live on.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When they invaded the land with their livestock and camels and tents, they were as numerous as locusts, leaving the land desolate.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Israel was impoverished and helpless against them. Then the Israelites, with shattered hearts, cried out to Yahweh for mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When the Israelites, with shattered hearts, cried out to Yahweh because of the Midianite oppression,</verse>
				<verse number="8">he sent them a prophet with this message: “Listen to the words of Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘I delivered you from Egypt and from a life of slavery.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I snatched you from the brutality of the Egyptians. I rescued you from the people who invaded this land and fought against you. I drove them out as you advanced, and I gave their land to you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I told you that I am Yahweh your God, and that you must not worship the false gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But you did not listen to my voice.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11">The Angel of Yahweh came to the village of Ophrah and sat down under the oak tree that belonged to Joash, a man of the clan of Abiezer. His son Gideon was secretly threshing some wheat in a winepress so that the Midianites would not see him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yahweh ’s Angel suddenly appeared to Gideon and said, “ Yahweh ’s presence goes with you, man of fearless courage!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Me?” Gideon replied. “But sir, if Yahweh is truly with us, why have all these troubles come to us? Where are all his miracle-wonders that our fathers told us about when they said, ‘Did not Yahweh deliver us out of Egypt?’ But now Yahweh has abandoned us and put us under the power of the Midianites.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Yahweh himself faced Gideon directly and said, “Am I not sending you? With my presence you have all you need. Go in the strength that you now have and rescue Israel from Midian’s power!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Gideon said to him, “But Lord, how could I ever rescue Israel? Of all the thousands in Manasseh, my clan is the weakest, and I’m the least qualified in my family.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yahweh replied, “ My presence and my power will be with you. Believe me, Gideon, you will crush the Midianites as easily as if they were only one man!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then Gideon said, “If it’s really true that you will go with me and that I have found grace before your eyes, then show me a miracle-sign to prove that you are really Yahweh speaking with me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Don’t leave until I return with my offering to you.” And he answered, “I’ll wait until you return.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So Gideon went and cooked a young goat and many loaves of unleavened bread. He placed the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot and took his offering and presented it to him under the oak tree.</verse>
				<verse number="20">God’s Angel said to Gideon, “Place the meat and the bread on that rock and pour the broth over them.” And Gideon did so.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then Yahweh ’s Angel reached out the staff he was holding and touched the meat and the bread. All at once, supernatural fire sprang up from the rock and burned up the meat and the bread. Then the Angel of Yahweh vanished from his sight.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Immediately, Gideon realized that he had seen the Angel of Yahweh! Terror stricken, he said, “Oh, Lord Yahweh! I have seen the Angel of Yahweh face-to-face!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">But Yahweh spoke to him and said, “Be at peace. Don’t be afraid. You will not die.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">So Gideon built an altar to Yahweh there and named it “In Yahweh there is Peace.” (The altar is still standing at Ophrah, which belongs to the clan of Abiezer.)</verse>
				<verse number="25">That night, Yahweh spoke to Gideon and said, “Take your father’s bull and the second bull that is seven years old, and go and demolish your father’s altar to Baal. And cut down the tree of the goddess Asherah, which is beside it.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And in their place, on top of the stronghold, build a well-constructed altar to Yahweh your God. Use the Asherah tree you have cut down for firewood. Then take the second bull and burn it whole as an offering.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">So Gideon took ten of his servants and did what Yahweh had told him. Because he feared both his family and the men of the town he did it at night rather than in the daytime.</verse>
				<verse number="28">When the people of the town got up early the next morning, they found the altar to Baal and the symbol of Asherah cut down, and the second bull burned on the new altar that Gideon had built there.</verse>
				<verse number="29">They asked each other, “Who did this?” After investigating thoroughly, they concluded that it was the work of Gideon son of Joash.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Enraged, they demanded of Joash, “Bring your son out here and we will kill him! He tore down the altar to Baal and chopped down the Asherah tree beside it.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">But Joash said to all those who confronted him, “Does Baal need you to fight his battles? Are you really going to rescue him? I will kill anyone who stands up for Baal before morning. If Baal is a god, let him fight his own battles and defend his own altar!”</verse>
				<verse number="32">From then on, Gideon’s nickname was “Jerubbaal,” that is to say, “Let Baal contend against him,” because he broke down his altar.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Now all the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the people of the East formed an army. They crossed the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel to fight against Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then the Spirit of Yahweh clothed himself in Gideon and enveloped him! Gideon sounded a blast of the shofar to call the men of the clan of Abiezer to follow him.</verse>
				<verse number="35">He sent messengers throughout the territory of both parts of Manasseh, and throughout the territory of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali—to call them to follow Gideon into battle. And they all came to join him.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Gideon said to God, “If you have really chosen me to rescue Israel, as you said,</verse>
				<verse number="37">then give me proof. Here—I am placing a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If in the morning the dew is only on the wool but not on the ground around it, then I will know for sure that I’m the one you have chosen to rescue Israel, as you said.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">And that is exactly what happened. When Gideon got up early the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out enough dew to fill a bowl.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Then Gideon said to God, “Don’t be angry with me; let me speak just once more. Please let me ask you for one more sign. This time let the fleece be dry, and the ground wet.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">That night God did what Gideon had asked. The next morning the fleece was dry, but dew covered the ground around it.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Now, the Baal-Fighter (that is, Gideon) and his men rose early and encamped by the Spring of Trembling. The Midianites had encamped in the valley to the north, below Moreh.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh spoke to Gideon: “You have too many in your army. If I give them victory over the Midianites, they might claim credit for themselves at my expense, thinking that they had won the victory on their own.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Announce to your men, ‘All who are trembling and afraid, hurry back home and leave Mount Gilead!’ ” So twenty-two thousand went back home, and only ten thousand stayed with Gideon.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Yahweh spoke to Gideon again, “You still have too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. If I tell you a man should go with you, he will go. If I tell you a man should not go with you, he will not go.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So Gideon brought the soldiers down to the water, and Yahweh said to him, “Separate those who drink from their cupped hands and drink as a dog laps from those who kneel down to drink.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Of the ten thousand men, only three hundred lapped water from their cupped hands; all the others knelt to drink.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then Yahweh told Gideon, “I will give you victory over the Midianites with the three hundred men who cupped their hands and drank. Tell everyone else to go home.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">So Gideon sent all the Israelites home except the three hundred, who kept the supplies and shofars of those who had left. Now the Midianites were camped down below in the valley.</verse>
				<verse number="9">That night Yahweh commanded Gideon, “Get up and attack the camp; I am giving you victory over the Midianites!</verse>
				<verse number="10">But if you are afraid to engage them, first go down to the camp with your servant Purah.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Listen to what they are saying, and then you will be brave and have the courage to attack.” So Gideon and his servant Purah went down and approached the outposts of the enemy camp.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The Midianites, the Amalekites, and the desert tribesmen were spread out in the valley like a swarm of locusts. They had as many camels as there were grains of sand on the seashore.</verse>
				<verse number="13">As soon as Gideon arrived, he heard an enemy soldier telling a friend about a dream. He was saying, “Well, I had a dream of this huge commotion in our camp. I dreamed a round loaf of barley bread came whirling into our camp and leveled a tent. It hit the tent so hard it turned it upside down, and the tent collapsed on the ground.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">His friend interpreted the dream and said, “Your dream symbolizes the sword of the Israelite, Gideon son of Joash! It can’t mean anything else! God has given him victory over Midian and our whole army!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">When Gideon heard about the man’s dream and what it meant, he fell to his knees and worshiped Yahweh. Then he went back to the Israelite camp and shouted, “Come on, it’s time to strike! Yahweh is giving you victory over the Midianite army!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">He divided his three hundred men into three groups and gave each man a shofar and a clay jar hiding a torch inside it.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He told them, “Follow me! When I get to the edge of the camp, watch me closely and do exactly what I do.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When my group and I blow our shofars, then you blow yours all around the camp and shout, ‘For Yahweh and for Gideon!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Just before midnight, after the changing of the Midianite guard, Gideon and his hundred men came to the outskirts of the camp. Then each of the three groups blew the shofars and broke the clay jars that hid the torches inside. They held their torches in their left hands, the shofars in their right, and shouted a thunderous battle cry, “A sword for Yahweh and for Gideon!”</verse>
				<verse number="20"></verse>
				<verse number="21">Each man held his position surrounding the camp. And the entire enemy army was shocked awake by the thunderous noises of Gideon’s army! They all panicked and fled, yelling as they ran away!</verse>
				<verse number="22">When they sounded their three hundred shofars, Yahweh made the enemy troops turn against each other with their own swords. The Midianites fled toward Zarerah as far as Beth Shittah, as far as the outskirts of the town of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Gideon called to arms men from the tribes of Naphtali, Asher, and both parts of Manasseh, and they rallied and pursued the Midianites.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then Gideon sent messengers through the entire hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Join us in the fight against the Midianites. Deny them access to the River Jordan and the streams as far as Beth Barah, and prevent them from crossing over.” The men of Ephraim came together, and they held the River Jordan and the streams as far as Beth Barah.</verse>
				<verse number="25">They captured the two Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeeb. They executed Oreb at Oreb Rock and Zeeb at Zeeb Winepress. While the Ephraimites continued to pursue the Midianites, they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was now east of the Jordan.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">The men of Ephraim got into a heated argument with Gideon and complained to him, “Why didn’t you tell us you were going to fight the Midianites? Why did you do that to us?”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Gideon replied, “What have I accomplished compared to you? What your tribe did is worth so much more than what my whole clan has done.</verse>
				<verse number="3">After all, through the power of God, you killed both Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I done compared with you?” After he said this, they calmed down and were no longer so angry.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Totally exhausted, Gideon and his three hundred men crossed the river Jordan and continued to pursue the enemy.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When they arrived at Succoth, he said to the men of the town, “Please give my men some loaves of bread. They are exhausted, and I am still pursuing the two Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">But the leaders of Succoth replied, “Why should we give any food to your army? You haven’t even captured Zebah and Zalmunna yet.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So Gideon said, “All right! Since you won’t help me, when Yahweh has handed them over to me, I’ll whip you with thorns and briars from the desert!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Gideon went on to Penuel and made the same request of the people there, but the men of Penuel gave him the same reply as the men of Succoth.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So he informed them, “I’ll come back victoriously, and when I do, I will tear your tower down!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor with an army of fifteen thousand men who survived, for one hundred twenty thousand sword-wielding soldiers had already been killed.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Gideon followed the desert trail of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah, surprised the enemy’s army, and ambushed them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The two Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna, escaped, but Gideon pursued and captured them, and terrified what remained of the Midianite army.</verse>
				<verse number="13">While Gideon son of Joash was returning from the battle by way of Heres Pass,</verse>
				<verse number="14">he captured a young man from Succoth and interrogated him. The young man wrote down for Gideon the names of the seventy-seven leading men of Succoth.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then Gideon went to the men of Succoth and said, “You mocked me, refused to help me, and said that you couldn’t give any food to my exhausted army because I had not yet captured Zebah and Zalmunna. Well, here they are!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">As he had promised, Gideon took desert thorns and briars and whipped the leaders of Succoth.</verse>
				<verse number="17">As for Penuel, Gideon tore down its tower and killed the men of that city.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Gideon asked the kings, Zebah and Zalmunna, “What can you tell me about the men you killed at Tabor?” They answered, “They looked just like you. Every one of them looked like the son of a king.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Gideon said, “They were my brothers, my own mother’s sons. I swear, as surely as Yahweh lives, that if you had let them live, I would let you live.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then he turned to Jether, his firstborn son, and said, “Go ahead, kill them now!” But the boy wouldn’t do it. He didn’t draw his sword because he was still only a timid boy.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then Zebah and Zalmunna taunted Gideon, “Come on, kill us yourself. It takes a man to do a man’s job.” So Gideon executed them and plundered the crescent ornaments that hung on the necks of their camels.</verse>
				<verse number="22">After that, the Israelites said to Gideon, “ You’re our war hero! You’re the one who saved us from the Midianites. You be our ruler! Then your son will rule after you, and then your grandson.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Gideon answered, “No. Neither I nor my son will be your ruler. Yahweh is to be your only King.</verse>
				<verse number="24">However, I do have one request,” Gideon added. “Give me all the gold earrings you took from the Midianites.” (It was the custom of the Midianites to wear gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)</verse>
				<verse number="25">The people answered, “Gladly. They’re yours!” They spread out a cloth, and each one placed on it the earrings they had taken as plunder.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Gideon received gold earrings that weighed seventeen hundred shekels, not including the crescent ornaments, necklaces, and fine purple robes of the kings of Midian, nor the ornamental collars taken from the necks of their camels.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Gideon used all this plunder to make a sacred golden ephod. He put it on display in his hometown, Ophrah, and all Israel strayed from Yahweh and gave over their hearts to the golden ephod. It was a seducing snare for Gideon and his family.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So Israel defeated Midian, who never troubled them again. The land had peace for forty years until Gideon died.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Gideon, the Baal-Fighter, son of Joash, returned to his own home and lived there.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Because he had many wives, Gideon fathered seventy sons.</verse>
				<verse number="31">In addition, he took a concubine in Shechem. She bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Gideon son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash, at Ophrah, a town of the clan of Abiezer.</verse>
				<verse number="33">No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again abandoned the true God and worshiped the images of Baal. They made Baal-Berith their god</verse>
				<verse number="34">and no longer remembered Yahweh their God, who had saved them from all their enemies on every side.</verse>
				<verse number="35">The Israelites failed to demonstrate loyal love to the family of Gideon, the Baal-Fighter, for all the good that he had done for them.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Abimelech son of Baal-Fighter (or Gideon) went to his mother’s brothers and to the rest of her clan in Shechem and said to them,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Ask all the leaders of Shechem, ‘Which do you prefer: to have just one man as your ruler or have seventy of Baal-Fighter’s sons rule over you?’ And don’t forget, I’m your own flesh and blood.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">When the brothers repeated these words to the leaders of Shechem, their hearts were drawn to Abimelech, for they said, “He is from our hometown and from our own clan.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">They gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, and Abimelech used it to hire reckless scoundrels to follow him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He went to his father’s home in Ophrah and on one stone executed his seventy brothers, the sons of Baal-Fighter. Jotham, Baal-Fighter’s youngest son, escaped and went into hiding.</verse>
				<verse number="6">All the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the sacred tree at the pillar in Shechem and crowned Abimelech king.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When Jotham learned about this, he climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted: “Listen to me, citizens of Shechem, so that God may listen to you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All the trees one day determined to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Be our king.’</verse>
				<verse number="9">“But the olive tree answered, ‘What? Give up my rich oil that is used to honor both gods and men, to hold sway over the trees?’</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Next, the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and be our king.’</verse>
				<verse number="11">“But the fig tree replied, ‘What? Give up my good, sweet fruit to hold sway over the trees?’</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Then the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and be our king.’</verse>
				<verse number="13">“But the vine answered, ‘What? Give up my wine, which cheers both gods and men, to hold sway over the trees?’</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Finally, all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘Come and be our king.’</verse>
				<verse number="15">“The thornbush replied, ‘If you really want to anoint me your king, then come and put your trust in my shade. If you don’t, then let fire blaze out of my thorny branches and consume the cedars of Lebanon!’</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Now then let me ask you this: Do you really think you did a right and honorable thing when you made Abimelech king? Do you think you treated Baal-Fighter and his family fairly?</verse>
				<verse number="17">And to think that my father fought for you, and risked his life to save you from the power of the Midianites!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Today, you have revolted against my father’s family, murdered his seventy sons on a single stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his slave girl, king over the citizens of Shechem because he’s your close relative.</verse>
				<verse number="19">What were you thinking? If you have acted honorably and done what is right by Baal-Fighter and his family today, then may you enjoy Abimelech, this thornbush king of yours, and may he enjoy you too!</verse>
				<verse number="20">But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume you, citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and let fire come out from you, citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and consume Abimelech!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">After shouting these words, Jotham ran away and went to live at the Well because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech.</verse>
				<verse number="22">After Abimelech had ruled Israel for three years,</verse>
				<verse number="23">God sent a spirit to stir up hostility between Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem, and they rebelled against him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">God sent this judgment in order to avenge the brutal murder of Baal-Fighter’s seventy sons and the shedding of their blood. Righteous retribution caught up with both Abimelech, who had instigated the murder of his half brothers, and the citizens of Shechem, who had aided and abetted him.</verse>
				<verse number="25">In their uprising against Abimelech, the citizens of Shechem placed bandits on the hilltops to ambush and rob everyone who passed by, and Abimelech heard of their treachery.</verse>
				<verse number="26">One day, a man named Gaal son of Ebed moved with his clan into Shechem, and Gaal won the confidence of the people.</verse>
				<verse number="27">After the grape harvest, they trod the grapes and celebrated a festival in the temple of Baal, their god. While they were drinking and feasting, they cursed Abimelech.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Gaal son of Ebed rose and said, “Who is this Abimelech? We are the Shechemites now! Why should we serve him? Isn’t he Baal-Fighter’s son, and isn’t the governor of our city Zebul his deputy? Why should we take orders from him; we are descendants of Hamor, Shechem’s founder. Why should we be slaves of Abimelech?</verse>
				<verse number="29">If only the people of Shechem were under my command, then I would get rid of him. I would say to Abimelech, ‘Assemble your whole army! We’ll defeat them all! ’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Zebul, the governor of the city, was infuriated when he heard of the taunts of Gaal son of Ebed.</verse>
				<verse number="31">He secretly sent messengers to Abimelech, saying, “Gaal son of Ebed and his clan have come to Shechem. They’re inciting the entire city against you.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Now then, under the cover of darkness, you and your men should come and take up concealed positions in the fields.</verse>
				<verse number="33">At sunrise launch your surprise attack and advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out to face you, fight them with all of your might.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">So Abimelech and all his men set out by night and took up concealed positions near Shechem in four groups.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city just as Abimelech and his soldiers got up from their hiding places.</verse>
				<verse number="36">When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, “Look, an army is marching down from the hilltops!” Zebul replied, “That’s nothing but shadows in the hills; they only look like men.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Gaal spoke up again: “No, look! I see people coming down the center, and another group from the direction of Oracle Oak.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then Zebul said to him, “Where is all your big talk now? Weren’t you the loudmouth who said, ‘Who is Abimelech that he could make us his slaves?’ The men you ridiculed are now coming to fight you! Go ahead—go and fight them!”</verse>
				<verse number="39">So Gaal led the men of Shechem and went out to fight Abimelech.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Abimelech chased him, and many Shechemites fell wounded and died before they could retreat to the city gate.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Abimelech returned to his headquarters at Arumah, while Zebul drove Gaal and his clan out of Shechem.</verse>
				<verse number="42">The next day Abimelech found out that the people of Shechem were planning to go out on a foray into the countryside.</verse>
				<verse number="43">So he divided his men into three groups, and they set out to ambush the Shechemites in the fields. As soon as Abimelech saw the people leaving the city, he sprang up and attacked them.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Abimelech and his men advanced rapidly and occupied the city gate. The other two companies chased them down out into the open fields and killed them.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Abimelech fought hard all day at the gate of Shechem until he had captured the city. He massacred all its people, leveled the city to rubble, and scattered salt over it.</verse>
				<verse number="46">When they heard the news, the leading citizens living in the Shechem Tower ran into the stronghold of the temple of Baal-Berith.</verse>
				<verse number="47">When Abimelech heard that they had assembled there,</verse>
				<verse number="48">he and all his forces went up Mount Zalmon. Taking an axe in his hand, he cut off some branches and hoisted the bundle onto his shoulders. He ordered the men with him, “Quick! Do the same!”</verse>
				<verse number="49">So each one cut a bundle of branches and followed Abimelech. They piled them against the walls of the temple and with the people inside they set it on fire. So everyone who fled into the tower of Shechem died; nearly a thousand men and women perished.</verse>
				<verse number="50">Next, Abimelech attacked the city of Thebez and captured it.</verse>
				<verse number="51">All the people had fled to the Tower of Strength in the middle of the city. They locked themselves in and climbed up onto the tower roof.</verse>
				<verse number="52">Abimelech advanced as far as the tower, stormed it, and set it on fire.</verse>
				<verse number="53">But a woman dropped a millstone on his head and fractured his skull.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Abimelech cried out to his armor-bearer, “Kill me with your sword so no one can say I was killed by a woman.” So his servant ran him through, and he died.</verse>
				<verse number="55">When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, everyone went home.</verse>
				<verse number="56">God avenged the evil that Abimelech had done to his father by murdering his seventy brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="57">God also punished the Shechemites for all their wickedness. That day, the curse of Jotham son of Baal-Fighter was fulfilled.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">After Abimelech died, Yahweh raised up a man of Issachar’s tribe to deliver Israel. His name was Tola son of Puah and grandson of Dodo. He lived in the village of Shamir in the highlands of Ephraim.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He was Israel’s champion-deliverer for twenty-three years; then he died and was buried at Shamir.</verse>
				<verse number="3">After Tola, Yahweh raised up a man from Gilead whose name was Jair. He was Israel’s champion-deliverer for twenty-two years.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He had thirty sons, who rode on thirty donkeys, and thirty villages belonged to them. These villages are in the region of Gilead and are called Jair’s Villages to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Jair died and was buried at Kamon.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The Israelites again did evil in the sight of Yahweh, worshiping the Baals and the Ashtaroths, the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab, and Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. Because Israel entirely abandoned the worship of Yahweh,</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yahweh became furious with Israel, and he handed them over to the oppression of the Philistines and the Ammonites.</verse>
				<verse number="8">They crushed and oppressed all the Israelites for eighteen years. They ruled over all the Israelites living east of the Jordan in Gilead, in the land of the Amorites.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan and fought against the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim, leaving Israel distressed.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then the Israelites desperately cried out to Yahweh, “We have sinned against you because we have abandoned our God and have worshiped the Baals.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh answered them, “Did I not rescue you in the past from the power of the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines,</verse>
				<verse number="12">the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Midianites? When they swept over you and oppressed you and when you cried out in desperation to me, did I not deliver you and set you free from their power?</verse>
				<verse number="13">Because you have abandoned me to serve false gods, I am no longer coming to your rescue!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Go ahead and pray all you want to these new gods you have chosen. Let’s see if they will come and deliver you in your time of trouble!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">But the Israelites continued to plead with Yahweh, “Rescue us! We know we are guilty. You can do to us whatever seems good to you, but please, come to our rescue!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So they threw away the false gods from among them and returned to worshiping Yahweh. At last, Yahweh felt Israel’s misery and could bear it no longer.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then the Ammonites mustered an army and encamped in Gilead, while the Israelites rallied together, and they encamped at Mizpah.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The commanders of the people of Gilead said to one another, “Whoever starts the fight against the Ammonites, we’ll make him our leader.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh raised up a brave, fearless champion from Gilead to deliver Israel. His name was Jephthah, and he was the son of a prostitute. His father Gilead</verse>
				<verse number="2">had other sons by his wife, and when they grew up, they forced Jephthah to leave home. They said to him, “You will inherit nothing of our father’s wealth because you are the son of another woman.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jephthah fled from his half brothers and lived in the land of Tob. There he recruited a gang of lawless mercenaries who traveled around with him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Sometime later, the Ammonites waged war against Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When they attacked Israel, the leaders of Gilead went to the land of Tob to find Jephthah and to bring him back from exile.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Swallowing their pride, they said to him, “Come and lead us so that we can fight the Ammonites.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jephthah answered, “You’re the very people who hated me so much that you kicked me out of my father’s house. Why are you coming to me now that you’re in trouble?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">They said to Jephthah, “We’re turning to you now because we want you to lead us in battle. Come and fight the Ammonites. You’re the one we need! ”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jephthah said to them, “ Very well. If you take me back home to fight the Ammonites and Yahweh gives me victory, then you will make me your ruler. Agreed?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“That’s right,” they replied. “With Yahweh as our witness, we pledge our loyalty to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So Jephthah returned home with the leaders of Gilead, and the people made him their commander and ruler. Jephthah stated his terms in a solemn ceremony at Mizpah in the presence of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon to ask, “What is your quarrel with us? Why have you invaded our country?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">The king of Ammon answered Jephthah’s messengers, “When the Israelites came out of Egypt, they seized my land from the River Arnon to the River Jabbok, as far as the River Jordan. Now give it all back, and we’ll be at peace.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Jephthah again sent messengers back to the king of Ammon</verse>
				<verse number="15">with this answer: “Israel seized neither the land of Moab nor the land of Ammon.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When the Israelites left Egypt, they passed through the desert to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.</verse>
				<verse number="17">They sent messengers to the king of Edom requesting permission to go through his land, but the king of Edom refused. They also asked the king of Moab, but he too would not cooperate. So the Israelites were forced to remain at Kadesh.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Leaving from there, they traveled through the desert in order to bypass the land of Edom and the land of Moab. When they arrived at the east side of Moab, on the other side of the River Arnon, they made camp there, but they did not cross the Arnon because it was Moab’s boundary.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then, the Israelites dispatched messengers to Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, and requested his permission to go through his country to their own land.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Because Sihon did not trust Israel, he assembled his whole army, made camp at Jahaz, and attacked Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But Yahweh, the mighty God of Israel, gave the Israelites victory over Sihon and his army. So the Israelites took possession of all the territory of the Amorites who lived in that land.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then they occupied all the Amorite territory from the Arnon in the south to the Jabbok in the north and from the desert in the east to the Jordan in the west.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Since it was Yahweh the mighty God of Israel who drove out the Amorites for his people, the Israelites,</verse>
				<verse number="24">who do you think you are to try to take it back? You should be satisfied with whatever land your god Chemosh has won for himself, but we are going to keep everything that Yahweh our mighty God has given us.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Do you think you’re stronger than Moab’s king Balak son of Zippor? He never challenged Israel over disputed land, did he? Did he ever go to war against us?</verse>
				<verse number="26">For three hundred years, Israel has been living here and occupying Heshbon, Aroer, and the towns around them, and all the cities on the banks of the Arnon River. Why have you waited until now to try to take them back?</verse>
				<verse number="27">No, I have not wronged you; rather, you are doing me wrong by attacking me. Let Yahweh be the judge, and let him decide today which of us is right, Israel or Ammon.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">But the king of Ammon ignored Jephthah’s message.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon Jephthah and empowered him. He and his men marched through Gilead and Manasseh and returned to Mizpah in Gilead, and from there, he stalked the Ammonites.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Jephthah promised Yahweh: “If you give me victory over the Ammonites,</verse>
				<verse number="31">I will offer up to you as a burnt offering the first thing that comes out of my house to greet me when I return in victory. I will sacrifice that one as an offering to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">So Jephthah crossed the river with his men to fight the Ammonites, and Yahweh gave him victory.</verse>
				<verse number="33">He struck at them from Aroer to the area near Minnith, twenty villages in all, and as far as Abel Keramim. The Israelites brought the Ammonites down to the dust in a great slaughter.</verse>
				<verse number="34">When Jephthah arrived home at Mizpah, his daughter came hurrying out of the house to welcome her father home, dancing to the rhythm of tambourines. She was his only child—his one and only.</verse>
				<verse number="35">When he realized who had come out, he ripped his cloak and was overcome with grief. He exclaimed, “Oh no! My dearest daughter, you have torn my heart to shreds! Must it be you I offer? I have made a solemn promise to Yahweh, and I cannot retract it!”</verse>
				<verse number="36">She said to him, “My father, you have made a vow to Yahweh and he has delivered you from your enemies, the Ammonites. Do to me what you promised him you would do.</verse>
				<verse number="37">But please grant me one thing. Spare me for two months and let me go with my friends to grieve. Let me be free to wander on the hills and to lament my sad fate.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">“Go,” he replied, and he sent her away for two months. She and her friends went into the mountains and grieved because she was going to die unmarried and childless.</verse>
				<verse number="39">After two months, she returned to her father, and Jephthah fulfilled his vow to Yahweh. His daughter died still a virgin. (This was the origin of the custom in Israel</verse>
				<verse number="40">that young women would go away each year to grieve and lament for the daughter of Jephthah of Gilead.)</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Jephthah’s actions grievously offended the men of Ephraim. They assembled their forces and crossed the Jordan River to Zaphon to confront Jephthah. They said to him, “Why did you cross the border to fight the Ammonites without inviting us to join you? We’re going to burn your house down over your head!”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Jephthah replied, “I and my people were in the middle of a serious conflict with the Ammonites. I summoned you, but you ignored me.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When I realized that you were not coming to help us, I risked my own life to cross the border to fight them. Yahweh empowered me to be victorious over them. So why are you coming to fight with me now?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought the men of Ephraim. The men of Gilead defeated them, for the Ephraimites insulted them, saying, “You men of Gilead are nothing but renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">In order to keep the Ephraimites from escaping, the men of Gilead captured the places where they could cross the Jordan. When any Ephraimite tried to escape and asked permission to cross the river, the men of Gilead would ask, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,”</verse>
				<verse number="6">they would tell him to say “Shibboleth.” But if he could not pronounce it correctly and said “Sibboleth,” the men of Gilead would seize him and kill him there at the crossing place of the Jordan. At that time, they killed forty-two thousand Ephraimites.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jephthah ruled Israel for six years. When he died, they buried him in his hometown in Gilead.</verse>
				<verse number="8">After Jephthah, Yahweh raised up Ibzan, a champion-deliverer from Bethlehem who ruled Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his thirty daughters in marriage outside his tribe and brought thirty women from outside the tribe as wives for his sons. Ibzan ruled Israel for seven years.</verse>
				<verse number="10">When he died, they buried him at Bethlehem.</verse>
				<verse number="11">After Ibzan, Yahweh raised up Elon, a champion-deliverer from Zebulun, who ruled Israel for ten years.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When he died, they buried him at Aijalon in the territory of Zebulun.</verse>
				<verse number="13">After Elon, Yahweh raised up Abdon son of Hillel, a champion-deliverer from Pirathon, to rule Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. Abdon led Israel for eight years.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When he died, they buried him at Pirathon in the territory of Ephraim in the hill country of the Amalekites.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Once again, the Israelites continued doing evil in the sight of Yahweh, so he subjected them to Philistine rule for forty years.</verse>
				<verse number="2">There was a certain man from the tribe of Dan, who lived in the city of Zorah, named Manoah. His wife was barren and childless,</verse>
				<verse number="3">but the Angel of Yahweh appeared to her and said, “Look here! You are no longer barren and childless, for you will conceive and give birth to a son.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now be careful not to drink any wine or beer and to eat nothing considered unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You will conceive and will give birth to a son. Raise the boy as one dedicated to God from the womb and never cut his hair. He will begin to deliver Israel from Philistine power.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So Manoah’s wife went to her husband and said, “A man sent from God came to me! He looked like an angel of God—incredibly awesome. I didn’t ask where he came from, and he didn’t tell me his name,</verse>
				<verse number="7">but he told me, ‘You will become pregnant, and you will have a son. Make sure you don’t drink any wine or beer, and eat nothing unclean, for the boy will be fully devoted to God from the womb to the day he dies!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Manoah pleaded with Yahweh, “O my Lord, please send the man of God back to us. Have him come to instruct us how to raise the son who is to be born.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">God answered Manoah’s prayer and sent the Angel of God to the woman again while she was sitting alone in the field. Her husband Manoah was not with her</verse>
				<verse number="10">so she ran at once to tell him the news: “Look! Come quickly! He reappeared—the same man who came to me that day!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So Manoah got up, followed his wife, and went to the man. Manoah said to him, “Are you the man who appeared and spoke to my wife?” “I am,” he said.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Manoah replied, “Well, when Yahweh fulfills your prophecy, how should we raise the boy, and what is his life mission?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">The Angel of Yahweh answered, “Do everything that I instructed your wife.</verse>
				<verse number="14">She must abstain from anything that comes from the grapevine and drink no alcohol, nor should she eat anything unclean. She must do all that I have commanded her.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Manoah said to the Angel of Yahweh, “Please stay here until we cook a young goat for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">The Angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, “Even if you detain me, I will not eat your food. But if you want to prepare a burnt offering, offer it up to Yahweh.” Manoah did not realize that he was speaking with the Angel of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Stunned, Manoah asked the Angel of Yahweh. “What is your name? When Yahweh fulfills your prophecy, we want to honor you!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">The Angel of Yahweh replied, “Why ask for my name? It is ‘Wonderfully Hidden!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So Manoah prepared the young goat and his grain offering and took them to the rock to offer them up to Yahweh, the wonder-working God. While Manoah and his wife watched,</verse>
				<verse number="20">flames burst from the rock and ascended upward to heaven from the altar. The Angel of Yahweh, wrapped in the flames of fire, ascended into the sky. Dazed, Manoah and his wife fell facedown to the ground in worship.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Only then did Manoah realize that he had met the Angel of Yahweh! He turned to his wife and said, “We’re as good as dead! God has just visited us!” But his wife said, “If Yahweh had planned to kill us, he wouldn’t have accepted our burnt offering and our grain offering. He wouldn’t have revealed all these things to us or have spoken to us as he did just now.” And Manoah and his wife never encountered Yahweh ’s Angel again.</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23"></verse>
				<verse number="24">Manoah’s wife gave birth to a son, and she named him Samson. The boy grew up with Yahweh ’s blessing on his life.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The Spirit of Yahweh began to stir his heart while he was between Zorah and Eshtaol, in the Camp of Dan.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">One day Samson went down to Timnah where a Philistine girl caught his eye,</verse>
				<verse number="2">so he returned home and told his parents, “At Timnah I noticed a young woman among the daughters of the Philistines; get her for me now to be my wife.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">His parents replied, “Why can’t you find a woman from among our relatives, or at least from our tribe? You don’t have to get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines.” But Samson told his father, “Get her for me; I know she’s the right one for me.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now, his parents had no idea that Samson’s passion for the girl was part of Yahweh ’s plan to create an opportunity to come against the Philistines who ruled over Israel at that time.</verse>
				<verse number="5">One day, Samson decided to go back to Timnah to visit the Philistine woman. As he was approaching the vineyards of Timnah, a full-grown lion suddenly came roaring toward him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The Spirit of Yahweh entered Samson and empowered him to tear the lion to pieces with his bare hands as if it were a young goat! But he never disclosed to his father and mother what he had done.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Afterward, he went into Timnah and talked with the Philistine woman, because Samson was convinced that she was the right one for him.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Later, Samson returned to marry her. On his way there, he turned aside to look at the lion’s remains, and to his surprise, there was a swarm of bees, honey, and honeycomb in the carcass of the lion!</verse>
				<verse number="9">He scooped some of the honey into his hands and continued on his way, eating as he went. When he rejoined his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they ate too. But he did not tell them he had scooped it from the lion’s carcass.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So Samson’s father accompanied him to Timnah to arrange the marriage. Following the custom for young men about to marry, Samson threw a party that lasted for seven days.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When the Philistines saw him, they arranged for thirty Philistine men to accompany him as groomsmen.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Samson challenged them with a riddle, “Hey, I have a riddle for you. If you can solve my riddle within the seven days of our feast, then I will give each of you a linen garment and a set of fine clothing.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But if you cannot solve it, then you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of fine clothing.” “Ask away,” they said to him. “Let’s hear your riddle.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">He said to them: “From the eater came something to eat, From the strong came something sweet.” After three days, they were still stumped and could not figure it out.</verse>
				<verse number="15">On the fourth day, they said to Samson’s bride, “Have you invited us here to bankrupt us? Do whatever it takes to persuade your husband to tell you the answer to his riddle, or we will burn down your father’s house with you and your family inside!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So Samson’s bride went to him and turned on the tears and sobbed, “Honey, you don’t really love me! You hate me! You’ve challenged my countrymen with a riddle, but you haven’t told me its meaning!” “Listen,” he said to her. “I haven’t even told my parents. So why should I tell you?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">She continued to cry on his shoulder for the remaining days of their feast, and on the seventh day, because she had so persistently nagged him, he finally gave in and divulged the secret. Then she went and explained the riddle to her countrymen.</verse>
				<verse number="18">On the seventh day before the sun had set, the townsmen answered him: “What could be sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?” And Samson angrily replied, “If you hadn’t used my cow for your plow you wouldn’t know my riddle now!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then suddenly, the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon Samson, infusing him with power! He went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of their men. He stripped them of their linen tunics and their robes and gave them in payment to those who had explained the riddle. Then, in a blazing fury, he returned to his father’s house.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Meanwhile, unknown to Samson, his bride married his best man.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Later, during the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife and took a young goat as a gift for her. He said to her father, “I’m going into my wife’s bedroom to sleep with her.” But her father wouldn’t let him enter. He said to Samson,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“I thought you really despised her and had divorced her, so I gave her to your best man. Look, her younger sister is even more beautiful than she. Take her instead.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Samson said, “That does it! This time I’ll settle my score with you Philistines for good!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Samson went out and caught three hundred foxes, tied their tails together in pairs, and lashed a torch between each pair of tails.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He lit the torches and set the foxes loose in the grain fields of the Philistines, burning all their grain to the ground, including the sheaves and the standing grain, as well as their vineyards and olive groves.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Who did this?” the Philistines demanded. “Samson,” someone told them, “because his father-in-law from Timnah gave Samson’s bride to his best man.” So the Philistines went and burned both the woman and her father to death.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Because you did this despicable act,” Samson vowed, “I won’t rest until I get even with you!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">He was so furious that he launched a vicious attack on the Philistines and single handedly slaughtered many of them. Afterward, he went and hid in a cave in the cliff of Etam.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The Philistines retaliated by setting up camp in Judah and deploying their men near the town of Lehi.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The men of Judah asked the Philistines, “Why are you coming against us?” The Philistines replied, “We’ve come to capture Samson and repay him for what he did to us.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So three thousand men of Judah went to Samson’s cave in the cliff of Etam, and they said to him, “What are you trying to do to us? Don’t you realize the Philistines rule over us?” Samson replied, “I only did to them what they did to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">The men of Judah told him, “We’ve come to take you prisoner and hand you over to the Philistines.” “All right,” Samson said, “but promise me that you won’t kill me.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“We promise not to kill you,” they replied. “We’ll only tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.” They bound him with two brand new ropes and led him from the cave near the cliff of Etam to Lehi.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When the Philistines saw Samson coming, they raised a shout of triumph. Immediately, the mighty Spirit of Yahweh came rushing upon Samson! He snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were strings catching fire, and they fell from his wrists.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He spotted a raw jawbone of a donkey lying there on the ground and picked it up. He began to swing it wildly and used it to kill a thousand Philistines that day.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Samson then said, “With only a donkey’s jawbone, I made heaps of donkeys out of them! With only a donkey’s jawbone, a thousand men lie slain!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">When he finished boasting, he threw the jawbone to the ground. That’s how the place got its name—Jawbone Hill.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Afterward, Samson was terribly thirsty and cried out to Yahweh, “I was strengthened by your great power to win this awesome victory. Will you now leave me here dying of thirst—and let me fall into the hands of these pagans?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So God answered Samson’s prayer and split open the rock basin under Lehi, and water gushed out! Samson drank and his spirit was revived. He named that place “The Spring for the One Who Cried,” and it is still there in Lehi to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Samson led Israel as its champion-deliverer for twenty years during the period of Philistine oppression.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">One day, Samson went to Gaza, a Philistine town, and slept with a prostitute there.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Word soon spread that Samson was in town, so the men of Gaza gathered and hid at the town gates, cutting off his escape. They made no move during the night, saying, “We’ll kill him at dawn when he tries to leave.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">But in the middle of the night, Samson got up and left. On his way out of Gaza, he took hold of the doors of the town gate and ripped them off their hinges—two posts, the gates, and the locking bar. He hoisted them all on his shoulders and carried them off a great distance to the top of the hill across from Hebron.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Some time later Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah from the Sorek Valley.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The rulers of the Philistines went to her with a plan: “Trick Samson into telling you the secret of his great strength. Find out how we can subdue him. We’ll tie him up and make him helpless. Then each of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So Delilah approached Samson and asked, “Please dear, won’t you tell me the secret of your strength and how you could be tied up and made helpless?”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Samson replied, “If someone bound me with seven new bowstrings that haven’t been dried, I’ll become as weak as an ordinary man.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">So the Philistine tyrants brought Delilah seven new bowstrings, and she tied Samson up with them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">With men waiting in ambush in one of the inner rooms of her house, she cried out, “Samson! The Philistines are here to capture you!” But Samson snapped the bowstrings like a piece of string snaps when it is burned by a fire. So no one discovered the secret of his strength.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Afterward, Delilah said to him, “You’ve made fun of me and told me lies! Please tell me how you can be tied up securely.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Samson replied, “If someone bound me with brand-new ropes that have never been used, I’ll become as weak as anyone else.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up with them, and the men were waiting in ambush in the inner room as before. Delilah cried out, “Samson! The Philistines are here to capture you!” Once again, Samson easily snapped the ropes from his arms like they were threads.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Delilah reprimanded him, saying, “You’ve made a fool of me and lied to me again! Now tell me the truth—how can you be tied up?” Samson replied, “If you weave the seven braids of my hair into the fabric on your loom and tighten it with the pin, I’ll become as weak as anyone else.” So while he slept, Delilah wove the seven braids of his hair into the fabric</verse>
				<verse number="14">and pinned it with a peg. Again she cried out, “Samson! The Philistines are here to capture you!” But Samson woke up and yanked his hair from both the loom and the fabric.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“How can you say, ‘I love you,’ ” pouted Delilah, “and yet you don’t tell me your secrets? You’ve tricked me three times now, and you still haven’t told me what makes you so strong!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">She tormented him day after day until he was sick to death of her nagging.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Finally, he confessed to her everything: “I’ve never had my hair cut, because my parents dedicated me to God from birth. If anyone cuts my hair, my power will leave me, and I’ll become as weak as anyone else.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">When Delilah realized he had finally disclosed his secret, she sent for the Philistine rulers. “Come quickly!” she said. “He’s finally told me his secret!” So the Philistine rulers returned with the bribe money in their hands.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Delilah lulled Samson to sleep with his head in her lap. Then she called in a barber to cut off the seven locks of his hair. In this way she weakened him, and his strength drained from him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then she cried out, “Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!” He woke up and thought, “I’ll do the same as before and shake myself free.” But he didn’t realize that Yahweh had turned away from him.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So the Philistines captured him and gouged out his eyes. They took him down to Gaza, where they bound him with bronze chains and forced him to grind grain in the prison.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But before long, his hair began to grow back.</verse>
				<verse number="23">One day, the Philistine tyrants celebrated a great festival to offer extravagant sacrifices to their god, Dagon. They praised Dagon, saying, “Our god has given us victory! Dagon has subdued our strong enemy Samson!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">When the people saw their idol, they too joined in the praises, saying, “Our god has delivered our enemy to us! The one who devastated our country and piled our corpses high!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">By now, the people were getting drunk and demanded, “Bring out Samson and let him dance for us!” So he was brought from the prison to amuse them, and they displayed him between the main pillars that supported their temple.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Blind Samson said to the young servant who was leading him by the hand, “Let go of me and let me feel the pillars that hold up the temple. I want to lean against them.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">The temple was completely packed with people. All the Philistine rulers were there, and there were some three thousand men and women in the balcony watching as Samson provided them some amusement.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then Samson prayed to Yahweh, “Lord Yahweh, please remember me again. O God, impart your strength to me just one more time. With one blow let me take revenge on the Philistines for gouging out my eyes.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then Samson reached toward the two center pillars that held up the temple, his left hand on one and his right hand on the other, and he prayed, “Let me die with the Philistines.” Then with all his might, with both hands he pushed against the pillars, and the temple came crashing down on the Philistine rulers and all the people. So Samson killed more enemies through his death than in his entire lifetime.</verse>
				<verse number="30"></verse>
				<verse number="31">Then his brothers and entire family went down to Gaza to get his body. They brought him back home and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol, next to his father, Manoah. Samson had led Israel for twenty years.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">There was a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He said to his mother, “When someone stole your eleven hundred shekels of silver, I overheard you speak a curse over the thief. Well, it turns out, I have the money. I’m the one who took it. Here—I’m bringing it back.” Immediately, his mother, wanting to revoke her curse, said: “O my son! May Yahweh bless you!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, but she said to him, “I give it back to you, for I solemnly dedicate this silver to Yahweh for my son to make a carved image, an idol covered with silver.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So from the silver he returned to his mother, she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who molded them into an idol and overlaid the idol with silver. Micah kept the idol in his house.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now Micah had a shrine, and he made some idols and a counterfeit ephod and ordained one of his sons as his priest.</verse>
				<verse number="6">In those days, Israel had no king. People did whatever they wanted to do.</verse>
				<verse number="7">At the same time, there was a young man from the priestly tribe of Levi living in Bethlehem in Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He left there to search for another place to live. On his journey, he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Micah asked him, “Where are you from?” “I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,” he said, “and I’m looking for a place to live.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Live here with me,” Micah said to him. “Be my father and priest, and I’ll pay you ten shekels of silver a year and provide your clothes and your food.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So the Levite agreed to move in with him and the young man became like one of his sons.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Micah ordained the young Levite as his priest, and he lived in his house.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And Micah declared, “Now I know that Yahweh will bless me and prosper me, since a Levite now serves as my priest.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">In those days there was no king in Israel, and the tribe of Dan sought a territory to settle in. They still had no place to call their own among the tribes of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So the Danites sent out from Zorah and from Eshtaol five of their valiant men to spy out the land, telling them, “Go, explore the land.” When they advanced to the hill country of Ephraim, they got as far as Micah’s house and camped near there.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When they approached Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite, so they went over to him and asked, “Why are you here? Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">He replied, “Micah helped me. He hired me, and I’ve become his priest.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then they said to him, “Good! Please pray to God for us and find out if our mission will succeed.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">The priest replied, “You have nothing to worry about. The eyes of Yahweh are watching over your mission. You will succeed.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So the five spies went northward and came to Laish. They observed that the people were wealthy and living in security, after the manner of the Sidonians. Their quiet and carefree community lacked nothing. Furthermore, they lived far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone, leaving them defenseless.</verse>
				<verse number="8">When the spies returned to Zorah and Eshtaol from their expedition, they were asked, “What’s your report?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Come on, let’s do this!” they replied. “Listen, we’ve seen the land, and it’s very good. Don’t just sit here wasting time; let’s go quickly and invade the land to conquer and possess it.</verse>
				<verse number="10">When we arrive, we will encounter an unsuspecting people. The land is wide open and fruitful. God has indeed given it into your hand!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So six hundred Danites, fully armed for war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.</verse>
				<verse number="12">They went up and camped west of Kiriath Jearim in Judah. (To this day that place is called The Camp of Dan.)</verse>
				<verse number="13">From there they passed through the hill country of Ephraim until they arrived at the house of Micah.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then the five men who had explored the region of Laish remarked to their comrades, “Did you know there’s an ephod somewhere in these houses, and other idols and an idol overlaid with silver? So decide what you’ll do about it.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So they stopped there and came to Micah’s house where the young Levite lived, and they greeted him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">While the six hundred fully armed Danites stationed themselves by the entrance of the gate,</verse>
				<verse number="17">the five spies proceeded to enter and take the idol overlaid with silver, the ephod, and the other idols. Now the priest was standing with the six hundred fully armed men at the entrance of the gate.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When he saw the men going into Micah’s house to take the idol overlaid with silver, the ephod, and the other idols, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">They said to him, “Be quiet! Don’t say a word, just come with us and be our priest and a father to us all. Isn’t it better for you to be a priest representing an entire tribe of Israel rather than the house of only one man?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">The offer pleased the priest and he accepted. He took all the idols and the ephod and joined the Danites.</verse>
				<verse number="21">They resumed their journey with their children, their livestock, and their possessions going in front of them.</verse>
				<verse number="22">When they had traveled a considerable distance from Micah’s home, Micah and his neighbors gathered and chased the Danites until they caught up with them.</verse>
				<verse number="23">They shouted at the Danites, who turned around and answered Micah, “What’s your problem? Why have you come against us with such a company?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">He replied, “Why did you take the gods that I made, kidnap my priest, and march off? What’s left for me now? How dare you ask me, ‘What’s my problem?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="25">The Danites retorted, “We don’t want to hear any more of your complaints lest some of our hot-tempered men here attack and kill you, your friends, and your household.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">So the Danites went their way. When Micah realized that he was outnumbered, he turned around and went back home.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The Danites, Micah’s priest, and all that Micah had made, came to Laish, a city of quiet and unsuspecting people. They slaughtered them and burned down their city.</verse>
				<verse number="28">No one came to their rescue, because Laish was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with Aram. Laish was in the valley that belonged to Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and lived in it.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Although the city used to be called Laish, they named the city Dan after their ancestor Dan the Israelite.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The Danites erected their own idol to worship. Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his sons served as priests to the tribe of the Danites until the time the nation went into captivity.</verse>
				<verse number="31">So they enshrined the idol Micah had made, and they made it their own even though the proper house of God stood at Shiloh.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">These were the days when there was no king ruling in Israel. Now there was a Levite who lived in the remote hill country of Ephraim. He took as his mistress a woman from Bethlehem in Judah,</verse>
				<verse number="2">but she eventually was unfaithful. She deserted him and returned to her father’s house in Bethlehem where she stayed for four months.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The Levite set out with his servant and a pair of donkeys to find her, win back her heart, and try to persuade her to return home with him. She received him into her father’s house, and when the girl’s father saw him, he received him warmly.</verse>
				<verse number="4">His father-in-law, the girl’s father, pressed him to stay, so the Levite stayed with him three days, and they ate and drank together.</verse>
				<verse number="5">On the fourth day, early in the morning, he started to leave, but his father-in-law, the girl’s father, insisted, “Eat something first to give you strength for your journey; then you can leave.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">After the two of them sat down and had breakfast together, the girl’s father said to the Levite, “You might as well stay overnight and enjoy yourself.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">The Levite started to leave, but his mistress’ father kept urging him to stay until he turned back and spent another night there.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Early in the morning of the fifth day, he was about to leave when the girl’s father said, “Come, have breakfast.” They ate together and lingered there until past noon.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then the Levite, his mistress, and his attendant started to leave. But his mistress’ father said to him, “Look, the day is almost gone; stay another night here and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow, you can start early on your journey and head for home.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">But the Levite refused; he and his two donkeys, his servant, and his mistress set out and traveled as far as the vicinity of Jebus—that is, Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Late in the day, they were near Jebus, and the servant said to his master, “Let’s go into this town of the Jebusites and spend the night there.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">His master said to him, “ No. They are not of Israel. We will not enter a town of foreigners. We will go on to Gibeah.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Come,” he said to his attendant, “we’ll go to another town and spend the night either in Gibeah or in Ramah.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">So they traveled on, and as the sun set, they were near Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin.</verse>
				<verse number="15">They turned off there and entered Gibeah to spend the night. The Levite, his servant, and his mistress sat down in the town square, but nobody invited them indoors to spend the night.</verse>
				<verse number="16">In the evening, an old man came into town from working in his field. This man was from the hill country of Ephraim and resided at Gibeah, where the townspeople were of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He happened to see the travelers sitting in the town square. The old man inquired, “Where do you come from? And where are you headed?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">The Levite replied, “We’re just passing through. We’re traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the other end of the hill country of Ephraim, where I live. I just made a journey to Bethlehem of Judah, and now we’re on our way to the House of Yahweh, but nobody has offered us hospitality.</verse>
				<verse number="19">We have plenty of straw and feed for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me and the woman and for the attendant with us. All we need is a roof over our heads; we lack nothing.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Rest easy,” said the old man. “I’ll take care of all your needs. You won’t need to spend the night in the square.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">So the old man took them into his house. He prepared fodder for the donkeys; then they washed their feet, and they ate and drank together.</verse>
				<verse number="22">They were enjoying themselves when suddenly some perverted and depraved men of the town surrounded the house and pounded on the door. They called to the aged owner of the house, “Bring out the man you invited into your house so that we can have sex with him.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">The owner of the house went out to reason with them. “Please, my friends,” he said. “Don’t commit such a wicked act. This man is my guest! Do not perpetrate this outrage.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Look, here are the man’s mistress and my virgin daughter—let me bring them out to you. Do what you wish with them. Have your pleasure with them, but don’t do such an outrageous thing to this man.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">But the men refused to listen to him, so the Levite seized his mistress and pushed her out to them. They raped her repeatedly all night until morning and finally let her go when dawn broke.</verse>
				<verse number="26">At sunrise the woman staggered back to the house where her master had spent the night and collapsed at the entrance of the man’s house.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When the Levite arose in the morning, he opened the doors of the house to start on his journey, and he saw his mistress lying at the entrance of the house with her hands on the threshold.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Get up,” he said to her, “it’s time to go.” But there was no response, for she was dead. The man placed her body on the donkey and set out for home.</verse>
				<verse number="29">When he arrived home, he took a sword, cut the corpse of his mistress limb by limb into twelve pieces, and sent them, one for each tribe, throughout Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And everyone who saw this horrible display, cried out, “Never have we seen such brutality take place from the day we came up from the land of Egypt to this day. We need to decide what we should do about this!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">The Israelites were united as one man from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, including those living in Gilead on the other side of the Jordan. Everyone assembled together before Yahweh at Mizpah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">All the leaders of all the people from the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of God’s people, four hundred thousand fighting men armed with swords.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had assembled at Mizpah. The Israelites said to them, “Tell us, how did this evil rape and murder happen?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">The Levite, whose mistress had been murdered, replied, “My mistress and I stopped in Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin to spend the night.</verse>
				<verse number="5">That night, the depraved men of Gibeah came after me to harm me, gathering around the house in the night where I was staying. They intended to kill me, but instead, they raped my mistress, and she died.</verse>
				<verse number="6">This deliberate, outrageous act of depravity was committed in Israel! Therefore, I took her body and cut it in pieces and sent the pieces throughout every part of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now you Israelites must decide on a response! Let’s do something about it here and now!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then all the people stood in unison and declared, “None of us will go back to our cities or return to our homes.</verse>
				<verse number="9">This is what we’re going to do to Gibeah: We’ll cast lots to choose who will fight against it.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And we’ll take a tenth of the men of our tribes of Israel to carry supplies for our forces. When our army arrives at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin, we’ll give them what they deserve for the outrageous, disgraceful act they committed in Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So all the men of Israel united as one man to come against Gibeah.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The Israelite tribes sent couriers throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this brutal crime that you have done?</verse>
				<verse number="13">We demand that you surrender the depraved perverts from Gibeah who took part in this evil act. We’ll put them to death and purge the evil out of Israel.” But the Benjamites refused to yield to the demands of their brothers the Israelites.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Instead, the Benjamites gathered warriors from all their towns to come to Gibeah and fight their brothers, the Israelites.</verse>
				<verse number="15">On that day, the Benjamites gathered a force from their towns of twenty-six thousand armed men, not including the seven hundred elite soldiers of Gibeah.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Among Benjamin’s elite troops, seven hundred were left-handed, and each of them could sling a rock and hit a target within a hairbreadth without missing.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The tribes of Israel had four hundred thousand experienced soldiers armed with swords, not counting Benjamin’s warriors.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Before the battle, the armies of Israel went to the house of God to seek counsel from God. The Israelites inquired, “Which tribe gets to go first to battle the Benjamites?” Yahweh answered, “Judah will go first.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">The Israelites got up the next morning and encamped near Gibeah.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The men of Israel took up battle positions against the Benjamites at Gibeah,</verse>
				<verse number="21">but the Benjamites rushed out of the city, and slaughtered twenty-two thousand Israelites.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The men of Israel encouraged one another and resumed their battle positions where they had lined up the first day.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The Israelites wept before Yahweh until evening, and they inquired of Yahweh, “Should we go out again to battle with our brothers the Benjamites?” And Yahweh answered, “Yes, go back into the battle!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">The next day, the Israelites advanced toward the Benjamites.</verse>
				<verse number="25">When Benjamin marched out from Gibeah to engage them, they struck down another eighteen thousand Israelite swordsmen.</verse>
				<verse number="26">After losing again, the entire Israelite army went up to the house of God, and they sat there fasting and weeping before Yahweh all day until evening and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The Israelites inquired of Yahweh at Shiloh, for the ark of God’s covenant was there in those days.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Phineas son of Eleazer, son of Aaron, ministered there before the ark. He inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Should we resume our battle with our brothers, the Benjamites? Or should we quit?” Yahweh answered, “Attack! For tomorrow I will give you the victory!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">So Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah.</verse>
				<verse number="30">On the third day, one company of Israelites advanced against the Benjamites, deploying against Gibeah as they had before.</verse>
				<verse number="31">This tactic drew the Benjamites out of the city to attack the advancing Israelite army, leaving the city unguarded. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before. There they killed about thirty men of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="32">The Benjamites boasted, “We are defeating them just as we did before!” But when the Benjamites had taken the bait, the Israelites said, “Retreat, and draw them away from the city to the main roads.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Every Israelite rose from his position and took their assumed positions at Baal-Tamar. Then the Israelites who were hiding in ambush jumped up from their positions west of Gibeah.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Ten thousand elite soldiers from all over Israel made their direct assault on Gibeah. The fighting was fierce. And the Benjamites had no clue that disaster was at their doorstep.</verse>
				<verse number="35">On that day, Yahweh struck down the Benjamites before Israel. The Israelites slaughtered 25,100 swordsmen of Benjamin.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then the Benjamites realized that they were defeated. The Israelites had moved back because they were depending on the surprise attack they had set up near Gibeah.</verse>
				<verse number="37">The men of Israel who had been waiting in ambush made a mad dash for Gibeah, attacked the city, and killed its inhabitants.</verse>
				<verse number="38">The Israelites’ strategy was to send up a smoke signal from the city once they had sacked it,</verse>
				<verse number="39">and when the men of Israel saw the smoke signal, they would turn and rejoin the battle. When the Benjamites had inflicted about thirty casualties on the men of Israel, they said, “Look, we are defeating them as we did in the first battle!”</verse>
				<verse number="40">But when the smoke signal began to go up from the city, the Benjamites looked behind them and saw the whole city going up in smoke!</verse>
				<verse number="41">When the men of Israel turned back, the men of Benjamin saw that disaster had come upon them, and they panicked.</verse>
				<verse number="42">So they fled toward the wilderness, retreating from the Israelites, but the Israelites overtook them and killed them there.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Surrounding the Benjamites, the Israelites chased them and easily overran them in the area east of Gibeah.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Eighteen thousand Benjamites died, all of them valiant fighters.</verse>
				<verse number="45">As they turned and fled in the wilderness to Rimmon Rock, the Israelites picked off another five thousand Benjamites on the main roads. They chased them as far as Gidom, killing two thousand more there.</verse>
				<verse number="46">That day, a total of twenty-five thousand sword-bearing Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters.</verse>
				<verse number="47">But six hundred men who had fled to the wilderness camped at Rimmon Rock and remained there for four months.</verse>
				<verse number="48">The men of Israel went back to the Benjamites and slaughtered every living thing in every town—men and beasts and all that were found, and they burned down every town they came across.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">The men of Israel had bound themselves by an oath at Mizpah: “Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">And then the people came to Bethel and sat until evening before God, and they raised their voice with groaning and great weeping.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They said, “ Yahweh, the true God of Israel, we have lost one of our own tribes today. Why has this happened to Israel?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">When the next day dawned, the people got up early, built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the Israelites asked one another, “Which tribe of Israel failed to appear in our assembly before Yahweh?” Under the terms of their solemn oath, whoever did not come before Yahweh at Mizpah should be put to death.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Even so, the Israelites had compassion for their brothers of the tribe of Benjamin and were grieved deeply over their loss. They lamented, “One of our tribes has been eliminated from Israel this day.</verse>
				<verse number="7">How can we provide wives for the few survivors since we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give any of our daughters as wives for them?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then they inquired, “Were there any from the tribes of Israel who did not come up before Yahweh at Mizpah?” They found out that no one from Jabesh-Gilead had come to the assembly.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When the roll was called among the people, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead was there.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So the people sent twelve thousand soldiers with the command: “Go to the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead and kill them with the sword, including the women and children.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This is what you are to do: exterminate every man and every woman who is not a virgin.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">And they found four hundred unmarried young virgins among those living in Jabesh-Gilead. They seized them and brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then the whole congregation sent word to the Benjamites at Rimmon Rock and offered them peace.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The Benjamites returned, and the Israelites presented the young women they had spared at Jabesh-Gilead. But they were not a sufficient number of wives for them all.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The people were remorseful and had compassion on the tribe of Benjamin because Yahweh had taken out a tribe of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The elders of the tribes said, “Where are we to find wives for the survivors of Benjamin since there are no more women left in their tribe?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">And they said, “There must be heirs for the survivors of Benjamin to prevent the tribe from being wiped out from Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Yet we cannot give them any of our daughters as wives.” For the Israelites had sworn, “A curse will rest on anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So they said, “Look, Yahweh ’s yearly festival is taking place at Shiloh, just north of Bethel, and east of the main road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and a little south of Lebonah.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">And they instructed the Benjamites, “Go and hide in the vineyards.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Watch for the young women of Shiloh to come out for their dances. When they come out of the vineyards, grab one of the young women of Shiloh to be your wife. Then go and live in your tribal land of Benjamin.</verse>
				<verse number="22">If their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we’ll tell them, ‘Do us this favor, please. Grant us permission for the Benjamites to keep them as wives because in battle we didn’t seize them from you. And since you didn’t give them to us, you’re not guilty of breaking your oath.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So the Benjamites took as many wives as there were men from among the dancers, and they carried them away. Then they returned to their own territory and rebuilt towns to live in.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The Israelites dispersed by tribes and families, and they went out from there to their own territories.</verse>
				<verse number="25">In those days, Israel had no king, and everyone did whatever they wanted to do.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">During the era when champion-deliverers ruled in Israel, a severe famine overtook the land. Elimelech, a man of importance, left Bethlehem and immigrated to the country of Moab. He took with him his wife Naomi and their two sons, Mahlon and Chilion. They belonged to the clan of Ephrath from Bethlehem in Judah. While residing in Moab,</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">Elimelech died and left his widow Naomi alone with her two sons.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The two sons both married Moabite women, Orpah and Ruth. About ten years later,</verse>
				<verse number="5">Mahlon and Chilion also died and left Naomi all alone without husband or sons.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Sometime later, Naomi heard that Yahweh had visited his people and blessed them with an abundant harvest; so she decided to leave Moab with her daughters-in-law.</verse>
				<verse number="7">With Orpah and Ruth at her side, Naomi began her journey to return to the land of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But soon Naomi said to them, “Each of you, go back to your mother’s home. May Yahweh show his loyal love and kindness to you—the same loyal love and kindness you’ve shown to me and to those who have died.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And may Yahweh give you another husband and cause you to find rest in a happy home.” Then Naomi tenderly embraced Orpah and Ruth and kissed them goodbye, but they wailed and sobbed.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Through their tears, they said to her, “No! We want to be with you and go with you to your people.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">“My daughters, you must go back,” Naomi answered. “Why do you want to come with me? Do you think I could have sons again to give you new husbands?</verse>
				<verse number="12">Turn around my daughters and go back home, for I’m too old to marry again. Even if I thought there was still hope for me, and married today and gave birth to sons,</verse>
				<verse number="13">would you wait until they had grown up? Should you live for so many years without husbands? No, my daughters, you must not return with me. My life is too bitter for you to share it with me because Yahweh has brought calamity to my life!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">When they heard Naomi’s words, Orpah and Ruth wailed and sobbed again. Then Orpah embraced and kissed her mother-in-law goodbye and went back home, but Ruth clung tightly to Naomi and refused to let go of her.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Naomi said, “Ruth, listen. Your sister-in-law is going back to Moab to her people and to her gods. Now go with her.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But tearfully, Ruth insisted, “Please don’t ask me again to leave you! I want to go with you and stay with you. Wherever you go, I will go; wherever you live, I will live. Your people will now be my people, and your God will now be my God.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Wherever you die, I will die there, too; that’s where your people will bury me— next to you. Nothing but death itself will separate me from you, so help me God!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">When Naomi realized that Ruth’s heart was set on going with her, she said nothing more.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Naomi and Ruth traveled together from Moab until they came to Bethlehem. The entire town was buzzing when they heard they had arrived! Astounded, the women of the town said to one another, “Is this really Naomi, who left us so long ago?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Please don’t call me Naomi anymore,” she insisted. “Instead, call me Marah, because Almighty God has dealt me a bitter blow.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When I left here, my heart was full and content with my family, but Yahweh has brought me back empty and destitute. Why call me by my name, ‘Pleasant,’ when Yahweh has opposed me, and Almighty God has brought me so much trouble?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">So Naomi returned to her village with Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law. They arrived in Bethlehem just as the barley harvest had begun.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Naomi’s deceased husband, Elimelech, had a very wealthy relative, an honorable and prominent man in Bethlehem named Boaz.</verse>
				<verse number="2">One day Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain. Maybe someone will be kind enough to let me gather the grain he leaves behind.” Naomi said to her, “Go, my daughter.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So Ruth went to the fields to gather the grain the reapers left behind. It just so happened that she found herself working at the edges of a field belonging to Boaz of the family of Elimelech.</verse>
				<verse number="4">At that moment, Boaz came from Bethlehem to survey his harvest. He greeted the harvesters, “May Yahweh be with you.” They replied, “May Yahweh bless you.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Noticing Ruth, Boaz asked his foreman in charge of the harvesters, “Who is that young woman over there?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">The foreman answered, “She’s a Moabite girl who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab.</verse>
				<verse number="7">She asked for permission to gather the grain left behind by the reapers. Except for one short break, she’s been on her feet working in the field since early this morning.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Boaz walked over to Ruth and said, “Listen, my daughter, don’t leave this field to glean somewhere else. Stay here in my field and follow the young women who work for me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Watch my harvesters to see into which fields they go to cut grain, and follow them. When you’re thirsty, go and drink from the water jugs that the young men have filled. I’ve warned the young men not to bother you.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Astounded, Ruth bowed low with her face to the ground, and said to him, “I’m a foreigner. Why have you been so kind and taken notice of me?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Boaz answered, “I’ve heard all about what you’ve done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband. I know your story—how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people and a culture that must seem strange to you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">May Yahweh reward you for your sacrifices, and because of what you’ve done, may you have a full and rich reward from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to find shelter!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Ruth replied, “May I continue to find favor in your sight, kind sir. You have spoken to my heart kind and reassuring words that comfort me, even though I am not as worthy as one of your servant girls.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">At mealtime, Boaz said to her, “Come here and eat with us. Here is bread, and wine to dip it in.” Ruth immediately sat down with the workers. Boaz handed her some roasted grain, and she ate all she wanted until she was satisfied—she even had some left over.</verse>
				<verse number="15">After she had returned to gather grain, Boaz instructed his young men, “Let her glean even among the standing sheaves, and don’t disgrace her.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Pull out from the bundles some handfuls of grain and drop them on purpose for her to gather, and don’t bother her.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">So Ruth gathered grain in Boaz’s field until evening. When she threshed out what she had gathered, it came to more than half a bushel of barley.</verse>
				<verse number="18">She carried it back to town and showed her mother-in-law how much she had gleaned. Then Ruth also took out the roasted grain she had saved from mealtime and shared it with Naomi.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Her mother-in-law asked Ruth, “Where did you gather all this from? In whose field did you work? May Yahweh bless the man who showed you special attention.” She told her mother-in-law about all that happened that day, and said, “The man in whose field I gathered grain today is Boaz.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Naomi said to Ruth, “ Yahweh ’s loving-kindness has not left us either through life or through death! Boaz is closely related to us. He is a kinsman-redeemer of our family. May Yahweh greatly bless Boaz!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Ruth the Moabite responded, “He even said to me, ‘Stay close by my servants until they have finished all my harvest.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Naomi replied, “It is best, my daughter, that you stay near his young women, otherwise you’ll be alone and might be bothered in someone else’s field.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So Ruth worked alongside the young women who served Boaz. She lived with her mother-in-law and gleaned in Boaz’s fields until the end of the barley and wheat harvests.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">One day, Naomi said to Ruth: “I want to see you marry so that you’ll be happy and secure.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now listen, a man named Boaz is our relative. You worked with his servant girls in his fields. This evening, he’ll be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now, take a bath and put on some nice perfume. Dress in your best clothes and go to the threshing floor, but don’t let him know you’re there until he’s had plenty to eat and drink.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Watch closely to see where he lies down. Then go, uncover his feet, and lie down there. He will tell you what to do.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Ruth answered, “I’ll do everything you’ve told me.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">That evening, Ruth went down to the threshing floor and did all her mother-in-law had told her to do.</verse>
				<verse number="7">After his evening meal, Boaz was in a good mood. He went to lie down at the far end of the grain pile and fell fast asleep. Ruth quietly tiptoed over to him, uncovered his feet, and lay down.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Around midnight, Boaz was startled, and he awoke. He was surprised to find a woman lying at his feet.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Who are you?” Boaz asked. “I am Ruth, your servant girl,” she answered. “Spread the corner of your garment over me because you are a close relative by marriage, one who is my kinsman-redeemer.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Boaz said: “Dear woman, may Yahweh bless you, for this act of kindness you are showing me exceeds the kindness you have shown to Naomi. You didn’t search for a young man to marry, either rich or poor.</verse>
				<verse number="11">My daughter, don’t worry. I promise to do everything you ask, because everyone knows you’re a brave woman of noble character.</verse>
				<verse number="12">It’s true that I am a kinsman-redeemer, but you have a closer kinsman-redeemer than I.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Stay here tonight, and I will protect you. In the morning, we’ll see if he’s willing to redeem you. If he does, good; let him. But if he refuses to redeem you, then I promise, as surely as Yahweh lives, I will. Sleep here until morning.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">So Ruth stayed near Boaz’s feet that night. She awoke before it was light enough for anyone to recognize her. Boaz thought, “No one must know that a woman visited me at the threshing floor.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">As Ruth was about to leave, Boaz said to her, “Here, bring me the cloak you’re wearing and hold it open.” As she held it open, Boaz poured six measures of barley into it. He then helped place it on her head to carry, and she went back to Bethlehem.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked her, “How did it go, my dear daughter? How did Boaz receive you? ” Ruth told Naomi everything that he did for her.</verse>
				<verse number="17">She added, “Boaz gave me all this barley, saying, ‘You must not go home empty-handed without a gift for your mother-in-law.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Naomi answered, “My daughter, wait here until you see what happens. Boaz will not rest until he has finished doing what he promised he would do today.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">No sooner had Boaz gone up to the city gate and sat down when the kinsman-redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken came passing by. Boaz called to him, “Come over here, friend; sit down with me. We have some business to attend to.” So the man went over and sat down.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then Boaz invited ten men of the city council and said, “ Please, sit down here with us.” After they were seated,</verse>
				<verse number="3">Boaz turned to the kinsman-redeemer and said, “ Sir, Naomi has returned from the country of Moab, and she’s selling the piece of property that belonged to our relative Elimelech.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So I thought you ought to know about it. Buy it if you want. We can make it official in the presence of those here and in the presence of the elders of our people. As the kinsman-redeemer, you have the first right of refusal. Redeem it if you choose to, but if not, tell me so I will know, as I am next in line.” The man replied, “I’ll redeem it.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Boaz added, “The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead. Therefore, it will be your responsibility to father a child in order to maintain the dead man’s name on his inheritance.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">At this, the kinsman-redeemer balked and said, “In that case, I’m not able to redeem it for myself without risking my own inheritance. Take my purchase option of redemption yourself, for I can’t do it.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">(At that time in Israel, in order to finalize a transaction concerning redeeming and transferring property, a man would customarily remove a sandal and give it to the other party, making the contract legally binding.)</verse>
				<verse number="8">So when the kinsman-redeemer said to Boaz, “Take my purchase option of redemption for yourself,” he took off his sandal and gave it to Boaz.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Boaz turned to the elders and announced publicly, “Today, you are witnesses that I have purchased from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon’s widow, to be my wife. I will raise children with her who will maintain the dead man’s name on his inheritance so that the name of the dead may not be cut off from his village and from his family line. Today, you are witnesses of this transaction.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then all the elders and all the people who were at the gate said: “We are witnesses. May Yahweh make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built up the house of Israel. May you become famous in Bethlehem! May you become very prosperous!</verse>
				<verse number="12">And may Yahweh give you children by this young woman, and through them, may your family be like the family of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So Boaz and Ruth married, and they became one as husband and wife. Yahweh opened Ruth’s womb, and she bore a son.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then the women of Bethlehem blessed Naomi: “Praise Yahweh, who never abandoned you nor withheld from you a kinsman-redeemer! And may his name be famous in Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="15">May this child renew your life and sustain you in your old age! May your daughter-in-law, who loves you dearly, be more to you than seven sons could ever be, for she has given you a wonderful grandchild!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then Naomi took her grandson and cuddled him in her arms and cared for him as if he were her own.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “At last, Naomi has a son!” They named him Obed, and he became the father of Jesse, the father of David.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron,</verse>
				<verse number="19">Hezron the father of Ram, Ram the father of Amminadab,</verse>
				<verse number="20">Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,</verse>
				<verse number="21">Salmon the father of Boaz, Boaz the father of Obed,</verse>
				<verse number="22">Obed the father of Jesse, who had a famous son, King David.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">What delight comes to the one who follows God’s ways! He won’t walk in step with the wicked, nor share the sinner’s way, nor be found sitting in the scorner’s seat.</verse>
				<verse number="2">His passion is to remain true to the Word of “I AM,” meditating day and night on the true revelation of light.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He will be standing firm like a flourishing tree planted by God’s design, deeply rooted by the brooks of bliss, bearing fruit in every season of life. He is never dry, never fainting, ever blessed, ever prosperous.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But how different are the wicked. They are like chaff blown away by the wind.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The wicked will not endure the day of judgment, for God will not defend them. Nothing they do will succeed or endure for long, for they have no part with those who walk in truth.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But how different it is for the righteous! The Lord embraces their paths as they move forward while the way of the wicked leads only to doom.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">How dare the nations plan a rebellion. Their foolish plots are futile!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Look at how the power brokers of the world rise up to hold their summit as the rulers scheme and confer together against Yahweh and his Anointed King, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Let’s come together and break away from the Creator. Once and for all let’s cast off these controlling chains of God and his Christ!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">God-Enthroned merely laughs at them; the Sovereign One mocks their madness!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then with the fierceness of his fiery anger, he settles the issue and terrifies them to death with these words:</verse>
				<verse number="6">“I myself have poured out my King on Zion, my holy mountain.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">“I will reveal the eternal purpose of God. For he has decreed over me, ‘You are my favored Son. And as your Father I have crowned you as my King Eternal. Today I became your Father.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Ask me to give you the nations and I will do it, and they shall become your legacy. Your domain will stretch to the ends of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And you will shepherd them with unlimited authority, crushing their rebellion as an iron rod smashes jars of clay!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Listen to me, all you rebel kings and all you upstart judges of the earth. Learn your lesson while there’s still time.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Serve and worship the awe-inspiring God. Recognize his greatness and bow before him, trembling with reverence in his presence.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Fall facedown before him and kiss the Son before his anger is roused against you. Remember that his wrath can be quickly kindled! But many blessings are waiting for all who turn aside to hide themselves in him!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Lord, I have so many enemies, so many who are against me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Listen to how they whisper their slander against me, saying: “Look! He’s hopeless! Even God can’t save him from this!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">But in the depths of my heart I truly know that you, Yahweh, have become my Shield; You take me and surround me with yourself. Your glory covers me continually. You lift high my head.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I have cried out to you, Yahweh, from your holy presence. You send me a Father’s help.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So now I’ll lie down and sleep like a baby— then I’ll awake in safety, for you surround me with your glory.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Even though ten thousand dark powers prowl around me, I won’t be afraid.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Rise up and help me, Yahweh! Come and save me, God! For you will slap them in the face, breaking the power of their words to harm me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For the Lord alone is my Savior. What a feast of favor and bliss he gives his people!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">God, you are my righteousness, my Champion Defender. Answer me when I cry for help! Whenever I was in distress, you enlarged me. I’m being squeezed again—I need your kindness right away! Grant me your grace, hear my prayer, and set me free!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Listen to me, you elite among men: How long will you defame my honor and drag it down into shame? Will you ever stop insulting me? How long will you set your heart on shadows, chasing your lies and delusions?</verse>
				<verse number="3">May we never forget that Yahweh works wonders for every one of his devoted lovers. And this is how I know that he will answer my every prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Tremble in awe before the Lord, and do not sin against him. Be still upon your bed and search your heart before him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Bring to Yahweh the sacrifice of righteousness and put your trust in him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Lord, prove them wrong when they say, “God can’t help you!” Let the light of your radiant face break through and shine upon us!</verse>
				<verse number="7">The intense pleasure you give me surpasses the gladness of harvest time, even more than when the harvesters gaze upon their ripened grain and when their new wine overflows.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now, because of you, Lord, I will lie down in peace and sleep comes at once, for no matter what happens, I will live unafraid!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Listen, Yahweh, to my passionate prayer! Can’t you hear my groaning?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Don’t you hear how I’m crying out to you? My King and my God, consider my every word, for I am calling out to you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">At each and every sunrise you will hear my voice as I prepare my sacrifice of prayer to you. Every morning I lay out the pieces of my life on the altar and wait for your fire to fall upon my heart.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I know that you, God, are never pleased with lawlessness, and evil ones will never be invited into your house.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Boasters collapse, unable to survive your scrutiny, for your hatred of evildoers is clear.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You will make an end of all those who lie. How you hate their hypocrisy and despise all who love violence!</verse>
				<verse number="7">But I know that you will welcome me into your house, for I am covered by your covenant of mercy and love. So I come to your sanctuary with deepest awe to bow in worship and adore you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh, lead me in the pathways of your pleasure just like you promised me you would, or else my enemies will conquer me. Smooth out your road in front of me, straight and level, so that I will know where to walk.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Their words are unreliable. Destruction is in their hearts, drawing people into their darkness with their speeches. They are smooth-tongued deceivers, flattering with their words.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Declare them guilty, O God! Let their own schemes be their downfall! Let the guilt of their sins collapse on top of them, for they rebel against you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But let them all be glad, those who turn aside to hide themselves in you. May they keep shouting for joy forever! Overshadow them in your presence as they sing and rejoice. Then every lover of your name will burst forth with endless joy.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Lord, how wonderfully you bless the righteous. Your favor wraps around each one and covers them under your canopy of kindness and joy.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh, don’t condemn me. Don’t punish me in your fiery anger.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Please deal gently with me, Yahweh; show me mercy, for I’m sick and frail and weak. Heal me, Yahweh, for I’m falling apart.</verse>
				<verse number="3">My soul is so troubled; but you, Yahweh —how long?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yahweh, turn to me and rescue my life because I know your faithful love will never fail me.</verse>
				<verse number="5">In the darkness of death who remembers your name in worship? How could I bring you praise if I’m buried in a tomb?</verse>
				<verse number="6">I’m worn out with my weeping and groaning. Night after night I soak my pillow with tears, and flood my bed with weeping.</verse>
				<verse number="7">My eyes of faith won’t focus anymore, for sorrow fills my heart. There are so many enemies who come against me!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Turn from me, all you troublemakers! For Yahweh has turned to hear the sound of my weeping.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yes! Yahweh my healer has heard all my pleading and has taken hold of my prayers and answered them all.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now it’s my enemies who have been shamed. Terror-stricken, they will turn back again, knowing the bitterness of sudden disgrace!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh, my God, I turn to hide my soul in you. Save me from all those who pursue and persecute me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">There is none to deliver me but you! Don’t let my foes fall upon me like fierce lions with teeth bared. Can’t you see how they want to rip my soul to shreds?</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh, my God, if I have done evil like they say I have, and my hands are guilty,</verse>
				<verse number="4">if I have wronged someone at peace with me, if I have betrayed a friend, repaying evil for good, or if I have unjustly harmed my enemy,</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then let my enemy pursue and overtake me. Let them grind me into the ground. Let them take my life from me and drag my dignity through the dust!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Yahweh, arise in your anger against the anger of my enemies. Awaken your fury and stand up for me! Execute the judgment you have decreed against them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">All the people gather around you. Return to your place on high to preside over them.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You are Yahweh who judges the people. Vindicate me publicly, Yahweh, and restore my honor and integrity. Declare me innocent.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Once and for all, bring to an end the evil tactics of the wicked! Establish the cause of the righteous, for you are the righteous God, the soul searcher, who tests every heart to examine the thoughts and motives.</verse>
				<verse number="10">God, your wraparound presence is my shield. You bring victory to all who are pure in heart.</verse>
				<verse number="11">God, your righteousness is revealed when you judge. Because of the strength of your forgiveness, your anger does not break out every day.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yet if one does not repent, you will not relent to sharpen your shining sword. You have an arsenal of lethal weapons that you’ve prepared for them. You have bent and strung your bow, making your judgment-arrows shafts of burning fire.</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">Look how the wicked conceive their evil schemes. They go into labor with their lies and give birth to trouble.</verse>
				<verse number="15">They dig a pit for others to fall into, not knowing that they will be the very ones who will fall into it.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Every pit-digger who works to trap and harm others will be trapped by his own treachery.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But I will give my thanks to you, Yahweh, for you make everything right in the end. I will sing my highest praise to the God of the Highest Place!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh, our Sovereign God, your glory streams from the heavens above, filling the earth with the majesty of your name! People everywhere see your splendor.</verse>
				<verse number="2">You have built a stronghold by the songs of children. Strength rises up with the chorus of infants. This kind of praise has power to shut Satan’s mouth. Childlike worship will silence the madness of those who oppose you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Look at the splendor of your skies, your creative genius glowing in the heavens. When I gaze at your moon and your stars, mounted like jewels in their settings, I know you are the fascinating artist who fashioned it all! But I have to ask this question:</verse>
				<verse number="4">Why would you bother with puny, mortal man or care about human beings?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yet what honor you have given to men, created only a little lower than Elohim, crowned with glory and magnificence.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You have delegated to them rulership over all you have made, with everything under their authority, placing earth itself under the feet of your image-bearers.</verse>
				<verse number="7">All the created order and every living thing of the earth, sky, and sea— the wildest beasts and all that move in the paths of the sea — everything is in submission to Adam’s sons.</verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh, our Sovereign God, your glory streams from the heavens above, filling the earth with the majesty of your name! People everywhere see your splendor!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">I will worship you, Yahweh, with extended hands as my whole heart erupts with praise! I will tell everyone everywhere about your wonderful works!</verse>
				<verse number="2">I will be glad and shout in triumph. I will sing praise to your exalted name, O Most High.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For when you appear, I worship you while my enemies run in retreat. They stumble and perish before your presence.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For you have stood up for my cause and vindicated me when I needed you the most. From your righteous throne you have given me justice.</verse>
				<verse number="5">With a blast of your rebuke, nations are destroyed. You obliterated their names forever and ever.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The Lord thundered and our enemies have been cut off, vanished in everlasting ruins. All their cities have been destroyed— even the memory of them has been erased.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But Yahweh, our mighty God, reigns forever! He sits enthroned as King ready to render his verdicts and judge all with righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He will issue his decrees of judgment, deciding what is right for the entire world, dispensing justice to all.</verse>
				<verse number="9">All who are oppressed may come to Yahweh as a high shelter in the time of trouble, a perfect hiding place.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For everyone who knows your wonderful name keeps putting their trust in you. They can count on you for help no matter what. O Lord, you will never, no never, neglect those who come to you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Listen, everyone! Sing out your praises to the God who rules in Zion! Tell the world about all the miracles he has done!</verse>
				<verse number="12">He tracks down killers and avenges bloodshed, but he will never forget the ones forgotten by others, hearing every one of their cries for justice.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So now, O Lord, don’t forget me. Have mercy on me. Take note of how I’ve been humiliated at the hands of those who hate me. You are the one who can snatch me away from the gates of death.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then I will sing your praises as I pass through the gates of the Daughter of Zion, rejoicing in your deliverance!</verse>
				<verse number="15">For the nations get trapped in the very snares they set for others. The hidden trap they set for the weak has snapped shut upon themselves!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yahweh is famous for his justice. While the wicked are digging a pit for others, they are actually setting the terms for their own judgment. They will fall into their own pit.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Don’t forget this: all the wicked will one day fall into the darkness of death’s domain, including the nations that forget God and reject his ways.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He will not forget the needs of the poor. One day the needy will be remembered, and their hopes will not be forever dashed in disappointment.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yahweh, it’s time to arise and judge the nations who defy you. Don’t let rebellious men triumph.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Make them tremble in fear before your presence. Place a lawgiver over them. Make them know that they are only puny, frail humans who must give account to you!</verse>

				<verse number="1">Lord, why do you seem so far away when evil is near? Why have you hidden yourself when I need you the most?</verse>
				<verse number="2">The arrogant in their elitist pride persecute the poor and helpless. May you pour out upon them the very evil they’ve dreamed up against others!</verse>
				<verse number="3">How they brag and boast of their cravings, exalting the greedy. They congratulate themselves as they despise you—</verse>
				<verse number="4">these arrogant ones, so smug and secure! In their delusion the wicked boast, saying, “God doesn’t care about what we do. There’s nothing to worry about!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So successful are they in their schemes and prosperous in all their plans! Your laws are far from them; they scoff at their enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They boast that neither God nor men will bring them down. They sneer at all their enemies, saying in their hearts, “We’ll have success in all we do and never have to face trouble.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Their mouths spew out cursing, lies, and threats. Only trouble and turmoil come from all their plans.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Like beasts lurking in the shadows of the city, they crouch silently in ambush, waiting for the innocent to pass by. Pouncing on the poor, they catch them in their snare to murder their prey in secret as they plunder their helpless victims.</verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10">They crush the lowly as they fall beneath their brutal blows, watching their victims collapse in defeat!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then they say to themselves, “The Lofty One is not watching while we do this. He doesn’t even care! We can get away with it!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now arise, Yahweh -God! Crush them once and for all! Don’t forget the helpless and oppressed.</verse>
				<verse number="13">How dare the wicked think they’ll reject God and escape judgment. They say to themselves, “God won’t hold me accountable.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Lord, I know you see all that they’re doing, noting their each and every deed. You know the trouble and turmoil they’ve caused. Now punish them thoroughly for all that they’ve done! The poor and helpless ones trust in you, Lord, for you are famous for being the helper of the fatherless. I know you won’t let them down.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Break the power of the wicked and all their strong-arm tactics. Search them out and destroy them for the evil things they’ve done.</verse>
				<verse number="16">You, Yahweh, are King forever and ever! All the nations will perish from your land.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yahweh, you have heard the desires of the humble and seen their hopes. You will hear their cries and encourage their hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The orphans and the oppressed will be terrified no longer, for you will bring them justice, and no earth-dweller will trouble them again.</verse>

			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">My faith shelters my soul continually in Yahweh. Why would you say to me: “ Run away while you can! Fly away like a bird to hide in the mountains for safety.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For your enemies have prepared a trap for you! Can’t you see them hiding in their place of darkness and shadows? They’re set against all those who live upright lives.</verse>
				<verse number="3">What can the righteous accomplish when truth’s pillars are destroyed and law and order collapse?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yet Yahweh is never shaken — he is still found in his temple of holiness, reigning as King Yahweh over all. He closely watches and examines everything man does. With a glance, his eyes examine every heart, for his heavenly rule will prevail over all.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yahweh tests both the righteous and the wicked. God’s very soul detests lovers of violence.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He will rain down upon them judgment for their sins. A scorching wind will be their lot in life.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But remember this: Yahweh is the Righteous One who loves justice, and every godly one will gaze upon his face!</verse>

				<verse number="1">Help, Lord! Save us! For godly ones are disappearing. Where are the dependable, principled ones? They’re a vanishing breed!</verse>

				<verse number="3">You will destroy every proud liar who says, “We lie all we want. Our words are our weapons, and we won’t be held accountable. Who can stop us?” May Yahweh cut off their twisted tongues and seal their lying lips. May they all be silenced—those who boast and brag with their high-minded talk.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">But the Lord says, “Now I will arise! I will defend the poor, those who were plundered, the oppressed, and the needy who groan for help. I will spring into action to rescue and protect them!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">For every word Yahweh speaks is sure and reliable. His truth is tested, found to be flawless, and ever faithful. It’s as pure as silver refined seven times in a crucible of clay.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Lord, you will keep us safe, out of the reach of the wicked. Even though they strut and prowl, tolerating and celebrating what is worthless and vile, you will still lift up those who are yours!</verse>

				<verse number="3">Take a good look at me, Yahweh, my God, and answer me! Breathe your life into my spirit. Bring light to my eyes in this pitch-black darkness or I will sleep the sleep of death.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Don’t let my enemy proclaim, “I’ve prevailed over him.” For all my adversaries will celebrate when I fall.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I have always trusted in your kindness, so answer me. I will spin in a circle of joy when your salvation lifts me up.</verse>

			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">Only the withering soul would say to himself, “There is no God.” Anyone who thinks like this is corrupt and callous, devoid of what is good.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh looks down in love, looking over all of Adam’s sons and daughters. He’s looking to see if there is anyone who acts wisely, any who are searching for God and wanting to please him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But everyone has wandered astray, walking stubbornly toward evil. Not one is good; he can’t even find one.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They live in luxury while exploiting my people! Won’t these workers of wickedness ever learn? They don’t ever think of praying to God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But look at them now, in panic, trembling with terror. For God is on the side of his godly lovers.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Yahweh is always the safest place for the poor when the workers of wickedness oppress them.</verse>

				<verse number="3">They refuse to slander or insult others; they’ll never listen to gossip or rumors, nor would they ever harm a friend with their words.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They will despise evil and evil workers while commending the faithful ones who follow after the truth. They make firm commitments and follow through, even at great cost.</verse>

			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">I love you, Yahweh, and I’m bonded to you, my strength!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh, you’re the bedrock beneath my feet, my faith-fortress, my wonderful deliverer, my God, my rock of rescue where none can reach me. You’re the shield around me, the mighty power that saves me, and my high place.</verse>
				<verse number="3">All I need to do is to call on you, Yahweh, the praiseworthy God. When I do, I’m safe and sound in you— delivered from my foes!</verse>
				<verse number="4">For when the cords of death wrapped around me and torrents of destruction overwhelmed me, taking me to death’s door,</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6">in my distress I cried out to you, the delivering God, and from your temple-throne you heard my troubled cry, and my sobs went right into your heart.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The earth itself shivered and shook. It reeled and rocked before him. As the mountains trembled, they melted away, for his anger was kindled on my behalf!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Fierce flames leapt from his mouth, erupting with blazing, burning coals as smoke and fire encircled him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He stretched heaven’s curtain open and came to my defense. Swiftly he rode to earth as the stormy sky was lowered. He rode a chariot of thunderclouds amidst thick darkness; his steed was a cherub, soaring on outstretched wings of Spirit-Wind.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">Wrapped in the thick-cloud darkness, his thunder-tabernacle surrounded him. He hid himself in mystery-darkness; the dense rain clouds were his garments.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Suddenly the brilliance of his presence broke through with lightning bolts and hail— a tempest dropping coals of fire.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The Lord thundered; the great God above every god spoke with his thunder-voice from the sky. The Most High uttered his voice!</verse>
				<verse number="14">He released his lightning-arrows, and routed my foes. See how they ran and scattered in fear!</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then with his mighty roar he laid bare the foundations of the earth, uncovering the secret source of the sea. The hidden depths of land and sea were exposed by the blast of his hot breath.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He rescued me from the mighty waters and drew me to himself!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Even though I was helpless in the hands of my hateful, strong enemy, you were good to deliver me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When I was at my weakest, my enemies attacked— but the Lord held on to me.</verse>
				<verse number="19">His love broke open the way, and he brought me into a beautiful, broad place. He rescued me—because his delight is in me!</verse>
				<verse number="20">He rewarded me for doing what’s right and staying pure.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I will follow his commands and I’ll not sin by ceasing to follow him, no matter what.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For I’ve kept my eyes focused on his righteous words, and I’ve obeyed everything that he’s told me to do.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I’ve been blameless before him and followed all his ways, keeping my heart pure.</verse>
				<verse number="24">And so Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, because I kept my heart clean before his eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Good people will taste your goodness. And to those who are loyal to you, you love to prove that you are loyal and true.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And for those who are purified, they find you always pure. But you’ll outwit the crooked and cunning with your craftiness.</verse>
				<verse number="27">To the humble you bring heaven’s deliverance, but the proud and haughty you disregard.</verse>
				<verse number="28">God, all at once you turned on a floodlight for me! You are the revelation-light in my darkness, and in your brightness I can see the path ahead.</verse>
				<verse number="29">With you as my strength I can crush an enemy horde, advancing through every stronghold that stands in front of me.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Yahweh, what a perfect God you are! All Yahweh ’s promises have proven true. What a secure shelter for all those who turn to hide themselves in you, the wraparound God.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Could there be any other god like Yahweh? For there is not a more secure foundation than you.</verse>
				<verse number="32">God, you have wrapped me in power and made my way perfect.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Through you I ascend to the highest peaks to stand strong and secure in you.</verse>
				<verse number="34">You’ve trained me with the weapons of warfare-worship; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</verse>
				<verse number="35">You empower me for victory with your wraparound presence. Your power within makes me strong to subdue. By stooping down in gentleness, you made me great!</verse>
				<verse number="36">You’ve set me free, and now I’m standing complete, ready to fight some more!</verse>
				<verse number="37">I caught up with my enemies and conquered them and didn’t turn back until the war was won!</verse>
				<verse number="38">I smashed them to pieces and I finished them once and for all; they’re as good as dead.</verse>
				<verse number="39">You’ve placed your armor upon me and made my enemies bow low at my feet.</verse>
				<verse number="40">You’ve made them all turn tail and run, for through you I’ve destroyed them all!</verse>
				<verse number="41">They shouted for help, but no one dared to rescue them. They cried out to Yahweh, but he refused to answer them.</verse>
				<verse number="42">So I pulverized them to powder and cast them to the wind. I swept them away like dirt on the floor.</verse>
				<verse number="43">You gave me victory on every side, for you make me a leader of nations. Even those I’ve never heard of come and bow at my feet.</verse>
				<verse number="44">As soon as they heard of me they submitted to me. Even the rebel foreigners obey my every word.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Their rebellion fades away as they come near; trembling in their strongholds, they come crawling out of their hideouts, cringing in fear before me.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Yahweh lives! Praise is lifted high to the unshakable God! Towering over all, my Savior-God is worthy to be praised!</verse>
				<verse number="47">Look how he pays back harm to all who harm me, subduing all who come against me.</verse>
				<verse number="48">He rescues me from my enemies; he lifts me up high and keeps me out of reach, far from the grasp of my violent foe.</verse>
				<verse number="49">So I thank you, Yahweh, with my praises! I will sing my song to the highest God, so all among the nations will hear me.</verse>
				<verse number="50">You have given me, your king, great victories. You’ve always been tender and kind to me, your anointed one, your loving servant, David, and to all my descendants!</verse>

				<verse number="6">So why would I fear the future? Only goodness and tender love pursue me all the days of my life. Then afterward, when my life is through, I’ll return to your glorious presence to be forever with you!</verse>

			<chapter number="24">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh claims the world as his. Everything and everyone belong to him!</verse>
				<verse number="2">He’s the one who pushed back oceans to let the dry ground appear, planting firm foundations for the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Who, then, is allowed to ascend the mountain of Yahweh? And who has the privilege of entering into God’s Holy Place?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Those who are clean—whose works and ways are pure, whose hearts are true and sealed by the truth, those who never deceive, whose words are sure.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They will receive Yahweh ’s blessing and righteousness given by the Savior-God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They will stand before God, for they seek the pleasure of God’s face, the God of Jacob.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So wake up, you living gateways! Lift up your heads, you doorways of eternity! Welcome the King of Glory, for he is about to come through you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You ask, “Who is this King of Glory?” Yahweh, armed and ready for battle, Yahweh, invincible in every way!</verse>
				<verse number="9">So wake up, you living gateways, and rejoice! Fling wide, you eternal doors! Here he comes; the King of Glory is ready to come in.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You ask, “Who is this King of Glory?” He is Yahweh, armed and ready for battle, the Mighty One, the invincible commander of heaven’s hosts! Yes, he is the King of Glory!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="25">
				<verse number="1">Always I will lift up my soul into your presence, Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Be there for me, my God, for I keep trusting in you. Don’t allow my foes to gloat over me or the shame of defeat to overtake me.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Could anyone be disgraced when he has entwined his heart with yours? But my foes will all be defeated and ashamed when they harm the innocent.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Direct me, Yahweh, throughout my journey so I can experience your plans for my life. Reveal the life-paths that are pleasing to you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Escort me into your truth; take me by the hand and teach me. For you are the God of my salvation; I have wrapped my heart into yours all day long!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Forgive my failures as a young man, and overlook the sins of my immaturity. Give me grace, Yahweh! Always look at me through your eyes of love— your forgiving eyes of mercy and compassion. When you think of me, see me as one you love and care for.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">How good you are to me! When people turn to you, Yahweh, they discover how easy you are to please—so faithful and true! Joyfully you teach them the proper path, even when they go astray.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Keep showing the humble your path, and lead them into the best decision. Bring revelation-light that trains them in the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Loving are all the ways of Yahweh, loving and faithful for those who keep his covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For the honor of your name, Yahweh, never count my many sins, and forgive them all— lift their burden off of my life!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Who are they that live in the holy fear of Yahweh? You will show them the right path to take.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then prosperity and favor will be their portion, and their descendants will inherit the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="14">There’s a private place reserved for the devoted lovers of Yahweh, where they sit near him and receive the revelation-secrets of his promises.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Rescue me, Yahweh, for you free my feet from every trap.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Sorrows fill my heart as I feel helpless, mistreated— I’m all alone and in misery! Come closer to me now, for I need your mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Turn to me, for my problems seem to be going from bad to worse. Only you can free me from all these troubles!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Until you lift this burden, the burden of all my sins, my troubles and trials will be more than I can handle. Can’t you feel my pain?</verse>
				<verse number="19">Vicious, violent enemies hate me. There are so many, Lord. Can’t you see?</verse>
				<verse number="20">Will you protect me from their power against me? I have taken shelter in you. Let it never be said that when I trusted you, you didn’t come to my rescue.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Your perfection and faithfulness are my bodyguards, for you are my hope and I trust in you as my only protection.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Zealously, God, we ask you to come save Israel from all her troubles, for you provide the ransom price for your people!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="26">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh, be my judge and declare me innocent! Clear my name, for I walk in integrity and trust you without wavering.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh, you can scrutinize me. Refine my heart and probe my every thought. Put me to the test and you’ll find me true.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I will never lose sight of your steadfast love for me. Your faithfulness has steadied my steps.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I won’t keep company with tricky, two-faced men, nor will I go the way of those with hidden motives.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I despise the sinner’s hangouts. You won’t find me walking with the wicked.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When I come to your altar, Yahweh, I’ll be clean before you, approaching with songs of thanksgiving, singing songs of your mighty miracles.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh, I love to live in your house, this dwelling place of dazzling glory!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Don’t treat me as one of these scheming sinners who plot violence against the innocent.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Look how they devise their wicked plans; their hands are always ready to receive a bribe.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I’m not like them, Lord—not at all. Save me, redeem me with your mercy, for I have chosen to walk only in what is right.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Among the worshipers I will praise Yahweh, for I am safe and secure because of you!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="27">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh is my revelation-light and the source of my salvation. I fear no one! I’ll never turn back and run, for you, Yahweh, surround and protect me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When evil ones come to destroy me, they will be the ones who turn back.</verse>
				<verse number="3">My heart will not fear even if an army rises to attack. I will not be shaken, even if war is imminent.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Here’s the one thing I crave from Yahweh, the one thing I seek above all else: I want to live with him every moment in his house, beholding the marvelous beauty of Yahweh, filled with awe, delighting in his glory and grace. I want to contemplate in his temple.</verse>
				<verse number="5">In the day of trouble, he will treasure me in his shelter, under the cover of his tent. He will lift me high upon a rock, out of reach from all my enemies who surround me. Triumphant now, I’ll bring him my offerings of praise, singing and shouting with ecstatic joy! Yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">Hear my cry. Show me mercy, and send the help I need!</verse>
				<verse number="8">I heard your voice in my heart say, “Come, seek my face;” my inner being responded, “ Yahweh, I’m seeking your face with all my heart.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">So don’t turn your face away from me. You’re the God of my salvation; how can you reject your servant in anger? You’ve been my only hope, so don’t forsake me now when I need you!</verse>
				<verse number="10">My father and mother abandoned me. But you, Yahweh, took me in and made me yours.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now teach me, Yahweh, all about your ways and tell me what to do. Make it clear for me to understand, for I am surrounded by waiting enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Don’t let them defeat me, Lord. You can’t let me fall into their clutches! They keep accusing me of things I’ve never done, breathing out violence against me.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yet I believe with all my heart that I will see again your goodness, Yahweh, in the land of life eternal!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Here’s what I’ve learned through it all: Don’t give up; don’t be impatient; be entwined as one with the Lord. Be brave and courageous, and never lose hope. Yes, keep on waiting— for he will never disappoint you!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="28">
				<verse number="1">I’m pleading with you, Yahweh, help me! Don’t close your ears to my cry, for you’re my defender. If you continue to remain aloof and refuse to answer me, I might as well give up and die.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Hear my cry for help as I turn toward your mercy seat, as I lift my hands toward your sacred sanctuary.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Don’t allow me to be punished along with the wicked— these hypocrites who speak sweetly to their neighbors’ faces while holding evil against them in their hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Go ahead and punish them as they deserve. Let them be paid back for all their evil plans in proportion to their wickedness.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Since they don’t care anything about you, or understand the great things you’ve done, take them down like an old building being demolished, never again to be rebuilt.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But Yahweh, may your name be blessed and built up! For you have answered my passionate cry for mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yahweh is my strength and my wraparound shield. When I fully trust in you, help is on the way. I jump for joy and burst forth with ecstatic, passionate praise! I will sing songs of what you mean to me!</verse>
				<verse number="8">You will be the inner strength of all your people, Yahweh, the mighty protector of all, and the saving strength for all your anointed ones.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Save your people whom you love, and bless your chosen ones. Be our shepherd leading us forward, forever carrying us in your arms!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="29">
				<verse number="1">Proclaim his majesty, all you mighty sons of Yahweh, giving all the glory and strength back to him!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Be in awe before his majesty. Be in awe before such power and might! Come worship wonderful Yahweh, arrayed in all his splendor, bowing in worship as he appears in the beauty of holiness. Give him the honor due his name. Worship him wearing the glory-garments of your holy, priestly calling!</verse>
				<verse number="3">The voice of the Lord echoes through the skies and seas. The Glory-God reigns as he thunders in the clouds. So powerful is his voice, so brilliant and bright— how majestic as he thunders over the great waters!</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">His tympanic thunder topples the strongest of trees. His symphonic sound splinters the mighty forests.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now he moves Zion’s mountains by the might of his voice, shaking the snowy peaks with his earsplitting sound!</verse>
				<verse number="7">The lightning-fire flashes, striking as he speaks.</verse>
				<verse number="8">God reveals himself when he makes the fault lines quake, shaking deserts, speaking his voice.</verse>
				<verse number="9">God’s mighty voice makes the deer to give birth. His thunderbolt-voice lays the forest bare. In his temple all fall before him with each one shouting, “Glory, glory, the God of glory!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Above the furious flood, the Enthroned One reigns, the King-God rules with eternity at his side.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This is the one who gives his strength and might to his people. This is the Lord giving us his kiss of peace.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="30">
				<verse number="1">Lord, I will exalt you and lift you high, for you have lifted me up on high! Over all my boasting, gloating enemies, you made me to triumph.</verse>
				<verse number="2">O Lord, my healing God, I cried out for a miracle and you healed me!</verse>
				<verse number="3">You brought me back from the brink of death, from the depths below. Now here I am, alive and well, fully restored!</verse>
				<verse number="4">O sing and make melody, you steadfast lovers of God. Give thanks to him every time you reflect on his holiness!</verse>
				<verse number="5">I’ve learned that his anger lasts for a moment, but his loving favor lasts a lifetime! We may weep through the night, but at daybreak it will turn into shouts of ecstatic joy.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I remember boasting, “I’ve got it made! Nothing can stop me now! I’m God’s favored one; he’s made me steady as a mountain!” But then suddenly, you hid your face from me. I was panic-stricken and became depressed.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">Still I cried out to you, Lord God. I shouted out for mercy, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="9">“What would you gain in my death, if I were to go down to the depths of darkness? Will a grave sing your song? How could death’s dust declare your faithfulness?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So hear me now, Lord; show me your famous mercy. O God, be my Savior and rescue me!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then he broke through and transformed all my wailing into a whirling dance of ecstatic praise! He has torn the veil and lifted from me the sad heaviness of mourning. He wrapped me in the glory-garments of gladness.</verse>
				<verse number="12">How could I be silent when it’s time to praise you? Now my heart sings out, bursting with joy— a bliss inside that keeps me singing, “I can never thank you enough!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="31">
				<verse number="1">I trust you, Lord, to be my hiding place. Don’t let me down. Don’t let my enemies bring me to shame. Come and rescue me, for you are the only God who always does what is right.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Rescue me quickly when I cry out to you. At the sound of my prayer may your ear be turned to me. Be my strong shelter and hiding place on high. Pull me into victory and breakthrough.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For you are my high fortress, where I’m kept safe. You are to me a stronghold of salvation. When you deliver me out of this peril, it will bring glory to your name. As you guide me forth I’ll be kept safe from the hidden snares of the enemy— the secret traps that lie before me— for you have become my rock of strength.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">Into your hands I now entrust my spirit. O Lord, the God of faithfulness, you have rescued and redeemed me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I despise these deceptive illusions, all this pretense and nonsense, for I worship only you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">In mercy you have seen my troubles, and you have cared for me; even during this crisis in my soul I will be radiant with joy, filled with praise for your love and mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You have kept me from being conquered by my enemy; you broke open the way to bring me to freedom, into a beautiful, broad place.</verse>
				<verse number="9">O Lord, help me again! Keep showing me such mercy. For I am in anguish, always in tears, and I’m worn out with weeping. I’m becoming old because of grief; my health is broken.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I’m exhausted! My life is spent with sorrow, my years with sighing and sadness. Because of all these troubles, I have no more strength. My inner being is so weak and frail.</verse>
				<verse number="11">My enemies say, “You are nothing!” Even my friends and neighbors hold me in contempt! They dread seeing me, and they look the other way when I pass by.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I am totally forgotten, buried away like a dead man, discarded like a broken dish thrown in the trash.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I overheard their whispered threats, the slander of my enemies. I’m terrified as they plot and scheme to take my life.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I’m desperate, Lord! I throw myself upon you, for you alone are my God!</verse>
				<verse number="15">My life, my every moment, my destiny—it’s all in your hands. So I know you can deliver me from those who persecute me relentlessly.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Smile on me, your servant. Let your undying love and glorious grace save me from all this gloom.</verse>
				<verse number="17">As I call upon you, let my shame and disgrace be replaced by your favor once again. But let shame and disgrace fall instead upon the wicked— those going to their own doom, drifting down in silence to the dust of death.</verse>
				<verse number="18">At last their lying lips will be muted in their graves. For they are arrogant, filled with contempt and conceit as they speak against the godly.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Lord, how wonderful you are! You have stored up so many good things for us, like a treasure chest heaped up and spilling over with blessings— all for those who honor and worship you! Everybody knows what you can do for those who turn and hide themselves in you.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So hide all your beloved ones in the sheltered, secret place before your face. Overshadow them with your glory-presence. Keep them from these accusations, the brutal insults of evil men. Tuck them safely away in the tabernacle where you dwell.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The name of the Lord is blessed and lifted high! For his marvelous miracle of mercy protected me when I was overwhelmed by my enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I spoke hastily when I said, “The Lord has deserted me.” For in truth, you did hear my prayer and came to rescue me.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Listen to me, all you godly ones: Love the Lord with passion! The Lord protects and preserves all those who are loyal to him. But he pays back in full all those who reject him in their pride.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So cheer up! Take courage, all you who love him. Wait for him to break through for you, all who trust in him!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="32">
				<verse number="1">What bliss belongs to the one whose rebellion has been forgiven, those whose sins are covered by blood.</verse>
				<verse number="2">What bliss belongs to those who have confessed their corruption to God! For he wipes their slates clean and removes hypocrisy from their hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Before I confessed my sins, I kept it all inside; my dishonesty devastated my inner life, causing my life to be filled with frustration, irrepressible anguish, and misery.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The pain never let up, for your hand of conviction was heavy on my heart. My strength was sapped, my inner life dried up like a spiritual drought within my soul.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then I finally admitted to you all my sins, refusing to hide them any longer. I said, “My life-giving God, I will openly acknowledge my evil actions.” And you forgave me! All at once the guilt of my sin washed away and all my pain disappeared!</verse>
				<verse number="6">This is what I’ve learned through it all: All believers should confess their sins to God; do it every time God has uncovered you in the time of exposing. For if you do this, when sudden storms of life overwhelm, you’ll be kept safe.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Lord, you are my secret hiding place, protecting me from these troubles, surrounding me with songs of gladness! Your joyous shouts of rescue release my breakthrough.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I hear the Lord saying, “I will stay close to you, instructing and guiding you along the pathway for your life. I will advise you along the way and lead you forth with my eyes as your guide. So don’t make it difficult; don’t be stubborn when I take you where you’ve not been before. Don’t make me tug you and pull you along. Just come with me!”</verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10">So my conclusion is this: Many are the sorrows and frustrations of those who don’t come clean with God. But when you trust in the Lord for forgiveness, his wraparound love will surround you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So celebrate the goodness of God! He shows this kindness to everyone who is his. Go ahead—shout for joy, all you upright ones who want to please him!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="33">
				<verse number="1">It’s time to sing and shout for joy! Go ahead, all you redeemed ones, do it! Praise him with all you have, for praise looks lovely on the lips of God’s devoted lovers.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Play the guitar as you lift your praises loaded with thanksgiving. Sing and make joyous music with all you’ve got inside.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Compose new melodies that release new praises to the Lord. Play his praises on instruments with the anointing and skill he gives you. Sing and shout with passion; make a spectacular sound of joy—</verse>
				<verse number="4">For God’s Word is something to sing about! He is true to his promises, his word can be trusted, and everything he does is reliable and right.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The Lord loves seeing justice on the earth. Anywhere and everywhere you can find his faithful, unfailing love!</verse>
				<verse number="6">All he had to do was speak by his Spirit-Wind command, and God created the heavenlies. Filled with galaxies and stars, the vast cosmos he wonderfully made.</verse>
				<verse number="7">His voice scooped out the seas. The ocean depths he poured into vast reservoirs.</verse>
				<verse number="8">With breathtaking wonder, let everyone worship Yahweh, this awe-inspiring Creator.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He breathed words and worlds were birthed. “Let there be,” and there it was— springing forth the moment he spoke, no sooner said than done!</verse>
				<verse number="10">With his breath he scatters the schemes of nations who oppose him; they will never succeed.</verse>
				<verse number="11">His destiny-plan for the earth stands sure. His forever-plan remains in place and will never fail.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Blessed and prosperous is that nation who has God as their Lord! They will be the people he has chosen for his own.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The Lord looks over us from where he rules in heaven. Gazing into every heart from his lofty dwelling place, he observes all the peoples of the earth. The Creator of our hearts considers and examines everything we do.</verse>
				<verse number="14"></verse>
				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16">Even if a king had the best-equipped army, it would never be enough to save him. Even if the best warrior went to battle, he could not be saved simply by his strength alone.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Human strength and the weapons of man are false hopes for victory; they may seem mighty, but they will always disappoint.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The eyes of the Lord are upon even the weakest worshipers who love him— those who wait in hope and expectation for the strong, steady love of God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">God will deliver them from death, even the certain death of famine, with no one to help.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The Lord alone is our radiant hope and we trust in him with all our hearts. His wraparound presence will strengthen us.</verse>
				<verse number="21">As we trust, we rejoice with an uncontained joy flowing from Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="22">Let your love and steadfast kindness overshadow us continually, for we trust and we wait upon you!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="34">
				<verse number="1">Lord! I’m bursting with joy over what you’ve done for me! My lips are full of perpetual praise.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I’m boasting of you and all your works, so let all who are discouraged take heart.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Join me, everyone! Let’s praise the Lord together. Let’s make him famous! Let’s make his name glorious to all.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Listen to my testimony: I cried to God in my distress and he answered me. He freed me from all my fears!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Gaze upon him, join your life with his, and joy will come. Your faces will glisten with glory. You’ll never wear that shame-face again.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When I had nothing, desperate and defeated, I cried out to the Lord and he heard me, bringing his miracle-deliverance when I needed it most.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The angel of Yahweh stooped down to listen as I prayed, encircling me, empowering me, and showing me how to escape. He will do this for everyone who fears God.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Drink deeply of the pleasures of this God. Experience for yourself the joyous mercies he gives to all who turn to hide themselves in him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Worship in awe and wonder, all you who’ve been made holy! For all who fear him will feast with plenty.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Even the strong and the wealthy grow weak and hungry, but those who passionately pursue the Lord will never lack any good thing.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Come, children of God, and listen to me. I’ll share the lesson I’ve learned of fearing the Lord:</verse>
				<verse number="12">Do you want to live a long, good life, enjoying the beauty that fills each day? Then never speak a lie or allow wicked words to come from your mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">Keep turning your back on every sin, and make “peace” your life motto. Practice being at peace with everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The Lord sees all we do; he watches over his friends day and night. His godly ones receive the answers they seek whenever they cry out to him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But the Lord has made up his mind to oppose evildoers and to wipe out even the memory of them from the face of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yet when holy lovers of God cry out to him with all their hearts, the Lord will hear them and come to rescue them from all their troubles.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The Lord is close to all whose hearts are crushed by pain, and he is always ready to restore the repentant one.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Even when bad things happen to the good and godly ones, the Lord will save them and not let them be defeated by what they face.</verse>
				<verse number="20">God will be your bodyguard to protect you when trouble is near. Not one bone will be broken.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Evil will cause the death of the wicked, for they hate and persecute the devoted lovers of God. Make no mistake about it: God will hold them guilty and punish them; they will pay the penalty!</verse>
				<verse number="22">But the Lord has paid for the freedom of his servants, and he will freely pardon those who love him. He will declare them free and innocent when they turn to hide themselves in him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="35">
				<verse number="1">O Lord, fight for me! Harass the hecklers; accuse my accusers. Fight those who fight against me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Put on your armor, Lord; take up your shield and protect me. Rise up, mighty God! Grab your weapons of war and block the way of the wicked who come to fight me. Stand for me when they stand against me! Speak over my soul: “I am your strong Savior!”</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">Humiliate those who seek my harm. Defeat them all! Frustrate their plans to defeat me and drive them back. Disgrace them all as they have devised their plans to disgrace me.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Blow them away like dust in the wind, with the angel of Almighty God driving them back!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Make the road in front of them nothing but slippery darkness, with the angel of Yahweh behind them, chasing them away!</verse>
				<verse number="7">For though I did nothing wrong to them, they set a trap for me, wanting me to fail and fall.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Surprise them with your ambush, Lord, and catch them in the very trap they set for me. Let them be the ones to fail and fall into destruction!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then my fears will dissolve into limitless joy; my whole being will overflow with gladness because of your mighty deliverance.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Everything inside of me will shout it out: “There’s no one like you, Lord!” For look at how you protect the weak and helpless from the strong and heartless who oppress them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They are malicious men, hostile witnesses of wrong. They rise up against me, accusers appearing out of nowhere.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When I show them mercy, they bring me misery. I’m forsaken and forlorn, like a motherless child.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I even prayed over them when they were sick. I was burdened and bowed low with fasting and interceded for their healing, and I didn’t stop praying.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I grieved for them, heavyhearted, as though they were my dearest family members or my good friends who were sick, nearing death, needing prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But when I was the one who tripped up and stumbled, they came together to slander me, rejoicing in my time of trouble, tearing me to shreds with their lies and betrayal.</verse>
				<verse number="16">These nameless ruffians, mocking me like godless fools at a feast— how they delight in throwing mud on my name.</verse>
				<verse number="17">God, how long can you just stand there doing nothing? Now is the time to act. Rescue me from these brutal men, for I am being torn to shreds by these beasts who are out to get me. Save me from their rage, their cruel grasp.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then I will praise you wherever I go. And when everyone gathers for worship, I will lift up your praise with a shout in front of the largest crowd I can find!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Don’t let those who fight me for no reason be victorious. Don’t let them succeed, these heartless haters who come against me with their gloating sneers.</verse>
				<verse number="20">They are the ones who would never seek peace as friends, for they are ever devising deceit against the innocent ones who mind their own business.</verse>
				<verse number="21">They open their mouths with ugly grins, gloating with glee over my every fault. “Look,” they say, “we caught him red-handed! We saw him fall with our own eyes!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Yahweh, my caring God, you have been there all along. You have seen their hypocrisy. Yahweh, don’t let them get away with this. Don’t walk away without doing something.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now is the time to awake! Rise up, Lord! Vindicate me, my Lord and my God!</verse>
				<verse number="24">You have every right to judge me, Lord, according to your righteousness, but don’t let them rejoice over me when I stumble.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Let them all be ashamed of themselves, humiliated when they rejoice over my every blunder. Shame them, Lord, when they say, “We saw what he did. Now we have him right where we want him. Let’s get him while he’s down!” Make them look ridiculous when they exalt themselves over me. May they all be disgraced and dishonored!</verse>
				<verse number="26"></verse>
				<verse number="27">But let all my true friends shout for joy, all those who know and love what I do for you. Let them all say, “The Lord is great, and he delights in the prosperity of his servant.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then I won’t be able to hold it in— everyone will hear my joyous praises all day long! Your righteousness will be the theme of my glory-song of praise!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="36">
				<verse number="1">The rebellion of sin speaks as an oracle of God, speaking deeply to the conscience of wicked men. Yet they are still eager to sin, for the fear of God is not before their eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="2">See how they flatter themselves, unable to detect and detest their sins. They are crooked and conceited, convinced they can get away with anything.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Their wicked words are nothing but lies. Wisdom is far from them. Goodness is both forgotten and forsaken.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They lie awake at night to hatch their evil plots, always planning their schemes of darkness, and never once do they consider the evil of their ways.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But you, O Lord, your mercy-seat love is limitless, reaching higher than the highest heavens. Your great faithfulness is infinite, stretching over the whole earth.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Your righteousness is unmovable, just like the mighty mountains. Your judgments are as full of wisdom as the oceans are full of water. Your tender care and kindness leave no one forgotten, not a man or even a mouse.</verse>
				<verse number="7">O God, how extravagant is your cherishing love! All mankind can find a hiding place under the shadow of your wings.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All may drink of the anointing from the abundance of your house. All may drink their fill from the rivers of Eden.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The fountain of life flows from you to satisfy me. In your light of holiness we receive the light of revelation.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Lord, keep pouring out your unfailing love on those who are near you. Release more of your blessings to those who are loyal to you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Don’t let these proud boasters trample me down; don’t let them push me around by the sheer strength of their wickedness.</verse>
				<verse number="12">There they lie in the dirt, these evil ones, thrown down to the ground, never to arise again!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="37">
				<verse number="1">Don’t follow after the wicked ones or be jealous of their wealth. Don’t think for a moment they’re better off than you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They and their short-lived success will soon shrivel up and quickly fade away, like grass clippings in the hot sun.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Keep trusting in the Lord and do what is right in his eyes. Fix your heart on the promises of God, and you will dwell in the land, feasting on his faithfulness.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Find your delight and true pleasure in Yahweh, and he will give you what you desire the most.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Give God the right to direct your life, and as you trust him along the way, you’ll find he pulled it off perfectly!</verse>
				<verse number="6">He will appear as your righteousness, as sure as the dawning of a new day. He will manifest as your justice, as sure and strong as the noonday sun.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Quiet your heart in his presence and wait patiently for Yahweh. And don’t think for a moment that the wicked, in their prosperity, are better off than you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Stay away from anger and revenge. Keep envy far from you, for it only leads you into lies.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For one day the wicked will be destroyed, but those who trust in the Lord will inherit the land.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Just a little while longer and the ungodly will vanish; you will look for them in vain.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But the humble of heart will inherit every promise and enjoy abundant peace.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Let the wicked keep plotting against the godly with all their sneers and arrogant jeers.</verse>
				<verse number="13">God laughs at the wicked and their plans, for he knows their day is coming!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Evil ones take aim at the poor and helpless; they are ready to slaughter those who do right.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But the Lord will turn all their weapons of wickedness back on themselves, piercing their pride-filled hearts until they are helpless.</verse>
				<verse number="16">It is much better to have little combined with much of God than to have the fabulous wealth of the wicked and nothing else.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the Lord takes care of all his forgiven ones while the strength of evil men will surely slip away.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Day by day the Lord watches the good deeds of the godly, and he prepares for them his forever-reward.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Even in a time of disaster he will watch over them, and they will always have more than enough no matter what happens.</verse>
				<verse number="20">All the enemies of God will perish. For the wicked have only a momentary value, a fading glory. Then one day they vanish! Here today, gone tomorrow.</verse>
				<verse number="21">They break their promises, borrowing money but never paying it back. The good man returns what he owes with some extra besides.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Yahweh ’s blessed ones receive the land, but the cursed ones will be cut off with nothing to show for themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="23">When Yahweh delights in how you live your life, he establishes your every step.</verse>
				<verse number="24">If they stumble badly they will still survive, for the Lord lifts them up with his hands.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I was once inexperienced, but now I’m old. Not once have I found a lover of God forsaken by him, nor have any of their children gone hungry.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Instead, I’ve found the godly ones to be the generous ones who give freely to others. Their children are blessed and become a blessing.</verse>
				<verse number="27">If you truly want to dwell forever in God’s presence, forsake evil and do what is right in his eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="28">The Lord loves it when he sees us walking in his justice. He will never desert his devoted lovers; they will be kept forever in his faithful care, but the descendants of the wicked will be banished.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The faithful lovers of God will inherit the earth and enjoy every promise of God’s care, dwelling in peace forever.</verse>
				<verse number="30">God-lovers make the best counselors. Their words possess wisdom and are right and trustworthy.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The ways of God are in their hearts and they won’t swerve from the paths of steadfast righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Evil ones spy on the godly ones, stalking them to find something they could use to accuse them. They’re out for the kill!</verse>
				<verse number="33">But God will foil all their plots. The godly will not stand condemned when brought to trial.</verse>
				<verse number="34">So don’t be impatient for Yahweh to act; keep moving forward steadily in his ways, and he will exalt you to possess the land. You’ll watch with your own eyes and see the wicked lose everything.</verse>
				<verse number="35">I’ve already seen this happen. Once I saw a wicked and violent man overpower all who were around him, a domineering tyrant with his prideful and oppressive ways.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then he died and was forgotten. Now no one cares that he is gone forever.</verse>
				<verse number="37">But you can tell who are the blameless and spiritually mature. What a different story with them! The godly ones will have a peaceful, prosperous future with a happy ending.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Every evil sinner will be destroyed, obliterated. They’ll be utter failures with no future!</verse>
				<verse number="39">But the Lord will be the Savior of all who love him. Even in their time of trouble, God will live in them as strength.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Because of their faith in him, their daily portion will be a Father’s help and deliverance from evil. This is true for all who turn to hide themselves in him!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="38">
				<verse number="1">O Lord, don’t punish me angrily for what I’ve done. Don’t let my sin inflame your wrath against me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For the arrows of your conviction have pierced me deeply. Your blows have struck my soul and crushed me.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now my body is sick. My health is totally broken because of your anger, and it’s all due to my sins!</verse>
				<verse number="4">I’m overwhelmed, swamped, and submerged beneath the heavy burden of my guilt. It clings to me and won’t let me go.</verse>
				<verse number="5">My rotting wounds are a witness against me. They are severe and getting worse, reminding me of my failure and folly.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I am completely broken because of what I’ve done. Gloom is all around me. My sins have bent me over to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="7">My inner being is shriveled up; my self-confidence crushed. Sick with fever, I’m left exhausted. Now I’m as cold as a corpse, and nothing is left inside me but great groaning filled with anguish.</verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">Lord, you know all my desires and deepest longings. My tears are liquid words, and you can read them all.</verse>
				<verse number="10">My heart beats wildly, my strength is sapped, and the light of my eyes is going out. My friends stay far away from me, avoiding me like the plague. Even my family wants nothing to do with me.</verse>
				<verse number="11"></verse>
				<verse number="12">Meanwhile my enemies are out to kill me, plotting my ruin, speaking of my doom as they spend every waking moment planning how to finish me off.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I’m like a deaf man who no longer hears. I can’t even speak up, and words fail me; I have no argument to counter their threats.</verse>
				<verse number="14"></verse>
				<verse number="15">Lord, the only thing I can do is wait and put my hope in you. I wait for your help, my God.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So hear my cry and put an end to their strutting in pride, to those who gloat when I stumble in pain.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I’m slipping away and on the verge of a breakdown, with nothing but sorrow and sighing.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I confess all my sin to you; I can’t hold it in any longer. My agonizing thoughts punish me for my wrongdoing; I feel condemned as I consider all I’ve done.</verse>
				<verse number="19">My enemies are many. They hate me and persecute me, though I’ve done nothing against them to deserve it.</verse>
				<verse number="20">I show goodness to them and get paid evil in return. And they hate me even more when I stand for what is right.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So don’t forsake me now, Lord! Don’t leave me in this condition.</verse>
				<verse number="22">God, hurry to help me. Run to my rescue! For you’re my Savior and my only hope!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="39">
				<verse number="1">Here’s my life motto, the truth I live by: I will guard my ways for all my days. I will speak only what is right, guarding what I speak. Like a watchman guards against an attack of the enemy, I’ll guard and muzzle my mouth when the wicked are around me. I will remain silent and will not grumble or speak out of my disappointment. But the longer I’m silent, the more my pain grows worse!</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">My heart burned with a fire within me, and my thoughts eventually boiled over until they finally came rolling out of my mouth: “Lord, help me to know how fleeting my time on earth is. Help me to know how limited is my life and that I’m only here but for a moment more.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">What a brief time you’ve given me to live! Compared to you my lifetime is nothing at all! Nothing more than a puff of air—I’m gone so swiftly. So too are the grandest of men; they are nothing but a fleeting shadow!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">We live our lives like those living in shadows. All our activities and energies are spent for things that pass away. We gather, we hoard, we cling to our things, only to leave them all behind for who knows who.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And now, God, I’m left with one conclusion: my only hope is to hope in you alone!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Save me from being overpowered by my sin; don’t make me a disgrace before the degenerate.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Lord, I’m left speechless and I have no excuse, so I’ll not complain any longer. Now I know you’re the one who is behind it all.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But I can’t take it much longer. Spare me these blows from your discipline-rod. For if you are against me, I will waste away to nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="11">No one endures when you rebuke and discipline us for our sins. Like a cobweb is swept away with a wave of the hand, you sweep away all that we once called dear. How fleeting and frail our lives! We’re nothing more than a puff of air.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Lord, listen to all my tender cries. Read my every tear, like liquid words that plead for your help. I feel all alone at times, like a stranger to you, passing through this life just like all those before me.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Don’t let me die without restoring joy and gladness to my soul. May your frown over my failure become a smile over my success.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="40">
				<verse number="1">I waited and waited and waited some more, patiently, knowing God would come through for me. Then, at last, he bent down and listened to my cry.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He stooped down to lift me out of danger from the desolate pit I was in, out of the muddy mess I had fallen into. Now he’s lifted me up into a firm, secure place and steadied me while I walk along his ascending path.</verse>
				<verse number="3">A new song for a new day rises up in me every time I think about how he breaks through for me! Ecstatic praise pours out of my mouth until everyone hears how God has set me free. Many will see his miracles; they’ll stand in awe of God and fall in love with him!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Blessing after blessing comes to those who love and trust the Lord. They will not fall away, for they refuse to listen to the lies of the proud.</verse>
				<verse number="5">O Lord, our God, no one can compare with you. Such wonderful works and miracles are all found with you! And you think of us all the time with your countless expressions of love— far exceeding our expectations!</verse>
				<verse number="6">It’s not sacrifices that really move your heart. Burnt offerings, sin offerings—those aren’t what bring you joy. But when you open my ears and speak to me, I become your willing servant, your prisoner of love for life.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So I said, “Here I am! I’m coming to you as a sacrifice, for in the prophetic scrolls of your book you have written about me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I delight to fulfill your will, my God, for your living words are written upon the pages of my heart.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">I tell everyone everywhere the truth of your righteousness. And you know I haven’t held back in telling the message to all.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I don’t keep it a secret or hide the truth. I preach of your faithfulness and kindness, proclaiming your extravagant love to the largest crowd I can find!</verse>
				<verse number="11">So Lord, don’t hold back your love or withhold your tender mercies from me. Keep me in your truth and let your compassion overflow to me no matter what I face.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Evil surrounds me; problems greater than I can solve come one after another. Without you, I know I can’t make it. My sins are so many! I’m so ashamed to lift my face to you. For my guilt grabs me and stings my soul until I am weakened and spent.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Please, Lord! Come quickly and rescue me! Take pleasure in showing me your favor and restore me.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Let all who seek my life be humiliated! Let them be confused and ashamed, God. Scatter those who wish me evil; they just want me dead.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Scoff at every scoffer and cause them all to be utter failures. Let them be ashamed and horrified by their complete defeat.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But let all who passionately seek you erupt with excitement and joy over what you’ve done! Let all your devoted lovers rejoice continually in the Savior, saying, “How great and glorious is our God!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Lord, in my place of weakness and need, I ask again: Will you come and help me? I know I’m always in your thoughts. You are my true Savior and hero, so don’t delay to deliver me now, for you are my God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="41">
				<verse number="1">God always blesses those who are kind to the poor and helpless. They’re the first ones God helps when they find themselves in any trouble.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The Lord will preserve and protect them. They’ll be honored and esteemed while their enemies are defeated.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When they are sick, lying upon their bed of suffering, God will restore them. He will raise them up again and restore them back to health.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So in my sickness I say to you, “Lord, be my kind healer. Heal my body and soul; heal me, God! For I have confessed my sins to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But those who hate me wish the worst for me, saying, “When will he die and be forgotten?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">And when these “friends” come to visit me with their pious sympathy and their hollow words and with hypocrisy hidden in their hearts, I can see right through it all. For they come merely to gather gossip about me, using all they find to mock me with malicious hearts of slander.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They are wicked whisperers who imagine the worst for me, repeating their rumors, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="8">“He got what he deserved; it’s over for him! The spirit of infirmity is upon him, and he’ll never get over this illness.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Even my ally, my friend, has turned against me. He was one I totally trusted with my life, sharing supper with him, and now he shows me nothing but betrayal and treachery. He has sold me as an enemy.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So Lord, please don’t desert me when I need you! Give me grace and get me back on my feet so I can triumph over them all.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then I’ll know you’re pleased with me when you allow me to taste victory over all my foes.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now stand up for me and don’t let me fall, for I’ve walked with integrity. Keep me before your face forever.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Everyone praise the Lord God of Israel, always and forever! For he is from eternity past and will remain for the eternity to come. That’s the way it will be forever. Faithful is our King! Amen!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="42">
				<verse number="1">I long to drink of you, O God, to drink deeply from the streams of pleasure flowing from your presence. My longings overwhelm me for more of you!</verse>
				<verse number="2">My soul thirsts, pants, and longs for the living God. I want to come and see the face of God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Day and night my tears keep falling and my heart keeps crying for your help, while my enemies mock me over and over, saying, “Where is this God of yours? Why doesn’t he help you? ”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So I speak over my heartbroken soul, “Take courage. Remember when you used to be right out front leading the procession of praise when the great crowd of worshipers gathered to go into the presence of the Lord? You shouted with joy as the sound of passionate celebration filled the air and the joyous multitude of lovers honored the feast of the Lord!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So then, my soul, why would you be depressed? Why would you sink into despair? Just keep hoping and waiting on God, your Savior. For no matter what, I will still sing with praise, for you are my saving grace!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Here I am depressed and downcast. Yet I will still remember you as I ponder the place where your glory streams down from the mighty mountaintops, lofty and majestic— the mountains of your awesome presence.</verse>
				<verse number="7">My deep need calls out to the deep kindness of your love. Your waterfall of weeping sent waves of sorrow over my soul, carrying me away, cascading over me like a thundering cataract.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All through the day Yahweh has commanded his endless love to pour over me. Through the night I sing his songs and my praises to the living God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I will say to God, “You are my mountain of strength; how could you forget me? Why must I suffer this vile oppression of my enemies— these heartless tormentors who are out to kill me?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Their wounding words pierce my heart over and over while they say, “Where is this God of yours?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So I say to my soul, “Don’t be discouraged. Don’t be disturbed. For I know my God will break through for me.” Then I’ll have plenty of reasons to praise him all over again. Yes, he is my saving grace!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="43">
				<verse number="1">God, clear my name. Plead my case against the unjust charges of these ungodly workers of wickedness. Deliver me from these lying degenerates.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For you are where my strength comes from and my protector, so why would you leave me now? Must I be covered with gloom while the enemy comes after me, gloating with glee?</verse>
				<verse number="3">Pour into me the brightness of your daybreak! Pour into me your rays of revelation-truth! Let them comfort and gently lead me onto the shining path, showing the way into your burning presence, into your many sanctuaries of holiness.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then I will come closer to your very altar until I come before you, the God of my ecstatic joy! I will praise you with the harp that plays in my heart to you, my God, my magnificent God!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then I will say to my soul, “Don’t be discouraged; don’t be disturbed, for I fully expect my Savior-God to break through for me. Then I’ll have plenty of reasons to praise him all over again.” Yes, he is my saving grace!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="44">
				<verse number="1">God, we’ve heard about all the glorious miracles you’ve done for our ancestors in days gone by. They told us about the ancient times, how by your power you drove out the ungodly nations from this land, crushing all their strongholds and giving the land to us. Now the people of Israel cover the land from one end to the other, all because of your grace and power!</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">Our forefathers didn’t take the land by their own strength or their own skill or strategy. But it was through the shining forth of your radiant presence and the display of your mighty power. You loved to give them victory, for you took great delight in them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You are my God, my King! It’s now time to decree majesties for Jacob!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Through your glorious name and your awesome power, we can push through to any victory and defeat every enemy.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For I will not trust in the weapons of the world; I know they will never save me.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Only you will be our Savior from all our enemies. All those who hate us you have brought to shame.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So now I constantly boast in you. I can never thank you enough!</verse>
				<verse number="9">But you have turned your back on us; you walked off and left us! You’ve rejected us, tossing us aside in humiliating shame. You don’t go before us anymore in our battles.</verse>
				<verse number="10">We retreat before our enemies in defeat, for you are no longer helping us. Those who hate us have invaded our land and plundered our people.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You have treated us like sheep in the slaughter pen, ready to be butchered. You’ve scattered us to the four winds.</verse>
				<verse number="12">You have sold us as slaves for nothing! You have counted us, your precious ones, as worthless.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You have caused our neighbors to despise and scorn us. All those around us mock and curse us.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You have made us the butt of their jokes. Disliked by all, we are the laughingstock of the people.</verse>
				<verse number="15">There’s no escape from this constant curse, this humiliation! We are despised, jeered, overwhelmed by shame, and overcome at every turn by our hateful and heartless enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">Despite all of this, we have not forgotten you; we have not broken covenant with you.</verse>
				<verse number="18">We have not betrayed you; our hearts are still yours. Our steps have not strayed from your path.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yet you have crushed us, leaving us in this wilderness place of misery and desperation. With nowhere else to turn, death’s dark door seems to be the only way out.</verse>
				<verse number="20">If we had forsaken your holy name, wouldn’t you know it? You’d be right in leaving us. If we had worshiped before other gods, no one would blame you for punishing us. God, you know our every heart-secret. You know we still want you!</verse>
				<verse number="21"></verse>
				<verse number="22">Because of you we face death threats every day. Like martyrs we are dying daily. We are seen as lambs lined up to be slaughtered as sacrifices.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So wake up, Lord God! Why would you sleep when we’re in trouble? Are you forsaking us forever?</verse>
				<verse number="24">You can’t hide your face any longer from us! How could you forget our agonizing sorrow?</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now we lay facedown, sinking into the dust of death, the quicksand of the grave.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Arise, awake, and come to help us, O Lord. Let your unfailing love save us from this sorrow!</verse>

				<verse number="4">God has a constantly flowing river whose sparkling streams bring joy and delight to his people. His river flows right through the city of God Most High, into his holy dwelling places.</verse>
				<verse number="5">God is in the midst of his city, secure and never shaken. At daybreak his help will be seen with the appearing of the dawn.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When the nations are in uproar with their tottering kingdoms, God simply raises his voice, and the earth begins to disintegrate before him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Here he comes! The Commander! The mighty Lord of Angel Armies is on our side! The God of Jacob fights for us!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Everyone look! Come and see the breathtaking wonders of our God. For he brings both ruin and revival. He’s the one who makes conflicts end throughout the earth, breaking and burning every weapon of war.</verse>

				<verse number="1">Go ahead and celebrate! Come on and clap your hands, everyone! Shout to God with the raucous sounds of joy!</verse>
				<verse number="2">The Lord God Most High is astonishing, awesome beyond words! He’s the formidable and powerful King over all the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He’s the one who conquered the nations before us and placed them all under our feet.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He’s marked out our inheritance ahead of time, putting us in the front of the line, honoring Jacob, the one he loves.</verse>
				<verse number="5">God arises with the earsplitting shout of his people! God goes up with a trumpet blast!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Sing and celebrate! Sing some more, celebrate some more! Sing your highest song of praise to our King!</verse>
				<verse number="7">For God is the triumphant King; all the powers of the earth are his. So sing your celebration songs of highest praise to the glorious Enlightened One!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Our God reigns over every nation. He reigns on his holy throne over all.</verse>
				<verse number="9">All the nobles and princes, the loving servants of the God of Abraham, they all gather to worship. Every warrior’s shield is now lowered as surrendered trophies before this King. He has taken his throne, high and lofty, exalted over all!</verse>

			<chapter number="48">
				<verse number="1">There are so many reasons to describe God as wonderful! So many reasons to praise him with unlimited praise!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Zion-City is his home; he lives on his holy mountain— high and glorious, joy-filled and favored. Zion-Mountain looms in the farthest reaches of the north, the city of our incomparable King!</verse>
				<verse number="3">This is his divine abode, an impenetrable citadel, for he is known to dwell in the highest place.</verse>
				<verse number="4">See how the mighty kings united to come against Zion, yet when they saw God manifest in front of their eyes, they were stunned. Trembling, they all fled away, gripped with fear. Seized with panic, they doubled up in frightful anguish, like a woman in the labor pains of childbirth.</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">Like a hurricane blowing and breaking the invading ships, God blows upon them and breaks them to pieces.</verse>
				<verse number="8">We have heard about these wonders, and then we saw them with our own eyes. For this is the city of the Commander of Angel Armies, the city of our God, safe and secure forever!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Lord, as we worship you in your temple, we recall over and over your kindness to us and your unending love.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The fame of your name echoes throughout the entire world, accompanied with praises. Your right hand is full of victory.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So let the people of Zion rejoice with gladness; let the daughters of praise leap for joy! For God will see to it that you are judged fairly.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Circle Zion; count her towers. Consider her walls, climb her palaces, and then go and tell the coming generation of the care and compassion of our God.</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">Yes, this is our God, our great God forever. He will lead us onward until the end, through all time, beyond death, and into eternity!</verse>

			<chapter number="49">
				<verse number="1">Listen, one and all! Both rich and poor together, all over the world— everyone listen to what I have to say!</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">For wisdom will come from my mouth; words of insight and understanding will be heard from the musings of my heart.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I will break open mysteries with my music, and my song will release riddles solved.</verse>
				<verse number="5">There’s no reason to fear when troubling times come, even when you’re surrounded with problems and persecutors who chase at your heels.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They trust in their treasures and boast in their riches, yet not one of them, though rich as a king, could rescue his own brother from the guilt of his sins. No one could give God the ransom price for the soul of another, let alone for himself.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">A soul’s redemption is too costly and precious for anyone to pay with earthly wealth. The price to pay is never enough to purchase eternal life for even one, to keep them out of hell.</verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10">The brightest and best, along with the foolish and senseless, God sees that they all will die one day, leaving their houses and wealth to others. Even though they name streets and lands after themselves, hoping to have their memory endure beyond the grave, becoming legends in their own minds, their home address is now the cemetery!</verse>
				<verse number="11"></verse>
				<verse number="12">The honor of man is short-lived and fleeting. There’s little difference between man and beast, for both will one day perish.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Such is the path of foolish men and those who quote everything they say, for they are here today and gone tomorrow!</verse>
				<verse number="14">A shepherd called “Death” herds them, leading them straight to hell like mindless sheep. Yet at daybreak you will find the righteous ruling in their place. Every trace of them will be gone forever, with all their “glory” lost in the darkness of their doom.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But I know the loving God will redeem my soul, raising me up from the dark power of death, taking me as his bridal partner.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So don’t be disturbed when you see the rich surround you with the “glory” of their wealth on full display.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For when they die, they will carry nothing with them, and their riches will not follow them beyond the grave.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Though they have the greatest rewards of this world and all applaud them for their accomplishments, they will follow those who have gone before them and go straight into the realm of darkness, where they will never ever see the light again.</verse>
				<verse number="19"></verse>
				<verse number="20">So this is the way of mortal man— honored for a moment, yet without eternal insight, like a beast that will one day perish.</verse>

				<verse number="1">The God of gods, the mighty Lord himself, has spoken! He shouts out over all the people of the earth in every brilliant sunrise and every beautiful sunset, saying, “Listen to me!”</verse>
				<verse number="2">God’s glory-light shines out of the Zion-realm with the radiance of perfect beauty.</verse>
				<verse number="3">With the rumble of thunder he approaches; he will not be silent, for he comes with an earsplitting sound! All around him are furious flames of fire, and preceding him is the dazzling blaze of his glory.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Here he comes to judge his people! He summons his court with heaven and earth as his jury, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Gather all my devoted lovers, my godly ones whose hearts are one with me— those who have entered into my holy covenant by sacrifices upon the altar.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">And the heavens declare his justice: “God himself will be their judge, and he will judge them with righteousness!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Listen to me, O my people! Listen well, for I am your God! I am bringing you to trial, and here are my charges.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices, which you continually bring to my altar.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Do I need your young bulls or goats from your fields as if I were hungry?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Every animal of field and forest belongs to me, the Creator. I know every movement of the birds in the sky, and every animal of the field is in my thoughts. The entire world and everything it contains is mine.</verse>
				<verse number="11"></verse>
				<verse number="12">If I were hungry, do you think I would tell you? For all that I have created, the fullness of the earth, is mine. Am I fed by your sacrifices? Of course not!</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">Why don’t you bring me the sacrifices I desire? Bring me your true and sincere thanks, and show your gratitude by keeping your promises to me, the Most High.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Honor me by trusting in me in your day of trouble. Cry aloud to me, and I will be there to rescue you.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And now I speak to the wicked. Listen to what I have to say to you! What right do you have to presume to speak for me and claim my covenant promises as yours?</verse>
				<verse number="17">For you have hated my instruction and disregarded my words, throwing them away as worthless!</verse>
				<verse number="18">You forget to condemn the thief or adulterer. You are their friend, running alongside them into darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The sins of your mouth multiply evil. You have a lifestyle of lies; you are devoted to deceit as you speak against others, even slandering those of your own household!</verse>
				<verse number="20"></verse>
				<verse number="21">All this you have done and I kept silent, so you thought that I was just like you, sanctioning evil. But now I will bring you to my courtroom and spell out clearly my charges before you.</verse>
				<verse number="22">This is your last chance, my final warning. Your time is up! Turn away from all this evil, or the next time you hear from me will be when I am coming to pass judgment upon you. I will snatch you away, and no one will be there to help you escape my judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The life that pleases me is a life lived in the gratitude of grace, always choosing to walk with me in what is right. This is the sacrifice I desire from you. If you do this, more of my salvation will unfold for you.”</verse>

			<chapter number="51">
				<verse number="1">God, give me mercy from your fountain of forgiveness! I know your abundant love is enough to wash away my guilt. Because your compassion is so great, take away this shameful guilt of sin. Forgive the full extent of my rebellious ways, and erase this deep stain on my conscience.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">For I’m so ashamed. I feel such pain and anguish within me. I can’t get away from the sting of my sin against you, Lord! Everything I did, I did right in front of you, for you saw it all. Against you, and you above all, have I sinned. Everything you say to me is infallibly true and your judgment conquers me.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">Lord, I have been a sinner from birth, from the moment my mother conceived me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I know that you delight to set your truth deep in my spirit. So come into the hidden places of my heart and teach me wisdom.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Purify my conscience! Make this leper clean again! Wash me in your love until I am pure in heart.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Satisfy me in your sweetness, and my song of joy will return. The places you have crushed within me will rejoice in your healing touch.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Hide my sins from your face; erase all my guilt by your saving grace.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Keep creating in me a clean heart. Fill me with pure thoughts and holy desires, ready to please you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">May you never reject me! May you never take from me your sacred Spirit!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Let my passion for life be restored, tasting joy in every breakthrough you bring to me. Hold me close to you with a willing spirit that obeys whatever you say.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then I can show other guilty ones how loving and merciful you are. They will find their way back home to you, knowing that you will forgive them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">O God, my saving God, deliver me fully from every sin, even the sin that brought bloodguilt. Then my heart will once again be thrilled to sing the passionate songs of joy and deliverance!</verse>
				<verse number="15">Lord God, unlock my heart, unlock my lips, and I will overcome with my joyous praise!</verse>
				<verse number="16">For the source of your pleasure is not in my performance or the sacrifices I might offer to you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The fountain of your pleasure is found in the sacrifice of my shattered heart before you. You will not despise my tenderness as I bow down humbly at your feet.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Because you favor Zion, do what is good for her. Be the protecting wall around Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And when we are fully restored, you will rejoice and take delight in every offering of our lives as we bring our sacrifices of righteousness before you in love!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="52">
				<verse number="1">You call yourself a mighty man, a big shot? Why do you boast in the evil you have done? Yet God’s loyal love will protect me and carry the day!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Listen, O deceiver, trickster of others: Your words are wicked, harming and hurting all who hear them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">You love evil and hate what is good and right. You would rather lie than tell the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You love to distort, devour, and deceive, using your sly tongue to spin the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But the Almighty will strike you down forever! He will pull you up by your roots and drag you away to the darkness of death.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The godly will see all this and will be awestruck. Then they will laugh at the wicked, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="7">“See what happens to those great in their own eyes who don’t trust in the Most High to save them! Look how they trusted only in their wealth and made their living from wickedness.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But I am like a flourishing olive tree, anointed in the house of God. I trust in the unending love of God; his passion toward me is forever and ever.</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="53">
				<verse number="1">Only the withering soul would say to himself, “There’s no God for me!” Anyone who thinks like that is corrupt and callous; depraved and detestable, they are devoid of what is good.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The Lord looks down in love, bending over heaven’s balcony. God looks over all of Adam’s sons and daughters, looking to see if there are any who are wise with insight— any who search for him, wanting to please him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But no, all have wandered astray, walking stubbornly toward evil. Not one is good; he can’t even find one!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Look how they live in luxury while exploiting my people. Won’t these workers of wickedness ever learn! They never even think of praying to God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Soon, unheard-of terror will seize them while in their sins. God himself will one day scatter the bones of those who rose up against you. Doomed and rejected, they will be put to shame, for God has despised them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Oh, I wish our time of rescue were already here. Oh, that God would come forth now — arising from the midst of his Zion-people to save and restore his very own. When God fully restores his people, Jacob will rejoice, and Israel will be filled with gladness!</verse>

				<verse number="1">God, deliver me by your mighty name! Come with your glorious power and save me!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Listen to my prayer; turn your ears to my cry!</verse>
				<verse number="3">These violent men have risen up against me; heartless, ruthless men who care nothing about God seek to take my life.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But the Lord God has become my divine helper. He leans into my heart and lays his hands upon me!</verse>
				<verse number="5">God will see to it that those who sow evil will reap evil. So Lord, in your great faithfulness, destroy them once and for all!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Lord, I will offer myself freely, and everything I am I give to you. I will worship and praise your name, O Lord, for it is precious to me.</verse>

			<chapter number="55">
				<verse number="1">God, listen to my prayer! Don’t hide your heart from me when I cry out to you!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Come close to me and give me your answer. Here I am, moaning and restless. I’m preoccupied with the threats of my enemies and crushed by the pressure of their opposition. They surround me with trouble and terror. In their fury they rise up against me in an angry uproar.</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">My heart is trembling inside my chest as the terror of death seizes me.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Fear and dread overwhelm me. I shudder before the horror I face.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I say to myself, “If only I could fly away from all of this! If only I could run away to the place of rest and peace.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I would run far away where no one could find me, escaping to a wilderness retreat.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">I will hurry off to hide in the higher place, into my shelter, safe from this raging storm and tempest.</verse>
				<verse number="9">God, confuse them until they quarrel with themselves. Destroy them with their own violent strife and slander. They have divided the city with their discord.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Though they patrol the walls night and day against invaders, the real danger is within the city— the misery and strife in the hearts of its people.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Murder is in their midst. Wherever you turn, you find trouble and ruin.</verse>
				<verse number="12">It wasn’t an enemy who taunted me. If it was my enemy, filled with pride and hatred, then I could have endured it. I would have just run away.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But it was you, my intimate friend—one like a brother to me. It was you, my adviser, the companion I walked with and worked with!</verse>
				<verse number="14">We once had sweet fellowship with each other. We worshiped in unity as one, celebrating together with God’s people.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Now desolation and darkness has come upon you. May you and all those like you descend into the pit of destruction! Since evil has been your home, may evil now bury you alive!</verse>
				<verse number="16">But as for me, I will call upon the Lord to save me, and I know he will!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Every evening I will explain my need to him. Every morning I will move my soul toward him. Every waking hour I will worship only him, and he will hear and respond to my cry.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Though many wish to fight and the tide of battle turns against me, by your power I will be safe and secure; peace will be my portion.</verse>
				<verse number="19">God himself will hear me! God-Enthroned through everlasting ages, the God of unchanging faithfulness— he will put them in their place, all those who refuse to love and revere him!</verse>
				<verse number="20">I was betrayed by my friend, though I lived in peace with him. While he was stretching out his hand of friendship, he was secretly breaking every promise he had ever made to me!</verse>
				<verse number="21">His words were smooth and charming. Yet his heart was disloyal and full of hatred— his words soft as silk while all the time scheming my demise.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So here’s what I’ve learned through it all: Leave all your cares and anxieties at the feet of the Lord, and measureless grace will strengthen you.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He will watch over his devoted lovers, never letting them slip or be overthrown. He will send all my enemies to the pit of destruction. Murderers, liars, and betrayers will face an untimely death. My life’s hope and trust is in you, and you’ll never fail to rescue me!</verse>

				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">Moab will become my lowly servant. Edom will likewise serve my purposes. I will lift up a shout of victory over the land of Philistia!</verse>
				<verse number="9">But who will bring my triumph into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom’s fortresses?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Have you really rejected us, refusing to fight our battles?</verse>
				<verse number="11">Give us a father’s help when we face our enemies. For to trust in any man is an empty hope.</verse>
				<verse number="12">With God’s help we will fight like heroes, and he will trample down our every foe!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="61">
				<verse number="1">O God, hear my prayer. Listen to my heart’s cry.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For no matter where I am, even when I’m far from home, I will cry out to you for a father’s help. When I’m feeble and overwhelmed by life, guide me into your glory, where I am safe and sheltered.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Lord, you are a paradise of protection to me. You lift me high above the fray. None of my foes can touch me when I’m held firmly in your wraparound presence!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Keep me in this glory. Let me live continually under your splendor-shadow, hiding my life in you forever.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You have heard my sweet resolutions to love and serve you, for I am your beloved. And you have given me an inheritance of rich treasures, which you give to all your devoted lovers.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You treat me like a king, giving me a full and abundant life, years and years of reigning, like many generations rolled into one.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will live enthroned with you forever! Guard me, God, with your unending, unfailing love. Let me live my days walking in grace and truth before you.</verse>

			<chapter number="62">
				<verse number="1">I stand silently to listen for the one I love, waiting as long as it takes for the Lord to rescue me. For God alone has become my Savior.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He alone is my safe place; his wraparound presence always protects me. For he is my champion defender; there’s no risk of failure with God. So why would I let worry paralyze me, even when troubles multiply around me?</verse>
				<verse number="3">But look at these who want me dead, shouting their vicious threats at me! The moment they discover my weakness, they all begin plotting to take me down.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Liars, hypocrites, with nothing good to say— all their energies are spent on moving me from this exalted place.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I am standing in absolute stillness, silent before the one I love, waiting as long as it takes for him to rescue me. Only God is my Savior, and he will not fail me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For he alone is my safe place. His wraparound presence always protects me as my champion defender. There’s no risk of failure with God! So why would I let worry paralyze me, even when troubles multiply around me?</verse>
				<verse number="7">God’s glory is all around me! His wraparound presence is all I need, for the Lord is my Savior, my hero, and my life-giving strength.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Trust only in God every moment! Tell him all your troubles and pour out your heart-longings to him. Believe me when I tell you—he will help you!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Before God all the people of the earth, high or low, are like smoke that disappears, like a vapor that quickly vanishes away. Compared to God they’re nothing but vanity, nothing at all!</verse>
				<verse number="10">The wealth of the world is nothing to God. So if your wealth increases, don’t be boastful or put your trust in your money. And don’t you think for a moment that you can get away with stealing by overcharging others just to get more for yourself!</verse>
				<verse number="11">God said to me once and for all, “All the strength and power you need flows from me!” And again I heard it clearly said,</verse>
				<verse number="12">“All the love you need is found in me!” And it’s true that you repay people for what they do.</verse>

			<chapter number="63">
				<verse number="1">O God of my life, I’m lovesick for you in this weary wilderness. I thirst with the deepest longings to love you more, with cravings in my heart that can’t be described. Such yearning grips my soul for you, my God!</verse>
				<verse number="2">I’m energized every time I enter your heavenly sanctuary to seek more of your power and drink in more of your glory.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For your tender mercies mean more to me than life itself. How I love and praise you, God!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Daily I will worship you passionately and with all my heart. My arms will wave to you like banners of praise.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I overflow with praise when I come before you, for the anointing of your presence satisfies me like nothing else. You are such a rich banquet of pleasure to my soul.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I lie awake each night thinking of you and reflecting on how you help me like a father. I sing through the night under your splendor-shadow, offering up to you my songs of delight and joy!</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">With passion I pursue and cling to you. Because I feel your grip on my life, I keep my soul close to your heart.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Those who plot to destroy me shall descend into the darkness of hell.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They will be consumed by their own evil and become nothing more than dust under our feet.</verse>
				<verse number="11">These liars will be silenced forever! But with the anointing of a king I will dance and rejoice along with all his devoted lovers who trust in him.</verse>

			<chapter number="64">
				<verse number="1">Lord, can’t you hear my cry, my bitter complaint? Keep me safe from this band of criminals and from the conspiracy of these wicked men. They gather in their secret counsel to destroy me.</verse>

				<verse number="3">Can’t you hear their slander, their lies? Their words are like poison-tipped arrows shot from the shadows. They are unafraid and have no fear of consequences.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">They persist with their evil plans and plot together to hide their traps. They boast, “No one can see us or stop us!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">They search out opportunities to pervert justice as they plan the “perfect crime.” How unsearchable is their endless evil! They try desperately to hide the deep darkness of their hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But all the while God has his own fire-tipped arrows! Suddenly, without warning, they will be pierced and struck down.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Staggering backward, they will be destroyed by the very ones they spoke against. All who see this will view them with scorn.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then all will stand awestruck over what God has done, seeing how he vindicated the victims of these crimes.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The lovers of God will be glad, rejoicing in the Lord. They will be found in his glorious wraparound presence, singing songs of praise to God!</verse>

				<verse number="10">Every field is watered with the abundance of rain— showers soaking the earth and softening its clods, causing seeds to sprout throughout the land.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You crown the earth with the fruits of your goodness. Wherever you go, the tracks of your chariot wheels drip with oil.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Luxuriant green pastures boast of your bounty as you make every hillside blossom with joy.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The grazing meadows are covered with flocks, and the fertile valleys are clothed with grain, each one dancing and shouting for joy, creation’s celebration! They’re all singing their songs of praise to you!</verse>

				<verse number="5">Everyone will say, “Come and see the incredible things God has done; it will take your breath away! He multiplies miracles for his people!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">He made a highway going right through the Red Sea as the Hebrews passed through on dry ground, exploding with joyous excitement over the miracles of God.</verse>
				<verse number="7">In his great and mighty power he rules forever, watching over every movement of every nation. So beware, rebel lands; he knows how to humble you!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Praise God, all you peoples. Praise him everywhere and let everyone know you love him!</verse>
				<verse number="9">There’s no doubt about it: God holds our lives safely in his hands. He’s the one who keeps us faithfully following him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">O Lord, we have passed through your fire; like precious metal made pure, you’ve proved us, perfected us, and made us holy.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You’ve captured us, ensnared us in your net. Then, like prisoners, you placed chains around our necks.</verse>
				<verse number="12">You’ve allowed our enemies to prevail against us. We’ve passed through fire and flood, yet in the end you always bring us out better than we were before, saturated with your goodness.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I come before your presence with my sacrifice. I’ll give you all that I’ve promised, everything I have.</verse>

				<verse number="19">But praises rise to God, for he paid attention to my prayer and answered my cry to him!</verse>
				<verse number="20">I will forever praise this God who didn’t close his heart when I prayed and never said no when I asked him for help. He never once refused to show me his tender love.</verse>

				<verse number="5">To the fatherless he is a father. To the widow he is a champion friend. The lonely he makes part of a family. The prisoners he leads into prosperity until they sing for joy. This is our Holy God in his Holy Place! But for the rebels there is heartache and despair.</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">O Lord, it was you who marched in front of your people, leading them through the wasteland.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The earth shook beneath your feet; the heavens filled with clouds before the presence of the God of Sinai. The sacred mountain shook at the sight of the face of Israel’s God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You, O God, sent the reviving rain upon your weary inheritance, showers of blessing to refresh it.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So there your people settled. And in your kindness you provided the poor with abundance.</verse>
				<verse number="11">God Almighty declares the word of the gospel with power, and the warring women of Zion deliver its message:</verse>
				<verse number="12">“The conquering legions have themselves been conquered. Look at them flee!” Now Zion’s women are left to gather the spoils.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When you sleep between sharpened stakes, I see you sparkling like silver and glistening like gold, covered by the beautiful wings of a dove!</verse>
				<verse number="14">When the Almighty found a king for himself, it became white as snow in his shade.</verse>
				<verse number="15">O huge, magnificent mountain, you are the mighty kingdom of God! All the other peaks, though impressive and imposing, look with envy on you, Mount Zion! For Zion is the mountain where God has chosen to live forever.</verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">Look! The mighty chariots of God! Ten thousands upon ten thousands, more than anyone could ever number. God is at the front, leading them all from Mount Sinai into his sanctuary with the radiance of holiness upon him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He ascends into the heavenly heights, taking his many captured ones with him, leading them in triumphal procession. And gifts were given to men, even the once rebellious, so that they may dwell with Yah.</verse>
				<verse number="19">What a glorious God! He gives us salvation over and over, then daily he carries our burdens!</verse>
				<verse number="20">Our God is a mighty God who saves us over and over! For the Lord, Yahweh, rescues us from the ways of death many times.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But he will crush every enemy, shattering their strength. He will make heads roll for they refuse to repent of their stubborn, sinful ways.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I hear the Lord God saying to all the enemies of his people, “You’d better come out of your hiding places, all of you who are doing your best to stay far away from me. Don’t you know there’s no place to hide?</verse>
				<verse number="23">For my people will be the conquerors; they will soon have you under their feet. They will crush you until there is nothing left!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">O God, my King, your triumphal processions keep moving onward in holiness; you’re moving onward toward the Holy Place!</verse>
				<verse number="25">Leaders in front, then musicians, with young maidens in between, striking their tambourines.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And they sing, “Let all God’s princely people rejoice! Let all the congregations bring their blessing to God, saying, ‘The Lord of the fountain! The Lord of the fountain of life! The Lord of the fountain of Israel!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Astonishingly, it’s the favored youth leading the way: princes of praise in their royal robes and exalted princes are among them, along with princes who have wrestled with God.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Display your strength, God, and we’ll be strong! For your miracles have made us who we are. Lord, do it again and parade from your temple your mighty power. By your command even kings will bring gifts to you.</verse>
				<verse number="29"></verse>
				<verse number="30">God, rebuke the beast-life that hides within us! Rebuke those who claim to be “strong ones,” who lurk within the congregation and abuse the people out of their love for money. God scatters the people who are spoiling for a fight.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Africa will send her noble envoys to you, O God. They will come running, stretching out their hands in love to you.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Let all the nations of the earth sing songs of praise to Almighty God! Go ahead, all you nations—sing your praise to the Lord!</verse>
				<verse number="33">Make music for the one who strides the ancient skies. Listen to his thunderous voice of might split open the heavens.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Give it up for God, for he alone has all the strength and power! Proclaim his majesty! For his glory shines down on Israel. His mighty strength soars in the clouds of glory.</verse>
				<verse number="35">God, we are consumed with awe, trembling before you as your glory streams from your Holy Place. The God of power shares his mighty strength with Israel and with all his people. God, we give our highest praise to you!</verse>

				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">I’m weary, exhausted with weeping. My throat is dry, my voice is gone, my eyes are swollen with sorrow, and I’m waiting for you, God, to come through for me.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I can’t even count all those who hate me for no reason. Many influential men want me silenced, yet I’ve done nothing against them. Must I restore what I never took away?</verse>
				<verse number="5">God, my life is an open book to you. You know every sin I’ve ever done. For nothing within me is hidden from your sight!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Lord Yahweh of Angel Armies, keep me from ever being a stumbling block to others, to those who love you. Lord God of Israel, don’t let what happens to me be the source of confusion to those who are passionate for you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Because of my love for you, Lord, I have been mocked, cursed, and disgraced.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Even my own brothers, those of my family, act as though they don’t want anything to do with me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">My love for you has my heart on fire! My passion for your house consumes me! Nothing will turn me away, even though I endure all the insults of those who insult you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">When they see me seeking for more of you with weeping and fasting, they all just scoff and scorn at my passion.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When I humble myself with sorrow over my sin, it gives them a reason to mock me even more.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The leaders, the influential ones—how they scorn my passion for you! I’ve become the talk of the town, the theme of drunkards’ songs.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But I keep calling out to you, Yahweh! I know you will bend down to listen to me, for now is the season of favor. Because of your faithful love for me, your answer to my prayer will be my sure salvation.</verse>

				<verse number="16">Oh, Lord God, answer my prayers! I need to see your tender kindness, your grace, your compassion, and your constant love. Just let me see your face, and turn your heart toward me. Come running quickly to your servant. In this deep distress, come and answer my prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="17"></verse>
				<verse number="18">Come closer as a friend and redeem me. Set me free so my enemies cannot say that you are powerless.</verse>
				<verse number="19">See how they dishonor me in shame and disgrace? You know, Lord, what I’m going through, and you see it all.</verse>
				<verse number="20">I’m heartsick and heartbroken by it all. Their contempt has crushed my soul. I looked for sympathy and compassion but found only empty stares.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I was hungry and they gave me bitter food. I was thirsty and they offered me vinegar.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Let their “feasts” turn to ashes. Let their “peace and security” become their downfall.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Make them blind as bats, groping in the dark. Let them be feeble, trembling continually.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Pour out your fury on them all! Consume them with the fire of your anger! Burn down the walled palace where they live! Leave them homeless and desolate!</verse>
				<verse number="25"></verse>
				<verse number="26">For they come against the one you yourself have struck, and they scorn the pain of those you’ve pierced.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Pile on them the guilt of their sins. Don’t let them ever go free.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Leave them out of your list of the living! Blot them out of your Book of Life! Never name them as your own!</verse>
				<verse number="29">I am burdened and broken by this pain. When your miracle rescue comes to me, it will lift me to the highest place.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then my song will be a burst of praise to you. My glory-shouts will make your fame even more glorious to all who hear my praises!</verse>
				<verse number="31">For I know, Yahweh, that my praises mean more to you than all my gifts and sacrifices.</verse>
				<verse number="32">All who seek you will see God do this for them, and they’ll overflow with gladness. Let this revive your hearts, all you lovers of God!</verse>
				<verse number="33">For Yahweh does listen to the poor and needy and will not abandon his prisoners of love.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Let all the universe praise him! The high heavens and everyone on earth, praise him! Let the oceans deep, with everything in them, keep it up!</verse>
				<verse number="35">God will come to save his Zion-people. God will build up his cities of Judah, for there his people will live in peace.</verse>

				<verse number="14">They will be rescued from tyranny and torture, for their lifeblood is precious in his eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Long live this King! May the wealth of the world be laid before him. May there be ceaseless praise and prayer to him. May all the blessing be brought to him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Bless us with a bountiful harvest, with golden grain swaying on the mountain fields! May the cities be full of praising people, fruitful and filled—</verse>

				<verse number="18">Praise Yahweh forever, the God of Israel! He is the one and only God of wonders, surpassing every expectation.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The blazing glory of his name will be praised forever! May all the earth overflow with his glory! Faithful is our King! Amen!</verse>

			<chapter number="73">
				<verse number="1">No one can deny it—God is really good to Israel and to all those with pure hearts. But I nearly missed seeing it for myself.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Here’s my story: I narrowly missed losing it all.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I was stumbling over what I saw the wicked doing. For when I saw the boasters with such wealth and prosperity, I became jealous over their smug security.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Indulging in whatever they wanted, going where they wanted, doing what they wanted, and with no care in the world, no pain, no problems—they seemed to have it made. They lived as though life would never end.</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6">They didn’t even try to hide their pride and opulence. Cruelty and violence are parts of their lifestyle.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Pampered and pompous, vice oozes from their souls; they overflow with vanity.</verse>
				<verse number="8">They’re such snobs—looking down their noses. They even scoff at God! They are nothing but bullies threatening God’s people.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They are loudmouths with no fear of God, pretending to know it all— windbags full of hot air, impressing only themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yet the people keep coming back to listen to more of their nonsense.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They tell their cohorts, “God will never know. See, he has no clue of what we’re doing.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">These are the wicked ones I’m talking about! They never have to lift a finger, living a life of ease while their riches multiply.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Have I been foolish to play by the rules and keep my life pure?</verse>
				<verse number="14">Here I am suffering under your discipline day after day. I feel like I’m being punished all day long.</verse>
				<verse number="15">If I had given in to my pain and spoken of what I was really feeling, it would have sounded like unfaithfulness to the next generation.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When I tried to understand it all, I just couldn’t. It was too puzzling—too much of a riddle to me.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But then one day I was brought into the sanctuaries of God, and in the light of glory, my distorted perspective vanished. Then I understood that the destiny of the wicked was near!</verse>
				<verse number="18">They’re the ones who are on the slippery path, and God will suddenly let them slide off into destruction to be consumed with terrors forever!</verse>
				<verse number="19">It will be an instant end to all their life of ease; a blink of the eye and they’re swept away by sudden calamity! They’re all nothing more than momentary monarchs—</verse>
				<verse number="20">soon to disappear like a dream when one awakes. When the rooster crows, Lord God, you’ll despise their life of fantasies.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When I saw all of this, what turmoil filled my heart, piercing my opinions with your truth.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I was so stupid. I was senseless and ignorant, acting like a brute beast before you, Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Yet, in spite of all this, I still belong to you; you hold me by my right hand.</verse>
				<verse number="24">You lead me with your secret wisdom. And following you brings me into your brightness and glory!</verse>
				<verse number="25">Whom have I in heaven but you? You’re all I want! No one on earth means as much to me as you.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Lord, so many times I fail; I fall into disgrace. But when I trust in you, I have a strong and glorious presence protecting and anointing me. Forever you’re all I need!</verse>
				<verse number="27">Those who abandon the worship of God will perish. The false and unfaithful will be silenced, never heard from again.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But I’ll keep coming closer and closer to you, Lord Yahweh, for your name is good to me. I’ll keep telling the world of your awesome works, my faithful and glorious God!</verse>

				<verse number="1">Are you really going to leave us, God? Would you turn your back on us, rejecting your people? We are yours, your very own. Will your anger smolder against us forever?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Don’t forget that we are your beloved ones. Wrap us back into your heart again, for you chose us. You brought us out of our slavery and bondage and made us your favored ones, your Zion-people, your home on earth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Turn your steps toward this devastation. Come running to bring your restoring grace to these ruins, to what the enemy has done to devastate your Holy Place.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They have come into the very midst of your dwelling place, roaring like beasts, setting up their banners to flaunt their conquest.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now everything is in shambles! They’ve totally destroyed it. Like a forest chopped down to the ground, there’s nothing left.</verse>
				<verse number="6">All of the beauty of the craftsmanship of the inner place has been ruined, smashed, broken, and shattered.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They’ve burned it all to the ground. They’ve violated your sanctuary, the very dwelling place of your glory and your name.</verse>
				<verse number="8">They boasted, “Let’s completely crush them! Let’s wipe out every trace of this God. Let’s burn up every sacred place where they worship this God.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">We don’t see any miraculous signs anymore. There’s no longer a prophet among us who can tell us how long this devastation will continue.</verse>
				<verse number="10">God, how much longer will you let this go on and allow these barbarians to blaspheme your name? Will you stand back and watch them get away with this forever?</verse>
				<verse number="11">Why don’t you do something? You have the power to break in, so why would you hide your great power from us? Don’t hold back! Unleash your might and give them a final blow.</verse>
				<verse number="12">You have always been, and always will be, my King. You are the mighty conqueror, working wonders all over the world.</verse>
				<verse number="13">It was you who split the sea in two by your glorious strength. You smashed the power of Tannin, the sea monster.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You crushed the might of Leviathan, the great dragon, then you took the crumbs and fed them to the sharks.</verse>
				<verse number="15">With your glory you opened up springs and fountains, then you spoke, and the ever-flowing springs of Jordan dried up so we could cross over.</verse>
				<verse number="16">You own the day and the night. Sunlight and starlight call you Creator.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The four corners of the earth were formed by your hands, and every changing season owes its beauty to you.</verse>
				<verse number="18">O  Yahweh, don’t ever forget how these arrogant enemies, like fools, have mocked your name.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Lord, aren’t we your beloved dove that praises you? Protect us from these wild beasts who want to harm us. Don’t leave us as lambs among wolves! You can’t abandon us after all we’ve been through!</verse>
				<verse number="20">Remember your promises to us, for darkness covers the land, giving the violent ones a hiding place.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Don’t let these insults continue. Can’t you see that we are your downtrodden and oppressed people? Make the poor and needy into a choir of praise to you!</verse>
				<verse number="22">Don’t ignore these ignorant words, this continual mocking. Rise up, God; it’s time to defend yourself from all this.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Never forget what your adversaries are saying. For their rage and uproar rise continually against you. It’s time to stand up to them!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="75">
				<verse number="1">God, our hearts spill over with praise to you! We overflow with thanks, for your name is the “Near One.” All we want to talk about is your wonderful works! And we hear your reply:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“When the time is ripe I will arise, and I will judge the world with perfect righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Though I have set the earth firmly on its pillars, I will shake it until it totters, and everyone’s hearts will tremble.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">God warns the proud, “Stop your arrogant boasting!” And he warns the wicked, “Don’t think for a moment you can resist me!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Why would you speak with such stubborn pride? Don’t you dare raise your fist against me!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">This I know: the favor that brings promotion and power doesn’t come from anywhere on earth, for no one exalts a person but God, the true judge of all. He alone determines where favor rests. He anoints one for greatness and brings another down to his knees.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">A foaming cup filled with judgment mixed with fury is in the hands of the Lord Yahweh, full to the brim and ready to run over. He filled it up for the wicked, and they will drink it down to the very last drop!</verse>
				<verse number="9">But I will proclaim the victory of the God of Jacob. My melodies of praise will make him known.</verse>
				<verse number="10">My praises will break the powers of wickedness, while the righteous will be promoted and become powerful!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="76">
				<verse number="1">God is well known in the land of Judah. He is famous throughout Israel,</verse>
				<verse number="2">making his home in Jerusalem, living here on Mount Zion.</verse>
				<verse number="3">That’s where he smashes every weapon of war that comes against him. That’s where he uses the broken arrows as kindling for his mighty bonfire.</verse>
				<verse number="4">God, you are so resplendent and radiant! Your majesty shines from your everlasting mountain. Nothing could be compared to you in glory!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Even the mightiest of men have been paralyzed by your presence. They were so stunned and lifeless, not even the strongest one could lift a hand.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When Jacob’s God roared his rebuke, soldiers and their steeds all fell to the ground, stunned and lying still.</verse>
				<verse number="7">No wonder you are greatly feared! You are the awe-inspiring God! For who could ever stand before your face when your fierce anger burns and live to tell about it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">As the earth itself holds its breath in awe before you, judgment is decreed from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You arise to punish evil and defend the gentle upon the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You have power to transform man’s futile anger into praise. The fury of your enemies only causes your fame to increase.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So you’d better keep every promise you’ve ever made to the Awesome One, Yahweh! Let all people bring their extravagant gifts to him alone.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He is famous for breaking the spirit of the powers that be. And the kings of the earth will know him as the Fearsome One!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="77">
				<verse number="1">I poured out my complaint to you, God. I lifted up my voice, shouting out for your help.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When I was in deep distress, in my day of trouble, I reached out for you with hands stretched out to heaven. Over and over I kept looking for you, God, but your comforting grace was nowhere to be found.</verse>
				<verse number="3">As I thought of you I moaned, “God, where are you?” I’m overwhelmed with despair as I wait for your help to arrive.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I can’t get a wink of sleep until you come and comfort me. Now I’m too burdened to even pray!</verse>
				<verse number="5">My mind wandered, thinking of days gone by— the years long since passed.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then I remembered the worship songs I used to sing in the night seasons, and my heart began to fill again with thoughts of you. So my spirit went out once more in search of you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Would you really walk off and leave me forever, my Lord God? Won’t you show me your kind favor, delighting in me again?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Has your well of sweet mercy dried up? Will your promises never come true?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Have you somehow forgotten to show me love? Are you so angry that you’ve closed your heart of compassion toward me?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Lord, what wounds me most is that it’s somehow my fault that you’ve changed your heart toward me and I no longer see the years of the Mighty One or your right hand of power.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yet I could never forget all your miracles, my God, as I remember all your wonders of old.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I ponder all you’ve done, Lord, musing on all your miracles.</verse>
				<verse number="13">It’s here in your presence, in your sanctuary, where I learn more of your ways, for holiness is revealed in everything you do. Lord, you’re the one and only, the great and glorious God!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Your display of wonders, miracles, and power makes the nations acknowledge you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">By your glory-bursts you’ve rescued us over and over. Just ask the sons of Jacob or the sons of Joseph, and they will tell you! And all of us, your beloved ones, know that it’s true!</verse>
				<verse number="16">When the many waters of the Red Sea took one look at you, they were afraid and ran away to hide— trembling to its depths!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Storm clouds filled with water high in the skies; cloudbursts and thunderclaps announced your approach. Lightning-flashes lit up the landscape.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Rolling whirlwinds exploded with sonic booms of thunder, rumbling as the skies shouted out your story with light and sound and wind. Everything on earth shook and trembled as you drew near.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Your steps formed a highway through the seas with footprints on a pathway no one even knew was there.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You led your people forward by your loving hand, blessed by the leadership of Moses and Aaron.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="78">
				<verse number="1">Beloved ones, listen to this instruction. Open your heart to the revelation of this mystery that I share with you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">A parable and a proverb are hidden in what I say— an intriguing riddle from the past.</verse>
				<verse number="3">We’ve heard true stories from our fathers about our rich heritage. We will continue to tell our children and not hide from the rising generation the great marvels of our God— his miracles and power that have brought us all this far.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">The story of Israel is a lesson in God’s ways. He established decrees for Jacob and established the law in Israel, and he commanded our forefathers to teach them to their children.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For perpetuity God’s ways will be passed down from one generation to the next, even to those not yet born.</verse>
				<verse number="7">In this way, every generation will set its hope in God and not forget his wonderful works but keep his commandments.</verse>
				<verse number="8">By following his ways they will break the past bondage of their fickle fathers, who were a stubborn, rebellious generation and whose spirits strayed from the eternal God. They refused to love him with all their hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Take, for example, the sons of Ephraim. Though they were all equipped warriors, each with weapons, when the battle began they retreated and ran away in fear.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They didn’t really believe the promises of God; they refused to trust him and move forward in faith.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They forgot his wonderful works and the miracles of the past,</verse>
				<verse number="12">even their exodus from Egypt, the epic miracle of his might. They forgot the glories of his power at the place of passing over.</verse>
				<verse number="13">God split the sea wide open, and the waters stood at attention on either side as the people passed on through!</verse>
				<verse number="14">By day the moving glory-cloud led them forward. And all through the night the fire-cloud stood as a sentry of light.</verse>
				<verse number="15">In the days of desert dryness, he split open the mighty rock, and the waters flowed like a river before their very eyes. He gave them all they wanted to drink from his living springs.</verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">Yet they kept their rebellion alive against God Most High, and their sins against God continued to be counted.</verse>
				<verse number="18">In their hearts they tested God just to get what they wanted, asking for the food their hearts craved.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Like spoiled children they grumbled against God, demanding he prove his love by saying, “Can’t God provide for us in this barren wilderness? Will he give us food, or will he only give us water? Where’s our meal?”</verse>
				<verse number="20"></verse>
				<verse number="21">Then God heard all their complaining and was furious! His anger flared up against his people.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For they turned away from faith and walked away in fear; they failed to trust in his power to save them when he was near.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Still he spoke on their behalf, and the skies opened up; the windows of heaven poured out food, the mercy bread-manna. The grain of grace fell from the clouds.</verse>
				<verse number="24"></verse>
				<verse number="25">Humans ate angels’ food—the meal of the mighty ones. His grace gave them more than enough!</verse>
				<verse number="26">The heavenly winds of miracle power blew in their favor, and food rained down upon them; succulent quail quieted their hunger as they ate all they wanted.</verse>
				<verse number="27"></verse>
				<verse number="28">Food fell from the skies, thick as clouds; their provision floated down right in front of their eyes!</verse>
				<verse number="29">He gave them all they desired, and they ate to their fill.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But before they had even finished, even with their food still in their mouths, God’s fiery anger arose against them, killing the finest of their mighty men.</verse>
				<verse number="31"></verse>
				<verse number="32">Yet in spite of all this, they kept right on sinning. Even when they saw God’s marvels, they refused to believe God could care for them.</verse>
				<verse number="33">So God cut their lives short with sudden disaster, with nothing to show for their lives but fear and failure.</verse>
				<verse number="34">When he cared for them they ignored him, but when he began to kill them, ending their lives in a moment, they came running back to God, pleading for mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="35">They remembered that God, the Mighty One, was their strong protector, the Hero-God who would come to their rescue.</verse>
				<verse number="36">But their repentance lasted only as long as they were in danger; they lied through their teeth to the true God of the Covenant. So quickly they wandered away from his promises, following God with their words and not their hearts! Their worship was only flattery.</verse>
				<verse number="37"></verse>
				<verse number="38">But amazingly, God—so full of compassion—still forgave them. He covered over their sins with his love, refusing to destroy them all. Over and over he held back his anger, restraining wrath to show them mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="39">He knew that they were made from mere dust— frail, fragile, and short-lived, here today and gone tomorrow.</verse>
				<verse number="40">How many times they rebelled in their desert days! How they grieved him with their grumblings.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Again and again they limited God, preventing him from blessing them. Continually they turned back from him and provoked the Holy One of Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="42">They forgot his great love, how he took them by his hand, and with redemption’s kiss he delivered them from their enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="43">They disregarded all the epic signs and marvels they saw when they escaped from Egypt’s bondage. They forgot the judgment of the plagues that set them free.</verse>
				<verse number="44">God turned their rivers into blood, leaving the people thirsty.</verse>
				<verse number="45">He sent them vast swarms of filthy flies that sucked their blood. He sent hordes of frogs, ruining their lives.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Grasshoppers consumed all their crops.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Every garden and every orchard was flattened with blasts of hailstones, their fruit trees ruined by a killing frost.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Even their cattle fell prey, pounded by the falling hail; their livestock were struck with bolts of lightning.</verse>
				<verse number="49">Finally, he unleashed upon them the fierceness of his anger. Such fury! He sent them sorrow and devastating trouble by his mighty band of destroying angels; messengers of death were dispatched against them.</verse>
				<verse number="50">He lifted his mercy and let loose his fearful anger and did not spare their lives. He released the judgment-plagues to rage through their land. God struck down in death all the firstborn sons of Egypt— the pride and joy of each family.</verse>
				<verse number="51"></verse>
				<verse number="52">Then, like a shepherd leading his sheep, God led his people out of tyranny, guiding them through the wilderness like a flock.</verse>
				<verse number="53">Safely and carefully God led them out, with nothing to fear. But their enemies he led into the sea. He took care of them there once and for all!</verse>
				<verse number="54">Eventually God brought his people to the Holy Land, to a land of hills that he had prepared for them.</verse>
				<verse number="55">He drove out and scattered all the peoples occupying the land, staking out an inheritance, a portion for each of Israel’s tribes.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Yet for all of this, they still rebelled and refused to follow his ways, provoking to anger the God Most High.</verse>
				<verse number="57">Like traitors turning back, they forsook him. They were even worse than their fathers! They became treacherous deceivers, crooked and corrupt, and worshiped false gods in the high places, bringing low the name of God with every idol they erected. No wonder he was filled with jealousy and furious with anger!</verse>
				<verse number="58"></verse>
				<verse number="59">Enraged with anger, God turned his wrath on them, and he rejected his people with disgust.</verse>
				<verse number="60">God walked away from them and left his dwelling place at Shiloh, abandoning the place where he had lived among them,</verse>
				<verse number="61">allowing his emblem of strength, his glory-ark, to be captured. Enemies stole the very source of Israel’s power.</verse>
				<verse number="62">God vented his rage, allowing his people to be butchered when they went out to battle, for his anger was intense against his very own.</verse>
				<verse number="63">Their young men fell on the battlefield and never came back. Their daughters never heard their wedding songs, since there was no one left to marry!</verse>
				<verse number="64">Their priests were slaughtered and their widows were killed before they had time to weep.</verse>
				<verse number="65">Then all at once the Almighty awakened as though he had been asleep. Like a mighty man he arose, roaring into action!</verse>
				<verse number="66">He blasted into battle, driving back every foe, defeating them and disgracing them for time and eternity.</verse>
				<verse number="67">He rejected Joseph’s family, the tribe of Ephraim.</verse>
				<verse number="68">He chose instead the tribe of Judah and Mount Zion, which he loves.</verse>
				<verse number="69">There he built his towering temple, strong and enduring as the earth itself.</verse>
				<verse number="70">God also chose his beloved one, David. He promoted him from caring for sheep and made him his prophetic servant.</verse>
				<verse number="71">God prepared David and took this gentle shepherd-king and presented him before the people as the one who would love and care for them with integrity, a pure heart, and the anointing to lead Israel, his holy inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="72"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="79">
				<verse number="1">God, won’t you do something? Barbarians have invaded your inheritance. Your temple of holiness has been violated, and Jerusalem has been left in ruins.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The corpses of your loving people are lying in the open— food for the beasts and the birds.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The shed blood of your servants has soaked the city, with no one left to bury the dead.</verse>

				<verse number="7">See how they’ve attacked us, consuming the land, leaving it desolate.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Please, God, don’t hold the sins of our fathers against us. Don’t make us pay for their sins. Hurry to our side, and let your tenderhearted mercy meet us in our need, for we are devastated beyond belief.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Our hero, come and rescue us! O God of the breakthrough, for the glory of your name, come and help us! Forgive and restore us; heal us and cover us in your love.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Why should all the nations sneer at us, saying, “Where is this God of yours?” Now is the time, Lord. Show your people and all the world that you will avenge this slaughter and bloodshed once and for all!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Listen, Lord! Hear the sighing of all the prisoners of war, all those doomed to die. Demonstrate your glory-power, and come and rescue your condemned children!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Lord God, take what these mocking masses have done to us and pay it all back to them seven times over.</verse>

				<verse number="10">Because of your favor on your vineyard, blessing extended to every mountain of influence. Through this flourishing vineyard mighty ones were raised up.

				<verse number="5">He has given these feasts to remind us of his triumph over Egypt, when he went out to wage war against them. I heard the message in an unknown tongue as he said to me,</verse>
				<verse number="6">“I have removed your backbreaking burdens and have freed your hands from the hard labor and toil.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You called out to me in your time of trouble, and I rescued you. I came down from the realm of the secret place of thunder, where mysteries hide. I came down to save you. I tested your hearts at the place where there was no water to drink, the place of your bitter argument with me.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Listen to me, my dear people. For I’m warning you, and you’d better listen well! For I hold something against you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Don’t ever be guilty of worshiping any other god but me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I am your only God, the living God. Wasn’t I the one who broke the strongholds over you and raised you up out of bondage? Open your mouth with a mighty decree; I will fulfill it now, you’ll see! The words that you speak, so shall it be!</verse>
				<verse number="11">But my people still wouldn’t listen; my princely people would not yield to me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So I lifted my grace from off of their lives, and I surrendered them to the stubbornness of their hearts. For they were living according to their own selfish fantasies.</verse>
				<verse number="13">O that my people would once and for all listen to me and walk faithfully in my footsteps, following my ways.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then and only then will I conquer your every foe and tell every one of them, ‘You must go!’</verse>
				<verse number="15">Those who hate my ways will cringe before me and their punishment will be eternal.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But I will feed you with my spiritual bread. You will feast and be satisfied with me, feeding on my revelation-truth like honey dripping from the cliffs of the high place.”</verse>

			<chapter number="82">
				<verse number="1">All rise! For God now comes to judge as he convenes heaven’s courtroom. He judges every judge and rules in the midst of the gods, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“How long will you judges refuse to listen to the voice of true justice and continue to corrupt what is right by judging in favor of the wrong?”</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Defend the defenseless, the fatherless and the forgotten, the disenfranchised and the destitute.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Your duty is to deliver the poor and the powerless; liberate them from the grasp of the wicked.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But you continue in your darkness and ignorance while the foundations of society are shaken to the core!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Didn’t I commission you as judges, saying, ‘You are all like gods, since you judge on my behalf. You are all like sons of the Most High, my representatives.’</verse>
				<verse number="7">Nevertheless, in death you are nothing but mere men! You will be laid in the ground like any prince and you will die.”</verse>

In their defiant arrogance they rise up to host their secret council against your people. They conspire together to come and harm your cherished ones—your hidden ones.</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">Our enemies keep saying, “Now is the time to wipe Israel off the map. We’ll destroy even the memory of her existence!”</verse>

				<verse number="6">All the sons of Ishmael, the desert sheiks and the nomadic tribes, Amalekites, Canaanites, Moabites, and all the nations that surround us, Philistines, Phoenicians, Gadarenes, and Samaritans; allied together they’re ready to attack!</verse>

				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">Do to them all what you did to the Midianites who were defeated by Gideon. Or what you did to Sisera and Jabin when Deborah and Barak defeated them by the Kishon River.</verse>

				<verse number="11">Repeat history, God! Make all their “noble ones” die like Oreb, Zebah, and Zalmunna, who said in their pride, “We will seize God’s people along with all their pleasant lands!”</verse>

				<verse number="13">Blow them away, God, like straw in the wind, like a tumbleweed in the wilderness!</verse>

				<verse number="15">Chase them away like before a mighty storm and terrifying tempest.</verse>
				<verse number="16">O Lord, disgrace them until their faces fill with shame, and make them acknowledge the glory of your name.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Make them utter failures in everything they do until they perish in total disgrace and humiliation,</verse>

				<verse number="4">I have made my oath that there will be sons of David forever, sons that are kings through every generation.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Can you hear it? Heaven is filled with your praises, O Lord! All the holy ones are praising you for your miracles. The sons of God are all praising you for your mighty wonders. We could search the skies forever and never find one like you. All the mighty angels could not be compared to you.</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">You are a God who is greatly to be feared as you preside over the council of holy ones. You are surrounded by trembling ones who are overwhelmed with fear and dread, stunned as they stand in awe of you!</verse>
				<verse number="8">So awesome are you, O  Yahweh, Lord God of Angel Armies! Where could we find anyone as glorious as you? Your faithfulness shines all around you!</verse>
				<verse number="9">You rule over oceans and the swelling seas. When their stormy waves rise, you speak, and they lie still.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You crushed the strongholds of Egypt, and all your enemies were scattered at the mighty display of your glory-power.</verse>
				<verse number="11">All the heavens and everything on earth belong to you, for you are the Creator of all that is seen and unseen.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The four corners of the earth were put in place by you. You made the majestic mountains that are still shouting their praises to your name.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Breathtaking and awesome is your power! Astounding and unbelievable is your might and strength when it goes on display!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Your glorious throne rests on a foundation of righteousness and just verdicts. Grace and truth are the attendants who go before you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">O Lord, how blessed are the people who know the triumphant shout, for they walk in the radiance of your presence.</verse>

				<verse number="23">For I will crush his every adversary and do away with all who hate him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Because I love him and treasure him, my faithfulness will always protect him. I will place my great favor upon him, and I will cause his power and fame to increase.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I will set his hand over the sea and his right hand over the rivers.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And he will come before me, saying, ‘You truly are my Father, my only God, and my strong deliverer!’</verse>
				<verse number="27">I am setting him apart, favoring him as my firstborn son. I will make him the most high king in all the earth!</verse>
				<verse number="28">I will love him forever and always show him kindness. My covenant with him will never be broken.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For I have decreed that he will always have an heir— a dynasty that will release the days of heaven on earth.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But if his children turn from me and forsake my words, refusing to walk in my truth, renouncing and violating my laws, then I will surely punish them for their sins with my stern discipline until they regret it.</verse>
				<verse number="31"></verse>
				<verse number="32"></verse>
				<verse number="33">But I will never, no never, lift my faithful love from off their lives. My kindness will prevail and I will never disown them.</verse>

				<verse number="37"></verse>
				<verse number="38">Why have you rejected me, the one you anointed? Why would you cast me away? Why would you lose your temper with me?</verse>
				<verse number="39">You have torn up the contract you made with me, your servant. You have stripped away my crown and thrown it to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="40">You have torn down all my walls of defense and have made my every hiding place into ruins.</verse>
				<verse number="41">All the passersby attack and rob me while my neighbors mock!</verse>
				<verse number="42">Instead of fighting for me, you take the side of my enemies, even giving them strength to subdue me, and then watched them celebrate their victory!</verse>
				<verse number="43">You are no longer helping me in battle. You’ve forsaken me to the swords of those who would strike me down.</verse>
				<verse number="44">You’ve made my regal splendor to decrease and allowed my rule to be overthrown.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Because of you, I’ve become old before my time, and I’m publicly disgraced!</verse>
				<verse number="46">How long will you hide your love from me? Have you left me for good? How long will your anger continue to burn against me?</verse>
				<verse number="47">Remember, Lord, I am nothing but dust, here today and so soon blown away. Is this all you’ve created us for? For nothing but this?</verse>
				<verse number="48">Which one of us will live forever? We are all mortal, terminal, for we will all one day die. Which one of us would ever escape our appointment with death and dodge our own funeral?</verse>
				<verse number="49">So God, where is all this love and kindness you promised us? What happened to your covenant with David?</verse>
				<verse number="50">Have you forgotten how your own servants are being slandered? Lord God, it seems like I’m carrying in my heart all the pain and abuse of many people.</verse>
				<verse number="51">They have relentlessly insulted and persecuted us, your anointed ones.</verse>

				<verse number="1">Look! Yahweh now reigns as King! He has covered himself with majesty and strength, wearing them as his splendor-garments. Regal power surrounds him as he sits securely on his throne. He’s in charge of it all, the entire world, and he knows what he’s doing!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Lord, you have reigned as King from the very beginning of time. Eternity is your home.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Chaos once challenged you. The raging waves lifted themselves over and over, high above the ocean’s depths, letting out their mighty roar! Yet at the sound of your voice they were all stilled by your might. What a majestic King, filled with power!</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">Nothing could ever change your royal decrees; they will last forever! Holiness is the beauty that fills your house; you are the one who abides forevermore!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="94">
				<verse number="1">Lord God Almighty, you are the God who takes vengeance on your enemies. It’s time for you to punish evil! Let your rays of revelation-light shine from your people and pierce the conscience of the wicked and punish them.</verse>
				<verse number="2">It’s time to arise as judge of all the earth; arise to punish the proud with the penalty they deserve!</verse>
				<verse number="3">How much longer will you sit back and watch the wicked triumph in their evil, boasting in all that is wrong?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Listen to them bragging among themselves, big in their own eyes, all because of the crimes they’ve committed against your people! See how they’re crushing those who love you, God, cruelly oppressing those who belong to you.</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6">Heartlessly they murder the widows, the foreigners, and even the orphaned children.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They say to themselves, “The Lord God doesn’t see this. Their God, the God of Jacob, he doesn’t even care!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But you’d better watch out, you stupid fools! You’d better wise up! Why would you act like God doesn’t exist? Do you really think that God can’t hear their cries?</verse>
				<verse number="9">God isn’t hard of hearing; he’ll hear all their cries. God isn’t blind. He who made the eye has superb vision, and he’s watching all you do.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Won’t the God who knows all things know what you’ve done? The God who punishes nations will surely punish you!</verse>
				<verse number="11">The Lord has fully examined every thought of man and found them all to be empty and futile.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Lord Yah, there’s such a blessing that comes when you teach us your Word and your ways. Even the sting of your correction can be sweet.</verse>
				<verse number="13">It rescues us from our days of trouble until you are ready to punish the wicked.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For the Lord will never walk away from his cherished ones, nor would he forsake his chosen ones who belong to him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Whenever you pronounce judgments, they reveal righteousness. All your devoted lovers will be pleased.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Lord, who will protect me from these wicked ones? If you don’t stand to defend me, who will? I have no one but you!</verse>
				<verse number="17">I would have been killed so many times if you had not been there for me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When I screamed out, “Lord, I’m doomed!” your fiery love was stirred, and you raced to my rescue.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Whenever my busy thoughts were out of control, the soothing comfort of your presence calmed me down and overwhelmed me with delight.</verse>
				<verse number="20">It’s obvious to all; you will have nothing to do with corrupt rulers who pass laws that empower evil and defeat what is right.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For they gang up against the lovers of righteousness and condemn the innocent to death.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But I know that all their evil plans will boomerang back onto them. Every plot they hatch will simply seal their own doom. For you, my God, you will destroy them, giving them what they deserve. For you are my true tower of strength, my safe place, my hideout, and my true shelter.</verse>
				<verse number="23"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="95">
				<verse number="1">Come on, everyone! Let’s sing for joy to the Lord! Let’s shout our loudest praises to our God who saved us!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Everyone come meet his face with a thankful heart. Don’t hold back your praises; make him great by your shouts of joy!</verse>
				<verse number="3">For the Lord is the greatest of all, King-God over all other gods!</verse>
				<verse number="4">In one hand he holds the mysteries of the earth, and in the other he holds the highest mountain peaks.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He’s the owner of every ocean, the engineer and sculptor of earth itself!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Come and kneel before this Creator-God; come and bow before the mighty God, our majestic maker!</verse>
				<verse number="7">For we are those he cares for, and he is the God we worship. So drop everything else and listen to his voice! For this is what he’s saying: “Today, when I speak, don’t even think about turning a deaf ear to me like they did when they tested me at Meribah and Massah, the place where they argued with me, their Creator. Your ancestors challenged me over and over with their complaining, even though I had convinced them of my power and love. They still doubted my care for them.</verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10">So for forty long years I was grieved and disgusted by them. I described them as wicked wanderers whose hearts would not follow my ways or keep my words.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So I made a vow in my anger and declared, ‘They will not enter the resting place I’ve planned for them!’ So don’t you ever be hard-hearted or stubborn like they were! ”</verse>

			<chapter number="96">

				<verse number="2">Don’t stop! Keep on singing! Make his name famous! Tell everyone every day how wonderful he is. Give them the good news of our great Savior. Take the message of his glory and miracles to every nation. Tell them about all the amazing things he has done.</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">For the Lord’s greatness is beyond description, and he deserves all the praise that comes to him. He is our King-God, and it’s right to be in holy awe of him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Other gods are absolutely worthless. For the Lord God is Creator-God, who spread the splendor of the skies!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Breathtaking brilliance and awe-inspiring majesty radiate from his shining presence. His stunning beauty overwhelms all who come before him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Surrender to the Lord Yahweh, all you nations and peoples. Surrender to him all your pride and strength.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Confess that Yahweh alone deserves all the glory and honor. Bring an offering and come celebrate in his courts.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Come worship the Lord God wearing the splendor of holiness. Let everyone wait in wonder as they tremble in awe before him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Tell the nations plainly that Yahweh rules over all! He is doing a great job, and nothing will disrupt him, for he treats everyone fair and square.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Let the skies sing for joy! Let the earth join in the chorus. Let oceans thunder and fields echo this ecstatic praise until every swaying tree of every forest joins in, lifting up their songs of joyous praise to him!</verse>
				<verse number="12"></verse>
				<verse number="13">For here he comes, the Lord God, and he’s ready to judge the world. He will do what’s right and can be trusted to always do what’s fair.</verse>

				<verse number="3">All around him burns a blazing glory-fire consuming all his foes.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When his lightning strikes, it lights up the world. People are wide-eyed as they tremble and shake.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Mountains melt away like wax in a fire when the Lord of all the earth draws near.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Heaven’s messengers preach righteousness, and people everywhere see God’s glory in the sky!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Shame covers all who boast in other gods, for they worship idols. For all the supernatural powers once worshiped the true and living God.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But God’s Zion-people are content, for they know and hear the truth. The people of praise rejoice over all your judgments, O Lord!</verse>
				<verse number="9">For you are King-God, the Most High God over all the earth. You are exalted above every supernatural power!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Listen, you lovers of God! Hate evil, for God can keep you from wrong and protect you from the power of wickedness.</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="101">
				<verse number="1">Lord, I will sing about your faithful love for me. My song of praise will have your justice as its theme.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I’m trying my best to walk in the way of integrity, especially in my own home. But I need your help! I’m wondering, Lord, when will you appear?</verse>
				<verse number="3">I refuse to gaze on that which is vulgar. I despise works of evil people and anything that moves my heart away from you. I will not let evil hold me in its grip.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Every perverse and crooked way I have put away from my heart, for I will have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I will silence those who secretly want to slander my friends, and I will not tolerate the proud and arrogant.</verse>
				<verse number="6">My innermost circle will only be those who I know are pure and godly. They will be the only ones I allow to minister to me.</verse>
				<verse number="7">There’s no room in my home for hypocrites, for I can’t stand chronic liars who flatter and deceive.</verse>
				<verse number="8">At each and every sunrise I will awake to do what’s right and put to silence those who love wickedness, freeing God’s people from their evil grip. I will do all of this because of my great love for you!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="102">
				<verse number="1">Lord, listen to my prayer! Listen to my cry for help!</verse>
				<verse number="2">You can’t hide your face from me in the day of my distress. Stoop down to hear my prayer and answer me quickly, Lord!</verse>
				<verse number="3">For my days of happiness have gone up in smoke. My body is raging with fever, my heart is sick, and I’m consumed by this illness— withered like a dead leaf. I can’t even eat.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">I’m nothing but skin and bones. Nothing’s left of me but whispered groans.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I’m like a pelican of the wilderness, like an owl among the ruins.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I’m sleepless, shivering in the cold, forlorn, and friendless, like a lonely bird on the rooftop.</verse>
				<verse number="8">My every enemy mocks and insults me incessantly. They even use my name as a curse to speak over others!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Because of your great and furious anger against me, all I do is suffer with sorrow, with nothing to eat but a meal of mourning. My crying fills my cup with salty tears! In your wrath you have rejected me, sweeping me away like dirt on the floor.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">My days are marked by the lengthening shadows of death. I’m withering away and there’s nothing left of me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But then I remember that you, O Lord, still sit enthroned as King over all! The fame of your name will be revealed to every generation.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I know you are about to arise and show your tender love to Zion. Now is the time, Lord, for your compassion and mercy to be poured out— the appointed time has come for your prophetic promises to be fulfilled!</verse>
				<verse number="14">For your servants weep in sympathy over Zion’s ruins and feel love for her every stone.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When you arise to intervene, all the nations and kings will be stunned and will fear your awesome name, trembling before your glory!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yes, you will reveal yourself to Zion and appear in the brightness of your glory to restore her and give her children.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He responds to the prayer of the poor and broken and will not despise the cry of the homeless.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Write all this down for the coming generation, so re-created people will read it and praise the Lord!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Tell them how Yah looked down from his high and holy place, gazing from his glory to survey the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="20">He listened to all the groaning of his people longing to be free, and he set loose the sons of death to experience life.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Multitudes will stream to Jerusalem to praise the Lord and declare his name in Zion!</verse>
				<verse number="22">Peoples from every land, their kings and kingdoms, will gather together to worship the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But God has brought me to my knees, shortening my life.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So I cry out to you, my God, Father of eternity, please don’t let me die! I know my life is not yet finished.</verse>
				<verse number="25">With your hands you once formed the foundations of the earth and handcrafted the heavens above.</verse>
				<verse number="26">They will all fade away one day like worn-out clothing, ready to be discarded, but you’ll still be here. You will replace it all! Your first creation will be changed, but you alone will endure, the God of all eternity!</verse>
				<verse number="27"></verse>
				<verse number="28">Generation after generation our descendants will live securely, for you are the one protecting us, keeping us for yourself.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="103">
				<verse number="1">With my whole heart, with my whole life, and with my innermost being, I bow in wonder and love before you, the holy God!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh, you are my soul’s celebration. How could I ever forget the miracles of kindness you’ve done for me?</verse>
				<verse number="3">You kissed my heart with forgiveness, in spite of all I’ve done. You’ve healed me inside and out from every disease.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You’ve rescued me from hell and saved my life. You’ve crowned me with love and mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You satisfy my every desire with good things. You’ve supercharged my life so that I soar again like a flying eagle in the sky!</verse>
				<verse number="6">You’re a God who makes things right, giving justice to the defenseless.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You unveiled to Moses your plans and showed Israel’s sons what you could do.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Lord, you’re so kind and tenderhearted and so patient with people who fail you! Your love is like a flooding river overflowing its banks with kindness.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You don’t look at us only to find our faults, just so that you can hold a grudge against us.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You may discipline us for our many sins, but never as much as we really deserve. Nor do you get even with us for what we’ve done.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Higher than the highest heavens— that’s how high your tender mercy extends! Greater than the grandeur of heaven above is the greatness of your loyal love, towering over all who fear you and bow down before you!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Farther than from a sunrise to a sunset— that’s how far you’ve removed our guilt from us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The same way a loving father feels toward his children— that’s but a sample of your tender feelings toward us, your beloved children, who live in awe of you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You know all about us, inside and out. You are mindful that we’re made from dust.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Our days are so few, and our momentary beauty so swiftly fades away!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then all of a sudden we’re gone, like grass clippings blown away in a gust of wind, taken away to our appointment with death, leaving nothing to show that we were here.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But Lord, your endless love stretches from one eternity to the other, unbroken and unrelenting toward those who fear you and those who bow facedown in awe before you. Your faithfulness to keep every gracious promise you’ve made passes from parents, to children, to grandchildren, and beyond.</verse>
				<verse number="18">You are faithful to all those who follow your ways and keep your word.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yahweh has established his throne in heaven; his kingdom rules the entire universe.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So bless the Lord, all his messengers of power, for you are his mighty heroes who listen intently to the voice of his word to do it.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Bless and praise the Lord, you mighty warriors, ministers who serve him well and fulfill his desires.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I will bless and praise the Lord with my whole heart! Let all his works throughout the earth, wherever his dominion stretches— let everything bless the Lord!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="104">
				<verse number="1">Everything I am will praise and bless the Lord! O Lord, my God, your greatness takes my breath away, overwhelming me by your majesty, beauty, and splendor!</verse>
				<verse number="2">You wrap yourself with a shimmering, glistening light. You wear sunshine like a garment of glory. You stretch out the starry skies like a tapestry.</verse>
				<verse number="3">You build your balconies with light beams and ride as King in a chariot you made from clouds. You fly upon the wings of the wind.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You make your messengers into winds of the Spirit, and all your ministers become flames of fire.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You, our Creator, formed the earth, and you hold it all together so it will never fall apart.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You poured the ocean depths over the planet, submerging mountains beneath.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yet at the sound of your thunder-shout the waters all fled away, filling the deep with seas.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The mountains rose and valleys sank to the levels you decreed for them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then you set a boundary line for the seas and commanded them not to trespass.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You sent springs cascading through the valleys, flowing freely between the mountains and hills.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You provide drink for every living thing; men and beasts have their thirst quenched because of you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The birds build nests near the tranquil streams, chirping their joyous songs from the branches above.</verse>
				<verse number="13">From your kindness you send the rain to water the mountains from the upper rooms of your palace. Your goodness brings forth fruit for all to enjoy.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Your compassion brings the earth’s harvest, feeding the hungry. You cause the grass to grow for livestock, along with the fruit, grains, and vegetables to feed mankind.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You provide sweet wine to gladden hearts. You give us daily bread to sustain life, giving us glowing health for our bodies.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The trees of the Lord drink until they’re satisfied. Lebanon’s lofty trees stand tall right where you planted them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Within their branches you provide for birds a place to build their nests; even herons find a home in the cypress trees.</verse>
				<verse number="18">You make the high mountains a home for wild goats and the rocky crag where the rock badgers burrow.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You made the moon to mark the months and the sun to measure the days.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You turn off the light and it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest come out to prowl.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The mighty lions roar for their dinner, but it’s you, God, who feeds them all.</verse>
				<verse number="22">At sunrise they slink back to their dens to crouch down in the shadows.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then man goes out to his labor and toil, working from dawn to dusk.</verse>
				<verse number="24">O Lord, what an amazing variety of all you have created! Wild and wonderful is this world you have made, while wisdom was there at your side. This world is full of so many creatures, yet each belongs to you!</verse>
				<verse number="25">And then there is the sea! So vast! So wide and deep— swarming with countless forms of sea life, both small and great.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Trading ships glide through the high seas. And look! There are the massive whales bounding upon the waves.</verse>
				<verse number="27">All the creatures wait expectantly for you to give them their food as you determine.</verse>
				<verse number="28">You come near and they all gather around, feasting from your open hands, and each is satisfied from your abundant supply.</verse>
				<verse number="29">But if you were to withhold from them and turn away, they all would panic. And when you choose to take away their breath, each one dies and returns to the dust.</verse>
				<verse number="30">When you release your Spirit-Wind, life is created, ready to replenish life upon the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="31">May God’s glorious splendor endure forever! May the Lord take joy and pleasure in all that he has made.</verse>
				<verse number="32">For the earth’s overseer has the power to make it tremble; just a touch of his finger and volcanoes erupt as the earth shakes and melts.</verse>
				<verse number="33">I will sing my song to the Lord as long as I live! Every day I will sing my praises to God.</verse>
				<verse number="34">May you be pleased with every sweet thought I have about you, for you are the source of my joy and gladness.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Now, let all the sinners be swept from the earth. But I will keep on praising you, my Lord, with all that is within me. My joyous, blissful shouts of “Hallelujah” are all because of you!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="105">
				<verse number="1">Go ahead and give God thanks for all the glorious things he has done! Go ahead and worship him! Tell everyone about his wonders!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Let’s sing his praises! Sing, and put all of his miracles to music!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Shine and make your joyful boast in him, you lovers of God. Let’s be happy and keep rejoicing no matter what.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Seek more of his strength! Seek more of him! Let’s always be seeking the light of his face.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Don’t you ever forget his miracles and marvels. Hold to your heart every judgment he has decreed.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For you are his servants, the true seed of Abraham, and you are the chosen ones, Jacob’s sons.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For he is the Lord our God, and his wise authority can be seen in all he does.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For though a thousand generations may pass away, he is still true to his word. He has kept every promise he made to Abraham and to Isaac.</verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10">His promises have become an everlasting covenant to Jacob, as a decree to Jacob.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He said to them, “I will give you all the land of Canaan as your inheritance.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">They were very few in number when God gave them that promise, and they were all foreigners to that land.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They were wandering from one land to another and from one kingdom to another.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yet God would not permit anyone to touch them, punishing even kings who came against them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He said to them, “Don’t you dare lay a hand on my anointed ones, and don’t do a thing to hurt my prophets!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So God decreed a famine upon Canaan-land, cutting off their food supply.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But he had already sent a man ahead of his people to Egypt; it was Joseph, who was sold as a slave.</verse>
				<verse number="18">His feet were bruised by strong shackles and his soul was held by iron.</verse>
				<verse number="19">God’s promise to Joseph purged his character until it was time for his dreams to come true.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Eventually, the king of Egypt sent for him, setting him free at last.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then Joseph was put in charge of everything under the king; he became the master of the palace over all the royal possessions.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Pharoah gave him authority over all the princes of the land, and Joseph became the teacher of wisdom to the king’s advisers.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then Jacob, with all of Joseph’s family, came from Canaan to Egypt and settled in Goshen.</verse>
				<verse number="24">God made them very fruitful, and they multiplied incredibly until they were greater in number than those who ruled them.</verse>
				<verse number="25">God turned their hearts to hate his people and to deal treacherously with his servants.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But he sent them his faithful servant, Moses, the deliverer, and chose Aaron to accompany him.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Their command brought down signs and wonders, working miracles in Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="28">By God’s direction, they spoke and released a plague of thick darkness over the land.</verse>
				<verse number="29">God turned their rivers to blood, causing every fish to die.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And the judgment-plague of frogs came in enormous numbers, swarming everywhere, even into Pharaoh’s bedroom!</verse>
				<verse number="31">God spoke and another plague was released— massive swarms of flies, vast clouds of insects, covered the land.</verse>
				<verse number="32">God rained down hail and flaming fire upon Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Their gardens and vines were all destroyed, shattering trees into splinters throughout the territory.</verse>
				<verse number="34">God spoke, and devouring hordes of locusts swept over the land,</verse>
				<verse number="35">picking the ground clean of vegetation and crops.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then God struck down their firstborn sons, the pride and joy of every Egyptian family.</verse>
				<verse number="37">At last, God freed all the Hebrews from their slavery and sent them away laden with the silver and gold of Egypt. And not even one was feeble on their way out!</verse>
				<verse number="38">Egypt was relieved at their exodus, ready to see them go, for the terror of the Lord of the Hebrews had fallen upon them!</verse>
				<verse number="39">God spread out a cloud as shade as they moved ahead and a cloud of fire to light up their night.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Moses prayed and God brought them quail to eat. He satisfied them with heaven’s bread falling from the sky.</verse>
				<verse number="41">He broke open the boulder and the waters poured out like a river in the desert.</verse>
				<verse number="42">For God could never forget his holy promise to his servant Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="43">So God brought out his chosen ones with singing; with a joyful shout they were set free!</verse>
				<verse number="44">He gave them lands and nations, just like he promised. Fruitful lands of crops they had never planted were now theirs.</verse>
				<verse number="45">All this was done for them so that they would be faithful to keep the ways of God, obeying his laws and following his truths. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="106">
				<verse number="1">Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Everyone thank God, for he is good and easy to please. Your tender love for us, Lord, continues on forever.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Who could ever fully describe your glorious miracles? Yahweh, who could ever praise you enough?</verse>
				<verse number="3">The happiest one on earth is the one who keeps your word and clings to righteousness every moment.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So remember me, Lord, as you take joy in your people. And when you come to bring the blessings of salvation, don’t forget me!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Let me share in the wealth and beauty of all your devoted lovers, rejoice with your nation in all their joys, and let me share in the glory you give to your chosen ones.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We have all sinned so much, just like our fathers. “Guilty” is written over our lives.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Our fathers who were delivered from Egypt didn’t fully understand your wonders, and they took you for granted. Over and over you showed them such tender love and mercy! Yet they were barely beyond the Red Sea when they rebelled against you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Nonetheless, you saved them more than once so they would know how powerful you are, showing them the honor of your name.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You roared over the waters of the Red Sea, making a dry path for your people to cross through.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You freed them from the strong power of those who oppressed them and rescued them from bondage.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then the waters rushed over their enemies and drowned them all— not one survived.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Seeing this, the people believed your words, and they all broke out with songs of praise!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yet how quickly they forgot your miracles of power. They wouldn’t wait for you to act when they were hungry,</verse>
				<verse number="14">but demanded you satisfy their cravings and give them food! They tested you to the breaking point.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So you gave them what they wanted to eat, but their souls starved away to nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They became envious of Moses and Aaron, your holy ones.</verse>
				<verse number="17">You split open the earth, and it swallowed up Dathan and Abiram along with their followers.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Fire fell from heaven and burnt up all the band of rebels, turning them to ashes.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They made an idol of a calf at Sinai and bowed to worship their man-made statue.</verse>
				<verse number="20">They preferred the image of a grass-eating ox to the presence of the glory-filled God.</verse>
				<verse number="21">They totally forgot it was you who saved them by the wonders and awesome miracles you worked in Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23">So you decided to destroy them. But Moses, your chosen leader, stood in the gap between you and the people and made intercession on their behalf to turn away your wrath from killing them all.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Yet they still didn’t believe your words and they despised the land of delight you gave to them.</verse>
				<verse number="25">They grumbled and found fault with everything and closed their hearts to your voice.</verse>
				<verse number="26">So you solemnly swore to them that they would all die in the desert.</verse>
				<verse number="27">And you scattered their children to distant lands to die as exiles.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then our fathers joined the worshipers of the false god named “Lord of the Pit.” They even ate the sacrifices offered to the dead!</verse>
				<verse number="29">All they did made you burn with anger. It made you so angry that a plague broke out among them!</verse>
				<verse number="30">It continued until Phineas intervened and executed the guilty for causing judgment to fall upon them.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Because of this deed of righteousness Phineas will be remembered forever.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Your people also provoked you to wrath at the stream called Strife. This is where Moses got into serious trouble!</verse>
				<verse number="33">Because the people were rebellious against you, Moses exploded in anger and spoke to them out of his bitterness.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Neither did our fathers destroy the enemies in the land, as you had commanded them.</verse>
				<verse number="35">But they mingled themselves with their enemies and learned to copy their works of darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="36">They began to serve their gods and bow before their idols. All of this led them away from you and brought about their downfall.</verse>
				<verse number="37">They even sacrificed their little children to the demon spirits,</verse>
				<verse number="38">shedding the innocent blood of their sons and daughters. These dark practices greatly defiled the land and their own souls, through the murder and bloodshed of their own babies! Their sins made them spiritual adulterers before you.</verse>
				<verse number="39"></verse>
				<verse number="40">This is why you were furious. As your anger burned hot against them, you couldn’t even stand to look at your very own people any longer!</verse>
				<verse number="41">So you turned them over to the crushing hands of other nations, and those who hated them became tyrants over them.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Oppressive enemies subdued them, ruling over them with their tyranny.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Many times you would have come to rescue them, but they continued in their rebellious ways, choosing to ignore your warnings. Then they sank lower and lower, destroyed by their depravity.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Yet even so, you waited and waited, watching to see if they would turn and cry out to you for a father’s help. And then, when you heard their cry, you relented and you remembered your covenant, and you turned your heart toward them again, according to your abundant, overflowing, and limitless love.</verse>
				<verse number="45"></verse>
				<verse number="46">Then you caused even their oppressors to pity them and show them compassion.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Do it again, Lord! Save us, O Lord, our God! Gather us from our exile and unite us together so that we will give our great and joyous thanks to you again and bring you glory by our praises.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Blessed be our Lord God forever and ever. And let everyone everywhere say, “Hallelujah!” Amen! Faithful is our King!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="107">
				<verse number="1">Let everyone give all their praise and thanks to the Lord! Here’s why—he’s better than anyone could ever imagine. Yes, he’s always loving and kind, and his faithful love never ends.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So, go ahead—let everyone know it! Tell the world how he broke through and delivered you from the power of darkness and has gathered us together from all over the world. He has set us free to be his very own!</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">Some of us once wandered in the wilderness like desert nomads, with no true direction or dwelling place.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Starving, thirsting, staggering, we became desperate and filled with despair.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then we cried out, “Lord, help us! Rescue us!” And he did!</verse>
				<verse number="7">He led us out by the right way until we reached a suitable city to dwell in.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So lift your hands and thank God for his marvelous kindness and for all his miracles of mercy for those he loves.</verse>
				<verse number="9">How he satisfies the souls of thirsty ones and fills the hungry with goodness!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Some of us once sat in darkness, living in the dark shadows of death. We were prisoners to our pain, chained to our regrets.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For we rebelled against God’s Word and rejected the wise counsel of God Most High.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So he humbled us through our circumstances, watching us as we stumbled, with no one there to pick us back up. Our own pain became our punishment.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then we cried out, “Lord, help us! Rescue us!” And he did!</verse>
				<verse number="14">His light broke through the darkness and he led us out in freedom from death’s dark shadow and snapped every one of our chains.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So lift your hands and give thanks to God for his marvelous kindness and for his miracles of mercy for those he loves!</verse>
				<verse number="16">For he smashed through heavy prison doors and shattered the steel bars that held us back, just to set us free!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Some of us were such fools, bringing on ourselves sorrow and suffering all because of our sins.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Sick and feeble, unable to stand the sight of food, we drew near to the gates of death.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then we cried out, “Lord, help us! Rescue us!” And he did!</verse>
				<verse number="20">God spoke the words “Be healed,” and we were healed, delivered from death’s door!</verse>
				<verse number="21">So lift your hands and give thanks to God for his marvelous kindness and for his miracles of mercy for those he loves!</verse>
				<verse number="22">Bring your praise as an offering and your thanks as a sacrifice as you sing your story of miracles with a joyful song.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Some of us set sail upon the sea to faraway ports, transporting our goods from ship to shore.</verse>
				<verse number="24">We were witnesses of God’s power out in the ocean deep; we saw breathtaking wonders upon the high seas.</verse>
				<verse number="25">When God spoke he stirred up a storm, lifting high the waves with hurricane winds.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Ships were tossed by the swelling sea, rising to the sky, then dropping down to the depths, reeling like drunkards, spinning like tops, everyone at their wits’ end until even sailors despaired of life, cringing in terror.</verse>
				<verse number="27"></verse>
				<verse number="28">Then we cried out, “Lord, help us! Rescue us!” And he did!</verse>
				<verse number="29">God stilled the storm, calmed the waves, and he hushed the hurricane winds to only a whisper.</verse>
				<verse number="30">We were so relieved, so glad as he guided us safely to harbor in a quiet haven.</verse>
				<verse number="31">So lift your hands and give thanks to God for his marvelous kindness and for his miracles of mercy for those he loves!</verse>
				<verse number="32">Let’s exalt him on high and lift up our praises in public; let all the people and the leaders of the nation know how great and wonderful is Yahweh, our God!</verse>
				<verse number="33">Whenever he chooses he can dry up a river and turn the land into a desert.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Or he can take a fruitful land and make it into a saltwater swamp, all because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.</verse>
				<verse number="35">But he also can turn a barren wilderness into an oasis with water! He can make springs flow into desert lands</verse>
				<verse number="36">and turn them into fertile valleys so that cities spring up, and he gives it all to those who are hungry.</verse>
				<verse number="37">They can plant their fields and vineyards there and reap a bumper crop and gather a fruitful harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="38">God will bless them and cause them to multiply and prosper.</verse>
				<verse number="39">But others will become poor, humbled because of their oppression, tyranny, and sorrows.</verse>
				<verse number="40">For God pours contempt upon their arrogant abuse of power, heaping scorn upon their princes, and makes them wander among ruins.</verse>
				<verse number="41">But he raises up the poor and lowly with his favor, giving them a safe place to live where no one can touch them. God will grant them a large family and bless them!</verse>
				<verse number="42">The lovers of God will rejoice when they see this. Good men are glad when the evil ones are silenced.</verse>
				<verse number="43">If you are truly wise, you’ll learn from what I’ve told you. It’s time for you to consider these profound lessons of God’s great love and mercy!</verse>

				<verse number="1">My heart, O God, is focused and determined. Now I can sing my song with passionate praises! Awake, O my soul, with the music of his splendor.</verse>

				<verse number="3">Wherever I go, I will thank you. All the nations will hear my praise songs to you.</verse>

				<verse number="7">Then I heard the Lord speak in his holy splendor, and from his sanctuary I heard the Lord promise: “In my triumph I will be the one to measure out the portion of my inheritance to my people, and I will secure the land as I promised you. Shechem, Succoth, Gilead, Manasseh — they are all still mine!” he says. “Judah will continue to produce kings and lawgivers, and Ephraim will produce great warriors. Moab will become my lowly servant. Edom will likewise serve my purposes. I will lift up a shout of victory over the land of Philistia!</verse>

				<verse number="10">But who will bring my triumph into Edom’s fortresses?”</verse>

				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16">because he never once showed love or kindness to others, but persecuted the poor, the brokenhearted, and afflicted ones, even putting them to death!</verse>

				<verse number="23">I’m slipping down a dark slope, shaken to the core, and helpless.</verse>
				<verse number="24">All my fasting has left me so weak I can hardly stand. Now I’m shriveled up, nothing but skin and bones.</verse>

Their futile faith in dead idols and dead works can never bring life or meaning to their souls. Blind men can only create blind things. Those deaf to God can only make a deaf image.

				<verse number="4">The nations, with their flood of rage, would have swept us away, and we would have drowned and perished beneath their torrent of terror!</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>

				<verse number="4">Now, Lord, do it again! Restore us to our former glory! May streams of your refreshing flow over us until our dry hearts are drenched again.</verse>

				<verse number="1">If God’s grace doesn’t help the builders, they will labor in vain to build a house. If God’s mercy doesn’t protect the city, all the sentries will circle it in vain.</verse>
				<verse number="2">It really is senseless to work so hard from early morning till late at night, toiling to make a living for fear of not having enough. God can provide for his devoted lovers even while they sleep!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Children are God’s love-gift; they are heaven’s generous reward.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Children born to a young couple will one day rise to protect and provide for their parents.</verse>

				<verse number="10">Don’t forsake your anointed king now, but honor your servant David.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For you gave your word and promised David in an unbreakable oath that one of his sons would be sitting on the throne to succeed him as king.</verse>

				<verse number="1">How truly wonderful and delightful it is to see brothers and sisters living together in sweet unity!</verse>
				<verse number="2">It’s as precious as the sacred scented oil flowing from the head of the high priest Aaron, dripping down upon his beard and running all the way down to the hem of his priestly robes.</verse>
				<verse number="3">This harmony can be compared to the dew dripping from Mount Hermon, which flows down upon the hills of Zion. Indeed, that is where Yahweh has decreed his blessings will be found, the promise of life forevermore!</verse>

				<verse number="16">Their possessions will never satisfy. Their lifeless and futile works cannot bring life to them! Their things can’t talk to them or answer their prayers. Blind men can only create blind things. Those deaf to God can only make a deaf image. Dead men can only create dead idols.

				<verse number="8">You’re kind and tenderhearted to those who don’t deserve it and very patient with people who fail you. Your love is like a flooding river overflowing its banks with kindness.</verse>
				<verse number="9">God, everyone sees your goodness, for your tender love is blended into everything you do.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Everything you have made will praise you, fulfilling its purpose. And all your godly ones will be found bowing before you.</verse>

				<verse number="2">I will spend my life praising you and singing high praises to you, my God, every day of my life!</verse>
				<verse number="3">We can never look to men for help; no matter who they are, they can’t save us, for even our great leaders fail and fall. They too are just mortals who will one day die. At death the spirits of all depart and their bodies return to dust. In the day of their death all their projects and plans are over.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">Here are kingdom revelations, words to live by, and words of wisdom given to empower you to reign in life, written as proverbs by Israel’s King Solomon, David’s son.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Within these sayings will be found the revelation of wisdom and the impartation of spiritual understanding. Use them as keys to unlock the treasures of true knowledge.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Those who cling to these words will receive discipline to demonstrate wisdom in every relationship and to choose what is right and just and fair.</verse>
				<verse number="4">These proverbs will give you great skill to teach the immature and make them wise, to give youth the understanding of their design and destiny.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For the wise, these proverbs will make you even wiser, and for those with discernment, you will be able to acquire brilliant strategies for leadership.</verse>
				<verse number="6">These kingdom revelations will break open your understanding to unveil the deeper meaning of parables, poetic riddles, and epigrams, and to unravel the words and enigmas of the wise.</verse>
				<verse number="7">We cross the threshold of true knowledge when we live in obedient devotion to God. Stubborn know-it-alls will never stop to do this, for they scorn true wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Pay close attention, my child, to your father’s wise words and never forget your mother’s instructions.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For their insight will bring you success, adorning you with grace-filled thoughts and giving you reins to guide your decisions.</verse>
				<verse number="10">When peer pressure compels you to go with the crowd and sinners invite you to join in, you must simply say, “No!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">When the gang says— “We’re going to steal and kill and get away with it.</verse>
				<verse number="12">We’ll take down the rich and rob them. We’ll swallow them up alive and take what we want from whomever we want.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then we’ll take their treasures and fill our homes with loot.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So come on and join us. Take your chance with us. We’ll divide up all we get; we’ll each end up with big bags of cash!”—</verse>
				<verse number="15">my son, refuse to go with them and stay far away from them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For crime is their way of life and bloodshed their specialty.</verse>
				<verse number="17">To be aware of their snare is the best way of escape.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They’ll resort to murder to steal their victim’s assets, but eventually it will be their own lives that are ambushed.</verse>
				<verse number="19">In their ungodly disrespect for God they bring destruction on their own lives.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Wisdom’s praises are sung in the streets and celebrated far and wide.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yet wisdom’s song is not always heard in the halls of higher learning. But in the hustle and bustle of everyday life its lyrics can always be heard above the din of the crowd. You will hear wisdom’s warning as she preaches courageously to those who stop to listen:</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Foolish ones, how much longer will you cling to your deception? How much longer will you mock wisdom, you cynical scorners who fight the facts?</verse>
				<verse number="23">Come back to your senses and be restored to reality. Don’t even think about refusing my rebuke! Don’t you know that I’m ready to pour out my spirit of wisdom upon you and bring to you the revelation of my words that will make your heart wise?</verse>
				<verse number="24">I’ve called to you over and over; still you refuse to come to me. I’ve pleaded with you again and again, yet you’ve turned a deaf ear to my voice.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Because you have laughed at my counsel and have insisted on continuing in your stubbornness,</verse>
				<verse number="26">I will laugh when your calamity comes and will turn away from you at the time of your disaster. Make a joke of my advice, will you? Then I’ll make a joke out of you!</verse>
				<verse number="27">When the storm clouds of terror gather over your head, when dread and distress consume you and your catastrophe comes like a hurricane,</verse>
				<verse number="28">you will cry out to me, but I won’t answer. Then it will be too late to expect my help. When desperation drives you to search for me, I will be nowhere to be found.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Because you have turned up your nose at me and closed your eyes to the facts and refused to worship me in awe —</verse>
				<verse number="30">because you scoffed at my wise counsel and laughed at my correction—</verse>
				<verse number="31">now you will eat the bitter fruit of your own ways. You’ve made your own bed; now lie in it! So how do you like that?</verse>
				<verse number="32">Like an idiot you’ve turned away from me and chosen destruction instead. Your self-satisfied smugness will kill you.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But the one who always listens to me will live undisturbed in a heavenly peace. Free from fear, confident and courageous, that one will rest unafraid and sheltered from the storms of life.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">My child, will you treasure my wisdom? Then, and only then, will you acquire it. And only if you accept my advice and hide it within will you succeed.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So train your heart to listen when I speak and open your spirit wide to expand your discernment— then pass it on to your sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yes, cry out for comprehension and intercede for insight.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For if you keep seeking it like a man would seek for sterling silver, searching in hidden places for cherished treasure,</verse>
				<verse number="5">then you will discover the fear of the Lord and find the true knowledge of God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Wisdom is a gift from a generous God, and every word he speaks is full of revelation and becomes a fountain of understanding within you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For the Lord has a hidden storehouse of wisdom made accessible to his godly ones. He becomes your personal bodyguard as you follow his ways, protecting and guarding you as you choose what is right.</verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">Then you will discover all that is just, proper, and fair, and be empowered to make the right decisions as you walk into your destiny.</verse>
				<verse number="10">When wisdom wins your heart and revelation breaks in, true pleasure enters your soul.</verse>
				<verse number="11">If you choose to follow good counsel, divine design will watch over you and understanding will protect you from making poor choices.</verse>
				<verse number="12">It will rescue you from evil in disguise and from those who speak duplicities.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For they have left the paths of righteousness and walk in the ways of darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They take pleasure when evil prospers and thoroughly enjoy a lifestyle of sin.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But they’re walking on a path to nowhere, wandering away into deeper deception.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Only wisdom can save you from the flattery of the promiscuous woman— she’s such a smooth-talking seductress!</verse>
				<verse number="17">She left her husband and has forgotten her wedding vows.</verse>
				<verse number="18">You’ll find her house on the road to hell,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and all the men who go through her doors will never come back to the place they were— they will find nothing but desolation and despair.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Follow those who follow wisdom and stay on the right path.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For all my godly lovers will enjoy life to the fullest and will inherit their destinies.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But the treacherous ones who love darkness will lose not only all they could have had, but even their own souls!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">My child, if you truly want a long and satisfying life, never forget the things that I’ve taught you. Follow closely every truth that I’ve given you. Then you will have a full, rewarding life.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">Hold on to loyal love and don’t let go, and be faithful to all that you’ve been taught. Let your life be shaped by integrity, with truth written upon your heart.</verse>
				<verse number="4">That’s how you will find favor and understanding with both God and men— you will gain the reputation of living life well.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Trust in the Lord completely, and do not rely on your own opinions. With all your heart rely on him to guide you, and he will lead you in every decision you make.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Become intimate with him in whatever you do, and he will lead you wherever you go.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Don’t think for a moment that you know it all, for wisdom comes when you adore him with undivided devotion and avoid everything that’s wrong.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then you will find the healing refreshment your body and spirit long for.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Glorify God with all your wealth, honoring him with your firstfruits, with every increase that comes to you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then every dimension of your life will overflow with blessings from an uncontainable source of inner joy!</verse>
				<verse number="11">My child, when the Lord God speaks to you, never take his words lightly, and never be upset when he corrects you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For the Father’s discipline comes only from his passionate love and pleasure for you. Even when it seems like his correction is harsh, it’s still better than any father on earth gives to his child.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Blessings pour over the ones who find wisdom, for they have obtained living-understanding.</verse>
				<verse number="14">As wisdom increases, a great treasure is imparted, greater than many bars of refined gold.</verse>
				<verse number="15">It is a more valuable commodity than gold and gemstones, for there is nothing you desire that could compare to her.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Wisdom extends to you long life in one hand and wealth and promotion in the other. Out of her mouth flows righteousness, and her words release both law and mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The ways of wisdom are sweet, always drawing you into the place of wholeness.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Seeking for her brings the discovery of untold blessings, for she is the healing tree of life to those who taste her fruits.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The Lord laid the earth’s foundations with wisdom’s blueprints. By his living-understanding all the universe came into being.</verse>
				<verse number="20">By his divine revelation he broke open the hidden fountains of the deep, bringing secret springs to the surface as the mist of the night dripped down from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="21">My child, never drift off course from these two goals for your life: to walk in wisdom and to discover your purpose. Don’t ever forget how they empower you.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For they strengthen you inside and out and inspire you to do what’s right; you will be energized and refreshed by the healing they bring.</verse>
				<verse number="23">They give you living hope to guide you, and not one of life’s tests will cause you to stumble.</verse>
				<verse number="24">You will sleep like a baby, safe and sound— your rest will be sweet and secure.</verse>
				<verse number="25">You will not be subject to terror, for it will not terrify you. Nor will the disrespectful be able to push you aside,</verse>
				<verse number="26">because God is your confidence in times of crisis, keeping your heart at rest in every situation.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Why would you withhold payment on your debt when you have the ability to pay? Just do it!</verse>
				<verse number="28">When your friend comes to ask you for a favor, why would you say, “Perhaps tomorrow,” when you have the money right there in your pocket? Help him today!</verse>
				<verse number="29">Why would you hold a grudge in your heart toward your neighbor who lives right next door?</verse>
				<verse number="30">And why would you quarrel with those who have done nothing wrong to you? Is that a chip on your shoulder?</verse>
				<verse number="31">Don’t act like those bullies or learn their ways.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Every violent thug is despised by the Lord, but every tender lover finds friendship with God and will hear his intimate secrets.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The wicked walk under God’s constant curse, but the righteous walk under a stream of his blessing, for they seek to do what is right.</verse>
				<verse number="34">If you walk with the mockers you will learn to mock, but God’s grace and favor flow to the meek.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Stubborn fools fill their lives with disgrace, but glory and honor rest upon the wise.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Listen to my correction, my sons, for I speak to you as your father. Let discernment enter your heart and you will grow wise with the understanding I impart.</verse>
				<verse number="2">My revelation-truth is a gift to you, so remain faithful to my instruction.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For I, too, was once the delight of my father and cherished by my mother—their beloved child.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then my father taught me, saying, “Never forget my words. If you do everything that I teach you, you will reign in life.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So make wisdom your quest— search for the revelation of life’s meaning. Don’t let what I say go in one ear and out the other.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Stick with wisdom and she will stick to you, protecting you throughout your days. She will rescue all those who passionately listen to her voice.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Wisdom is the most valuable commodity—so buy it! Revelation-knowledge is what you need—so invest in it!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Wisdom will exalt you when you exalt her truth. She will lead you to honor and favor when you live your life by her insights.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You will be adorned with beauty and grace, and wisdom’s glory will wrap itself around you, making you victorious in the race.</verse>
				<verse number="10">My son, if you will take the time to stop and listen to me and embrace what I say, you will live a long and happy life full of understanding in every way.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I have taken you by the hand in wisdom’s ways, pointing you to the path of integrity.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Your progress will have no limits when you come along with me, and you will never stumble as you walk along the way.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So receive my correction no matter how hard it is to swallow, for wisdom will snap you back into place— her words will be invigorating life to you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Do not detour into darkness or even set foot on that path.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Stay away from it; don’t even go there!</verse>
				<verse number="16">For troublemakers are restless if they are not involved in evil. They are not satisfied until they have brought someone harm.</verse>
				<verse number="17">They feed on darkness and drink until they’re drunk on the wine of wickedness.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But the lovers of God walk on the highway of light, and their way shines brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But the wicked walk in thick darkness, like those who travel in fog, and yet don’t have a clue why they keep stumbling!</verse>
				<verse number="20">Listen carefully, my dear child, to everything that I teach you, and pay attention to all that I have to say.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Fill your thoughts with my words until they penetrate deep into your spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then, as you unwrap my words, they will impart true life and radiant health into the very core of your being.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So above all, guard the affections of your heart, for they affect all that you are. Pay attention to the welfare of your innermost being, for from there flows the wellspring of life.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Avoid dishonest speech and pretentious words. Be free from using perverse words no matter what!</verse>
				<verse number="25">Set your gaze on the path before you. With fixed purpose, looking straight ahead, ignore life’s distractions.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Watch where you’re going! Stick to the path of truth, and the road will be safe and smooth before you.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Don’t allow yourself to be sidetracked for even a moment or take the detour that leads to darkness.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Listen to me, my son, for I know what I’m talking about. Listen carefully to my advice</verse>
				<verse number="2">so that wisdom and discernment will enter your heart, and then the words you speak will express what you’ve learned.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Remember this: The lips of a seductress seem sweet like honey, and her smooth words are like music in your ears.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But I promise you this: In the end all you’ll be left with is a bitter conscience. For the sting of your sin will pierce your soul like a sword.</verse>
				<verse number="5">She will ruin your life, drag you down to death, and lead you straight to hell.</verse>
				<verse number="6">She has prevented many from considering the paths of life. Yes, she will take you with her where you don’t want to go, sliding down a slippery road and not even realizing where the two of you will end up!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Listen to me, young men, and don’t forget this one thing I’m telling you— run away from her as fast as you can!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Don’t even go near the door of her house unless you want to fall into her seduction.</verse>
				<verse number="9">In disgrace you will relinquish your honor to another, and all your remaining years will be squandered— given over to the cruel one.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Why would you let strangers take away your strength while the labors of your house go to someone else?</verse>
				<verse number="11">For when you grow old you will groan in anguish and shame as sexually transmitted diseases consume your body.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And then finally you’ll admit that you were wrong and say, “If only I had listened to wisdom’s voice and not stubbornly demanded my own way, because my heart hated to be told what to do!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Why didn’t I take seriously the warning of my wise counselors? Why was I so stupid to think that I could get away with it?</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now I’m totally disgraced and my life is ruined! I’m paying the price— for the people of the congregation are now my judges.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">My son, share your love with your wife alone. Drink from her well of pleasure and from no other.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Why would you have sex with a stranger or with anyone other than her?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Reserve this pleasure for you and her alone and do not share it with another.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Your sex life will be blessed as you take joy and pleasure in the wife of your youth.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Let her breasts be your satisfaction, and let her embrace intoxicate you at all times. Be continually delighted and ravished with her love!</verse>
				<verse number="20">My son, why would you be exhilarated by an adulteress— by embracing a woman who is not yours?</verse>
				<verse number="21">For God sees everything you do and his eyes are wide open as he observes every single habit you have.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Beware that your sins don’t overtake you and that the scars of your own conscience don’t become the ropes that tie you up.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Those who choose wickedness die for lack of self-control, for their foolish ways lead them astray, carrying them away as hostages— kidnapped captives robbed of destiny.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">My son, if you cosign a loan for an acquaintance and guarantee his debt, you’ll be sorry that you ever did it!</verse>
				<verse number="2">You’ll be trapped by your promise and legally bound by the agreement. So listen carefully to my advice:</verse>
				<verse number="3">Quickly get out of it if you possibly can! Swallow your pride, get over your embarrassment, and go tell your “friend” you want your name off that contract.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Don’t put it off, and don’t rest until you get it done.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Rescue yourself from future pain and be free from it once and for all. You’ll be so relieved that you did!</verse>
				<verse number="6">When you’re feeling lazy, come and learn a lesson from this tale of the tiny ant. Yes, all you lazybones, come learn from the example of the ant and enter into wisdom.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The ants have no chief, no boss, no manager— no one has to tell them what to do.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You’ll see them working and toiling all summer long, stockpiling their food in preparation for winter.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So wake up, sleepyhead. How long will you lie there? When will you wake up and get out of bed?</verse>
				<verse number="10">If you keep nodding off and thinking, “I’ll do it later,” or say to yourself, “I’ll just sit back awhile and take it easy,” just watch how the future unfolds!</verse>
				<verse number="11">By making excuses you’ll learn what it means to go without. Poverty will pounce on you like a bandit and move in as your roommate for life.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Here’s another life lesson to learn from observing wayward and wicked men. You can tell they are lawless. They’re constant liars, proud deceivers, full of clever ploys and convincing plots.</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">Their twisted thoughts are perverse, and they are always scheming to stir up trouble, and sowing strife with every step they take.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But when calamity comes knocking on their door, suddenly and without warning they’re undone— broken to bits, shattered, with no hope of healing.</verse>
				<verse number="16">There are six evils God truly hates and a seventh that is an abomination to him:</verse>
				<verse number="17">Putting others down while considering yourself superior, spreading lies and rumors, spilling the blood of the innocent,</verse>
				<verse number="18">plotting evil in your heart toward another, gloating over doing what’s plainly wrong,</verse>
				<verse number="19">spouting lies in false testimony, and stirring up strife between friends. These are entirely despicable to God!</verse>
				<verse number="20">My son, obey your father’s godly instruction and follow your mother’s life-giving teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Fill your heart with their advice and let your life be shaped by what they’ve taught you.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Their wisdom will guide you wherever you go and keep you from bringing harm to yourself. Their instruction will whisper to you at every sunrise and direct you through a brand-new day.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For truth is a bright beam of light shining into every area of your life, instructing and correcting you to discover the ways to godly living.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Truth will protect you from immorality and from the promiscuity of another man’s wife. Your heart won’t be enticed by her flatteries or lust over her beauty— nor will her suggestive ways conquer you.</verse>
				<verse number="25"></verse>
				<verse number="26">Prostitutes reduce a man to poverty, and the adulteress steals your soul— she may even cost you your life!</verse>
				<verse number="27">For how can a man light his pants on fire and not be burned?</verse>
				<verse number="28">Can he walk over hot coals of fire and not blister his feet?</verse>
				<verse number="29">What makes you think that you can sleep with another man’s wife and not get caught? Do you really think you’ll get away with it? Don’t you know it will ruin your life?</verse>
				<verse number="30">You can almost excuse a thief if he steals to feed his own family.</verse>
				<verse number="31">But if he’s caught, he still has to pay back what he stole sevenfold; his punishment and fine will cost him greatly.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Don’t be so stupid as to think you can get away with your adultery. It will destroy your life, and you’ll pay the price for the rest of your days.</verse>
				<verse number="33">You’ll discover what humiliation, shame, and disgrace are all about, for no one will ever let you forget what you’ve done.</verse>
				<verse number="34">A husband’s jealousy makes a man furious; he won’t spare you when he comes to take revenge.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Try all you want to talk your way out of it— offer him a bribe and see if you can manipulate him with your money. Nothing will turn him aside when he comes to you with vengeance in his eyes!</verse>

				<verse number="1">Stick close to my instruction, my son, and follow all my advice.</verse>
				<verse number="2">If you do what I say you will live well. Guard your life with my revelation-truth, for my teaching is as precious as your eyesight.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Treasure my instructions, and cherish them within your heart.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Say to wisdom, “I love you,” and to understanding, “You’re my sweetheart.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">“May the two of you protect me, and may we never be apart!” For they will keep you from the adulteress, with her smooth words meant to seduce your heart.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Looking out the window of my house one day</verse>
				<verse number="7">I noticed among the mindless crowd a simple, naïve young man who was about to go astray.</verse>
				<verse number="8">There he was, walking down the street. Then he turned the corner, going on his way hurrying to the house of the harlot— the woman he had planned to meet.</verse>
				<verse number="9">There he was in the twilight as darkness fell, convinced no one was watching as he entered the black shadows of hell.</verse>
				<verse number="10">That’s when their rendezvous began. A woman of the night appeared, dressed to kill the strength of any man. She was decked out as a harlot, pursuing her amorous plan.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Her voice was seductive, rebellious, and boisterous as she wandered far from what’s right.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Her type can be found soliciting on street corners on just about any night.</verse>
				<verse number="13">She wrapped her arms around the senseless young man and held him tight— she enticed him with kisses that seemed so right. Then, with insolence, she whispered in his ear,</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Come with me. It’ll be all right. I’ve got everything we need for a feast. I’ll cook you a wonderful dinner. So here I am—I’m all yours!</verse>
				<verse number="15">You’re the very one I’ve looked for, the one I knew I wanted from the moment I saw you. That’s why I’ve come out here tonight, so I could meet a man just like you.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I’ve spread my canopy bed with coverings, lovely multicolored Egyptian linens ready for you to lie down on.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I’ve sprinkled the sheets with intoxicating perfume made from myrrh, aloes, and sweet cinnamon.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Come, let’s get comfortable and take pleasure in each other and make love all night!</verse>
				<verse number="19">There’s no one home, for my husband’s away on business.</verse>
				<verse number="20">He left home loaded with money to spend, so don’t worry. He won’t be back until another month ends.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">He was swayed by her sophistication, enticed by her longing embrace. She led him down the wayward path right into sin and disgrace. Quickly he went astray, with no clue where he was truly headed, taken like a dumb ox alongside the butcher. She was like a venomous snake coiled to strike, so she set her fangs into him!</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23">He’s like a man about to be executed with an arrow right through his heart— like a bird that flies into the net, unaware of what’s about to happen.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So listen to me, you young men. You’d better take my words seriously!</verse>
				<verse number="25">Control your sexual urges and guard your hearts against lust. Don’t let your passions get out of hand and don’t lock your eyes onto a beautiful woman. Why would you want to even get close to temptation and seduction, to have an affair with her?</verse>
				<verse number="26">She has pierced the souls of multitudes of men— many mighty ones have fallen and have been brought down by her.</verse>
				<verse number="27">If you’re looking for the road to hell, just go looking for her house!</verse>

				<verse number="17">I will show my love to those who passionately love me. For they will search and search continually until they find me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Unending wealth and glory come to those who discover where I dwell. The riches of righteousness and a long, satisfying life will be given to them.</verse>
				<verse number="19">What I impart has greater worth than gold and treasure, and the increase I bring benefits more than a windfall of income.</verse>
				<verse number="20">I lead you into the ways of righteousness to discover the paths of true justice.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Those who love me gain great wealth and a glorious inheritance, and I will fill their lives with treasures.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">“In the beginning I was there, for God possessed me even before he created the universe.</verse>
				<verse number="23">From eternity past I was set in place, before the world began. I was anointed from the beginning.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Before the oceans depths were poured out, and before there were any glorious fountains overflowing with water, I was there, dancing!</verse>

				<verse number="30">I was there, close to the Creator’s side as his master artist. Daily he was filled with delight in me as I playfully rejoiced before him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">I laughed and played, so happy with what he had made, while finding my delight in the children of men.”</verse>

				<verse number="33">Listen to my counsel, for my instruction will enlighten you. You’ll be wise not to ignore it.</verse>
				<verse number="34">If you wait at wisdom’s doorway, longing to hear a word for every day, joy will break forth within you as you listen for what I’ll say.</verse>
				<verse number="35">For the fountain of life pours into you every time that you find me, and this is the secret of growing in the delight and the favor of the Lord.</verse>

				<verse number="1">Guilty criminals experience paranoia even though no one threatens them. But the innocent lovers of God, because of righteousness, will have the boldness of a young, ferocious lion!</verse>
				<verse number="2">A rebellious nation is thrown into chaos, but leaders anointed with wisdom will restore law and order.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When a pauper oppresses the destitute, it’s like a flash flood that sweeps away their last hope.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Those who turn their backs on what they know is right will no longer be able to tell right from wrong. But those who love the truth strengthen their souls.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Justice never makes sense to men devoted to darkness, but those tenderly devoted to the Lord can understand justice perfectly.</verse>
				<verse number="6">It’s more respectable to be poor and pure than rich and perverse.</verse>
				<verse number="7">To be obedient to what you’ve been taught proves you’re an honorable child, but to socialize with the lawless brings shame to your parents.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Go ahead and get rich on the backs of the poor, but all the wealth you gather will one day be given to those who are kind to the needy.</verse>
				<verse number="9">If you close your heart and refuse to listen to God’s instruction, even your prayer will be despised.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Those who tempt the lovers of God with an evil scheme will fall into their own traps. But the innocent who resist temptation will experience reward.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The wealthy in their conceit presume to be wise, but a poor person with discernment can see right through them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The triumphant joy of God’s lovers releases great glory. But when the wicked rise to power, everyone goes into hiding.</verse>

				<verse number="14">Overjoyed is the one who with tender heart trembles before God, but the stubborn, unyielding heart will experience even greater evil.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Ruthless rulers can only be compared to raging lions and roaming bears.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Abusive leaders fail to employ wisdom, but leaders who despise corruption will enjoy a long and full life.</verse>
				<verse number="17">A murderer’s conscience will torment him— a fugitive haunted by guilt all the way to the grave with no one to support him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The pure will be rescued from failure, but the perverse will suddenly fall into ruin.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Work hard and you’ll have all you desire, but chase a fantasy and you could end up with nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Life’s blessings drench the honest and faithful person, but punishment rains down upon the greedy and dishonest.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Giving favoritism to the rich and powerful is disgusting, and this is done by the type of judge who would betray a man for a bribe.</verse>
				<verse number="22">A greedy man is in a race to get rich, but he forgets that he could lose what’s most important and end up with nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="23">If you correct someone with constructive criticism, in the end he will appreciate it more than flattery.</verse>
				<verse number="24">A person who would reject his own parents and say, “What’s wrong with that?” is as bad as a murderer.</verse>
				<verse number="25">To make rash, hasty decisions shows that you are not trusting the Lord. But when you rely totally on God, you will still act carefully and prudently.</verse>

				<verse number="6">The wicked always have a trap laid for others, but the lovers of God escape as they sing and shout in joyous triumph!</verse>
				<verse number="7">God’s righteous people will pour themselves out for the poor, but the ungodly make no attempt to understand or help the needy.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Arrogant cynics love to pick fights, but the humble and wise love to pursue peace.</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="30">
				<verse number="1">These are the collected sayings of the prophet Agur, Jakeh’s son — the amazing revelation he imparted to Ithiel and Ukal.</verse>
				<verse number="2">God, I’m so weary and worn out, I feel more like a beast than a man. I was made in your image, but I lack understanding.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I’ve yet to learn the wisdom that comes from the full and intimate knowledge of you, the Holy One.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Who is it that travels back and forth from the heavenly realm to the earth? Who controls the wind as it blows and holds it in his fists? Who tucks the rain into the cloak of his clouds? Who stretches out the skyline from one vista to the other? What is his name? And what is the name of his Son? Who can tell me?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Every promise from the faithful God is pure and proves to be true. He is a wraparound shield of protection for all his lovers who run to hide in him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Never add to his words, or he will have to rebuke you and prove that you’re a liar.</verse>
				<verse number="7">God, there are two things I’m asking you for before I die, only two:</verse>
				<verse number="8">Empty out of my heart everything that is false— every lie, and every crooked thing. And give me neither undue poverty nor undue wealth— but rather, feed my soul with the measure of prosperity that pleases you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">May my satisfaction be found in you. Don’t let me be so rich that I don’t need you or so poor that I have to resort to dishonesty just to make ends meet. Then my life will never detract from bringing glory to your name.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Never defame a servant before his master, for you will be the guilty one and a curse will come upon you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">There is a generation rising that curses their fathers and speaks evil of their mothers.</verse>
				<verse number="12">There is a generation rising that considers themselves to be pure in their own eyes, yet they are morally filthy, unwashed, and unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="13">There is a generation rising that is so filled with pride, they think they are superior and look down on others.</verse>
				<verse number="14">There is a generation rising that uses their words like swords to cut and slash those who are different. They would devour the poor, the needy, and the afflicted from off the face of the earth!</verse>
				<verse number="15">There are three words to describe the greedy: “Give me more!” There are some things that are never satisfied. Forever craving more, they’re unable to say, “That’s enough!” Here are four:</verse>
				<verse number="16">the grave, yawning for another victim, the barren womb, ever wanting a child, thirsty soil, ever longing for rain, and a raging fire, devouring its fuel. They’re all insatiable.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The eye that mocks his father and dishonors his elderly mother deserves to be plucked out by the ravens of the valley and fed to the young vultures!</verse>
				<verse number="18">There are four marvelous mysteries that are too amazing to unravel — who could fully explain them?</verse>
				<verse number="19">The way an eagle flies in the sky, the way a snake glides on a boulder, the path of a ship as it passes through the sea, and the way a bridegroom falls in love with his bride.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Here is the deceptive way of the adulterous woman: she takes what she wants and then says, “I’ve done nothing wrong.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">There are four intolerable events that are simply unbearable to observe:</verse>
				<verse number="22">when an unfaithful servant becomes a ruler, when a scoundrel comes into great wealth,</verse>
				<verse number="23">when an unfaithful woman marries a good man, and when a mistress replaces a faithful wife.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The earth has four creatures that are very small but very wise:</verse>
				<verse number="25">The feeble ant has little strength, yet look how it diligently gathers its food in the summer to last throughout the winter.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The delicate rock-badger isn’t all that strong, yet look how it makes a secure home, nestled in the rocks.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The locusts have no king to lead them, yet they cooperate as they move forward by bands.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And the small lizard is easy to catch as it clings to the walls with its hands, yet it can be found inside a king’s palace.</verse>
				<verse number="29">There are four stately monarchs who are impressive to watch as they go forth:</verse>
				<verse number="30">the lion, the king of the jungle, who is afraid of no one,</verse>
				<verse number="31">the rooster strutting boldly among the hens, the male goat out in front leading the herd, and a king leading his regal procession.</verse>
				<verse number="32">If you’ve acted foolishly by drawing attention to yourself, or if you’ve thought about saying something stupid, you’d better shut your mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="33">For such stupidity may give you a bloody nose! Stirring up an argument only leads to an angry confrontation.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="31">
				<verse number="1">King Lemuel’s royal words of wisdom: These are the inspired words my mother taught me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Listen, my dear son, son of my womb. You are the answer to my prayers, my son.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So keep yourself sexually pure from the promiscuous, wayward woman. Don’t waste the strength of your anointing on those who ruin kings— you’ll live to regret it!</verse>
				<verse number="4">For you are a king, Lemuel, and it’s never fitting for a king to be drunk on wine or for rulers to crave alcohol.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For when they drink they forget justice and ignore the rights of those in need, those who depend on them for leadership.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Strong drink is given to the terminally ill, who are suffering at the brink of death. Wine is for those in depression in order to drown their sorrows. Let them drink and forget their poverty and misery.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">But you are to be a king who speaks up on behalf of the disenfranchised and pleads for the legal rights of the defenseless and those who are dying.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Be a righteous king, judging on behalf of the poor and interceding for those most in need.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Who could ever find a wife like this one — she is a woman of strength and mighty valor! She’s full of wealth and wisdom. The price paid for her was greater than many jewels.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Her husband has entrusted his heart to her, for she brings him the rich spoils of victory.</verse>
				<verse number="12">All throughout her life she brings him what is good and not evil.</verse>
				<verse number="13">She searches out continually to possess that which is pure and righteous. She delights in the work of her hands.</verse>
				<verse number="14">She gives out revelation-truth to feed others. She is like a trading ship bringing divine supplies from the merchant.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Even in the night season she arises and sets food on the table for hungry ones in her house and for others.</verse>
				<verse number="16">She sets her heart upon a field and takes it as her own. She labors there to plant the living vines.</verse>
				<verse number="17">She wraps herself in strength, might, and power in all her works.</verse>
				<verse number="18">She tastes and experiences a better substance, and her shining light will not be extinguished, no matter how dark the night.</verse>
				<verse number="19">She stretches out her hands to help the needy and she lays hold of the wheels of government.</verse>
				<verse number="20">She is known by her extravagant generosity to the poor, for she always reaches out her hands to those in need.</verse>
				<verse number="21">She is not afraid of tribulation, for all her household is covered in the dual garments of righteousness and grace.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Her clothing is beautifully knit together — a purple gown of exquisite linen.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Her husband is famous and admired by all, sitting as the venerable judge of his people.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Even her works of righteousness she does for the benefit of her enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Bold power and glorious majesty are wrapped around her as she laughs with joy over the latter days.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Her teachings are filled with wisdom and kindness as loving instruction pours from her lips.</verse>
				<verse number="27">She watches over the ways of her household and meets every need they have.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Her sons and daughters arise in one accord to extol her virtues, and her husband arises to speak of her in glowing terms.</verse>
				<verse number="29">“There are many valiant and noble ones, but you have ascended above them all!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Charm can be misleading, and beauty is vain and so quickly fades, but this virtuous woman lives in the wonder, awe, and fear of the Lord. She will be praised throughout eternity.</verse>
				<verse number="31">So go ahead and give her the credit that is due, for she has become a radiant woman, and all her loving works of righteousness deserve to be admired at the gateways of every city!</verse>

				<verse number="1">The most amazing song of all, by King Solomon.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Let him smother me with kisses—his Spirit-kiss divine. So kind are your caresses, I drink them in like the sweetest wine!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Your presence releases a fragrance so pleasing— over and over poured out. For your lovely name is “Flowing Oil.” No wonder the brides-to-be adore you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Draw me into your heart. We will run away together into the king’s cloud-filled chamber. We will remember your love, rejoicing and delighting in you, celebrating your every kiss as better than wine. No wonder righteousness adores you!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Jerusalem maidens, in this twilight darkness I know I am so unworthy—so in need. Yet you are so lovely! I feel as dark and dry as the desert tents of the wandering nomads. Yet you are so lovely— like the fine linen tapestry hanging in the Holy Place.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Please don’t stare in scorn because of my dark and sinful ways. My angry brothers quarreled with me and appointed me guardian of their ministry vineyards, yet I’ve not tended my vineyard within.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Won’t you tell me, lover of my soul, where do you feed your flock? Where do you lead your beloved ones to rest in the heat of the day? Why should I be like a veiled woman as I wander among the flocks of your shepherds?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Listen, my radiant one— if you ever lose sight of me, just follow in my footsteps where I lead my lovers. Come with your burdens and cares. Come to the place near the sanctuary of my shepherds.</verse>
				<verse number="9">My dearest one, let me tell you how I see you— you are so thrilling to me. To gaze upon you is like looking at one of Pharaoh’s finest horses — a strong, regal steed pulling his royal chariot.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Your tender cheeks are beautiful — your earrings and gem-laden necklaces set them ablaze.</verse>
				<verse number="11">We will enhance your beauty, with golden ornaments studded with silver.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As the king surrounded me at his table, the sweet fragrance of spikenard awakened the night.</verse>
				<verse number="13">A sachet of myrrh is my lover, like a tied-up bundle of myrrh resting over my heart.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He is like a bouquet of henna blossoms— henna plucked near the vines at the fountain of the Lamb. I will hold him and never let him part.</verse>
				<verse number="15">My darling, you are so lovely! You are beauty itself to me. Your passionate eyes are like gentle doves.</verse>
				<verse number="16">My beloved one, both handsome and winsome, you are pleasing beyond words. Our resting place is anointed and flourishing, like a green forest meadow bathed in light.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Rafters of cedar branches are over our heads and balconies of pleasant-smelling pines.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">I am truly his rose, the very theme of his song. I’m overshadowed by his love, like a lily growing in the valley!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yes, you are my darling companion. You stand out from all the rest. For though the thorns surround you, you remain as pure as a lily, more than all others.</verse>
				<verse number="3">My beloved is to me the most fragrant apple tree— he stands above the sons of men. Sitting under his grace-shadow, I blossom in his shade, enjoying the sweet taste of his pleasant, delicious fruit, resting with delight where his glory never fades.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Suddenly, he transported me into his house of wine— he looked upon me with his unrelenting love divine.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Revive me with your raisin cakes. Refresh me again with your apples. Help me and hold me, for I am lovesick! I am longing for more— yet how could I take more?</verse>
				<verse number="6">His left hand cradles my head while his right hand holds me close. I am at rest in this love.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Promise me, Jerusalem maidens, by the gentle gazelles and delicate deer, that you’ll not disturb my love until she is ready to arise.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Listen! I hear my lover’s voice. I know it’s him coming to me— leaping with joy over mountains, skipping in love over the hills that separate us, to come to me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Let me describe him: he is graceful as a gazelle, swift as a wild stag. Now he comes closer, even to the places where I hide. He gazes into my soul, peering through the portal as he blossoms within my heart.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The one I love calls to me: Arise, my dearest. Hurry, my darling. Come away with me! I have come as you have asked to draw you to my heart and lead you out. For now is the time, my beautiful one.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The season has changed, the bondage of your barren winter has ended, and the season of hiding is over and gone. The rains have soaked the earth</verse>
				<verse number="12">and left it bright with blossoming flowers. The season for singing and pruning the vines has arrived. I hear the cooing of doves in our land, filling the air with songs to awaken you and guide you forth.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Can you not discern this new day of destiny breaking forth around you? The early signs of my purposes and plans are bursting forth. The budding vines of new life are now blooming everywhere. The fragrance of their flowers whispers, “There is change in the air.” Arise, my love, my beautiful companion, and run with me to the higher place. For now is the time to arise and come away with me.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For you are my dove, hidden in the split-open rock. It was I who took you and hid you up high in the secret stairway of the sky. Let me see your radiant face and hear your sweet voice. How beautiful your eyes of worship and lovely your voice in prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You must catch the troubling foxes, those sly little foxes that hinder our relationship. For they raid our budding vineyard of love to ruin what I’ve planted within you. Will you catch them and remove them for me? We will do it together.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I know my lover is mine and I have everything in you, for we delight ourselves in each other.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But until the day springs to life and the shifting shadows of fear disappear, turn around, my lover, and ascend to the holy mountains of separation without me. Until the new day fully dawns, run on ahead like the graceful gazelle and skip like the young stag over the mountains of separation. Go on ahead to the mountain of spices— I’ll come away another time.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Night after night I’m tossing and turning on my bed of travail. Why did I let him go from me? How my heart now aches for him, but he is nowhere to be found!</verse>
				<verse number="2">So I must rise in search of him, looking throughout the city, seeking until I find him. Even if I have to roam through every street, nothing will keep me from my search. Where is he—my soul’s true love? He is nowhere to be found.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then I encountered the overseers as they encircled the city. So I asked them, “Have you found him— my heart’s true love?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Just as I moved past them, I encountered him. I found the one I adore! I caught him and fastened myself to him, refusing to be feeble in my heart again. Now I’ll bring him back to the temple within where I was given new birth— into my innermost parts, the place of my conceiving.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Promise me, O Jerusalem maidens, by the gentle gazelles and delicate deer, that you’ll not disturb my love until she is ready to arise.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Who is this one ascending from the wilderness in the pillar of the glory cloud? He is fragrant with the anointing oils of myrrh and frankincense — more fragrant than all the spices of the merchant.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Look! It is the king’s marriage carriage— the love seat surrounded by sixty champions, the mightiest of Israel’s host, are like pillars of protection.</verse>
				<verse number="8">They stand ready with swords to defend the king and his fiancée from every terror of the night.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The king made this mercy seat for himself out of the finest wood that will not decay.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Pillars of smoke, like silver mist— a canopy of golden glory dwells above it. The place where they sit together is sprinkled with crimson. Love and mercy cover this carriage, blanketing his tabernacle throne. The king himself has made it for those who will become his bride.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Rise up, Zion maidens, brides-to-be! Come and feast your eyes on this king as he passes in procession on his way to his wedding. This is the day filled with overwhelming joy— the day of his great gladness.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Listen, my dearest darling, you are so beautiful—you are beauty itself to me! Your eyes are like gentle doves behind your veil. What devotion I see each time I gaze upon you. You are like a sacrifice ready to be offered.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When I look at you, I see how you have taken my fruit and tasted my word. Your life has become clean and pure, like a lamb washed and newly shorn. You now show grace and balance with truth on display.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Your lips are as lovely as Rahab’s scarlet ribbon, speaking mercy, speaking grace. The words of your mouth are as refreshing as an oasis. What pleasure you bring to me! I see your blushing cheeks opened like the halves of a pomegranate, showing through your veil of tender meekness.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When I look at you, I see your inner strength, so stately and strong. You are as secure as David’s fortress. Your virtues and grace cause a thousand famous soldiers to surrender to your beauty.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Your pure faith and love rest over your heart as you nurture those who are yet infants.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I’ve made up my mind. Until the darkness disappears and the dawn has fully come, in spite of shadows and fears, I will go to the mountaintop with you— the mountain of suffering love and the hill of burning incense. Yes, I will be your bride.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Every part of you is so beautiful, my darling. Perfect is your beauty, without flaw within.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now you are ready, my bride, to come with me as we climb the highest peaks together. Come with me through the archway of trust. We will look down from the crest of the glistening mounts and from the summit of our sublime sanctuary, from the lion’s den and the leopard’s lair.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For you reach into my heart. With one flash of your eyes I am undone by your love, my beloved, my equal, my bride. You leave me breathless— I am overcome by merely a glance from your worshiping eyes, for you have stolen my heart. I am held hostage by your love and by the graces of righteousness shining upon you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">How satisfying to me, my equal, my bride. Your love is my finest wine—intoxicating and thrilling. And your sweet, perfumed praises—so exotic, so pleasing.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Your loving words are like the honeycomb to me; your tongue releases milk and honey, for I find the promised land flowing within you. The fragrance of your worshiping love surrounds you with scented robes of white.</verse>
				<verse number="12">My darling bride, my private paradise, fastened to my heart. A secret spring that no one else can have are you— my bubbling fountain hidden from public view. What a perfect partner to me now that I have you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Your inward life is now sprouting, bringing forth fruit. What a beautiful paradise unfolds within you. When I’m near you, I smell aromas of the finest spice, for many clusters of my exquisite fruit now grow within your inner garden. Here are the nine: pomegranates of passion, henna from heaven, spikenard so sweet, saffron shining, fragrant calamus from the cross, sacred cinnamon, branches of scented woods, myrrh, like tears from a tree, and aloe as eagles ascending.</verse>
				<verse number="14"></verse>
				<verse number="15">You are a fountain of gardens. A well of living water springs up from within you, like a mountain brook flowing into my heart!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Awake, O north wind! Awake, O south wind! Breathe on my garden with your Spirit-Wind. Stir up the sweet spice of your life within me. Spare nothing as you make me your fruitful garden. Hold nothing back until I release your fragrance. Come walk with me as you walked with Adam in your paradise garden. Come taste the fruits of your life in me.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">I have gathered from your heart, my equal, my bride, I have gathered from my garden all my sacred spices—even my myrrh. I have tasted and enjoyed my wine within you. I have tasted with pleasure my pure milk, my honeycomb, which you yield to me. I delight in gathering my sacred spice, all the fruits of my life I have gathered from within you, my paradise garden. Come, all my friends— feast upon my bride, all you revelers of my palace. Feast on her, my lovers! Drink and drink, and drink again, until you can take no more. Drink the wine of her love. Take all you desire, you priests. My life within her will become your feast.</verse>
				<verse number="2">After this I let my devotion slumber, but my heart for him stayed awake. I had a dream. I dreamed of my beloved— he was coming to me in the darkness of night. The melody of the man I love awakened me. I heard his knock at my heart’s door as he pleaded with me: Arise, my love. Open your heart, my darling, deeper still to me. Will you receive me this dark night? There is no one else but you, my friend, my equal. I need you this night to arise and come be with me. You are my pure, loyal dove, a perfect partner for me. My flawless one, will you arise? For my heaviness and tears are more than I can bear. I have spent myself for you throughout the dark night.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I have already laid aside my own garments for you. How could I take them up again since I’ve yielded my righteousness to yours? You have cleansed my life and taken me so far. Isn’t that enough?</verse>
				<verse number="4">My beloved reached into me to unlock my heart. The core of my very being trembled at his touch. How my soul melted when he spoke to me!</verse>
				<verse number="5">My spirit arose to open for more of his touch. As I surrendered to him, I began to sense his fragrance— the fragrance of his suffering love! It was the sense of myrrh flowing all through me!</verse>
				<verse number="6">I opened my soul to my beloved, but suddenly he was gone! And my heart was torn out in longing for him. I sought his presence, his fragrance, but could not find him anywhere. I called out for him, yet he did not answer me. I will arise and search for him until I find him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">As I walked throughout the city in search of him, the overseers stopped me as they made their rounds. They beat me and bruised me until I could take no more. They wounded me deeply and removed my covering from me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Nevertheless, make me this promise, you brides-to-be: if you find my beloved one, please tell him I endured all travails for him. I’ve been pierced through by love, and I will not be turned aside!</verse>
				<verse number="9">What love is this? How could you continue to care so deeply for him? Isn’t there another who could steal away your heart? We see now your beauty, more beautiful than all the others. What makes your beloved better than any other? What is it about him that makes you ask us to promise you this?</verse>
				<verse number="10">He alone is my beloved. He shines in dazzling splendor yet is still so approachable— without equal as he stands above all others, outstanding among ten thousand!</verse>
				<verse number="11">The way he leads me is divine. His leadership—so pure and dignified as he wears his crown of gold. Upon this crown are letters of black written on a background of glory.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He sees everything with pure understanding. How beautiful his insights—without distortion. His eyes rest upon the fullness of the river of revelation, flowing so clean and pure.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Looking at his gentle face, I see such fullness of emotion. Like a lovely garden where fragrant spices grow — what a man! No one speaks words so anointed as this one — words that both pierce and heal, words like lilies dripping with myrrh.</verse>
				<verse number="14">See how his hands hold unlimited power! But he never uses it in anger, for he is always holy, displaying his glory. His innermost place is a work of art— so beautiful and bright. How magnificent and noble is this one— covered in majesty!</verse>
				<verse number="15">He’s steadfast in all he does. His ways are the ways of righteousness, based on truth and holiness. None can rival him, but all will be amazed by him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Most sweet are his kisses, even his whispers of love. He is delightful in every way and perfect from every viewpoint. If you ask me why I love him so, O brides-to-be, it’s because there is none like him to me. Everything about him fills me with holy desire! And now he is my beloved—my friend forever.</verse>

			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">O rarest of beauty, where then has your lover gone? We long to see him too. Where may we find him? We will follow you as you seek after him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">My lover has gone down into his garden of delight, to the flowerbeds of spices to feast with those pure in heart.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I am fully devoted to my beloved, and my beloved is fully devoted to me.</verse>
				<verse number="4">O my beloved, you are lovely. When I see you in your beauty, I see a radiant city where we will dwell as one. More pleasing than any pleasure, more delightful than any delight, you have ravished my heart, stealing away my strength to resist you. Even hosts of angels stand in awe of you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Turn your eyes from me; I can’t take it anymore! I can’t resist the passion of these eyes that I adore. Overpowered by a glance, my ravished heart—undone. Held captive by your love, I am truly overcome! For your undying devotion to me is the most yielded sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The shining of your spirit shows how you have taken my truth to become balanced and complete.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Your beautiful blushing cheeks reveal how real your passion is for me, even hidden behind your veil of humility.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I could have chosen any from among the vast multitude of royal ones who follow me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But unique is my beloved dove—unrivaled in beauty, without equal, beyond compare, the perfect one, the favorite one. Others see your beauty and sing of your joy. Brides and queens chant your praise: “How blessed is she!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Look at you now— arising as the dayspring of the dawn, fair as the shining moon, bright and brilliant as the sun in all its strength— astonishing to behold as a majestic army waving banners of victory.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I decided to go down to the valley streams where the orchards of the king grow and mature. I longed to know if hearts were opening. Are the budding vines blooming with new growth? Has their springtime of passionate love arrived?</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then suddenly my longings transported me. My divine desire brought me next to my beloved prince, sitting with him in his royal chariot. We were lifted up together!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Come back! Return to us, O maiden of his majesty. Dance for us as we gaze upon your beauty. Why would you seek a mere Shulamite like me? Why would you want to see my dance of love? Because you dance so gracefully, as though you danced with angels!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">How beautiful on the mountains are the sandaled feet of this one bringing such good news. You are truly royalty! The way you walk so gracefully in my ways displays such dignity. You are truly the poetry of God—his very handiwork.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Out of your innermost being is flowing the fullness of my Spirit— never failing to satisfy. Within your womb there is a birthing of harvest wheat; they are the sons and daughters nurtured by the purity you impart. How gracious you have become!</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">Your life stands tall as a tower, like a shining light on a hill. Your revelation eyes are pure, like pools of refreshing — sparkling light for a multitude. Such discernment surrounds you, protecting you from the enemy’s advance.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Redeeming love crowns you as royalty. Your thoughts are full of life, wisdom, and virtue. Even a king is held captive by your beauty.</verse>
				<verse number="6">How delicious is your fair beauty; it cannot be described as I count the delights you bring to me. Love has become the greatest.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You stand in victory above the rest, stately and secure as you share with me your vineyard of love.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now I decree, I will ascend my palm tree. I will take hold of you with my power, possessing every part of my fruitful bride. Your love I will drink as wine, and your words will be mine.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For your kisses of love are exhilarating, more than any delight I’ve known before. Your kisses of love awaken even the lips of sleeping ones.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now I know that I am for my beloved and all his desires are fulfilled in me.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Come away, my lover. Come with me to the faraway fields. We will run away together to the forgotten places and show them redeeming love.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Let us arise and run to the vineyards of your people and see if the budding vines of love are now in full bloom. We will discover if their passion is awakened. There I will display my love for you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The love apples are in bloom, sending forth their fragrance of spring. The rarest of fruits are found at our doors— the new as well as the old. I have stored them for you, my lover-friend!</verse>

			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">If only I could show everyone this passionate desire I have for you. If only I could express it fully, no matter who was watching me, without shame or embarrassment.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I long to bring you to my innermost chamber— this holy sanctuary you have formed within me. O that I might carry you within me! I would give you the spiced wine of my love, this full cup of bliss that we share. We would drink our fill until . . .</verse>
				<verse number="3">His left hand cradles my head while his right hand holds me close. We are at rest in this love.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Promise me, brides-to-be, by the gentle gazelles and delicate deer, that you’ll not disturb my love until he is ready to arise.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Who is this one? She arises out of her desert, clinging to her beloved. When I awakened you under the apple tree, as you were feasting upon me, I awakened your innermost being with the travail of birth as you longed for more of me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Fasten me upon your heart as a seal of fire forevermore. This living, consuming flame will seal you as my prisoner of love. My passion is stronger than the chains of death and the grave, all consuming as the very flashes of fire from the burning heart of God. Place this fierce, unrelenting fire over your entire being.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Rivers of pain and persecution will never extinguish this flame. Endless floods will be unable to quench this raging fire that burns within you. Everything will be consumed. It will stop at nothing as you yield everything to this furious fire until it won’t even seem to you like a sacrifice anymore.</verse>
				<verse number="8">My brothers said to me when I was young, “Our sister is so immature. What will we do to guard her for her wedding day?” We will build a tower of redemption to protect her. Since she is vulnerable, we will enclose her with a wall of cedar boards. But now I have grown and become a bride, and my love for him has made me a tower of passion and contentment for my beloved. I am now a firm wall of protection for others, guarding them from harm. This is how he sees me—I am the one who brings him bliss, finding favor in his eyes.</verse>

				<verse number="11">My bridegroom-king has a vineyard of love made from a multitude of followers. His caretakers of this vineyard have given my beloved their best.</verse>

				<verse number="13">My beloved, one with me in my garden, how marvelous that my friends, the brides-to-be, now hear your voice and song. Let me now hear it again.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Arise, my darling! Come quickly, my beloved. Come and be the graceful gazelle with me. Come be like a young stag with me. We will dance in the high place of the sky, yes, on the mountains of fragrant spice. Forever we shall be united as one!</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">Here is the vision that Isaiah, the son of Amoz, received by divine revelation concerning what was going to happen to Judah and Jerusalem during the times of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Listen, O heavens! Hear, O earth! For the Lord Yahweh has spoken: “I tenderly nurtured children and made them great, but they have rebelled against me!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Even a dumb ox instinctively knows its owner and the stubborn mule knows the hand that feeds it, but Israel does not know me nor do my people understand.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Oh, how this nation keeps sinning! See them dragging the heavy burden of their guilt! They are corrupt children, descendants of evildoers. They have turned their backs on the Lord God and despised the Holy One of Israel! They have cut themselves off from the help of God!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Why would you seek to be injured further? Why would you stubbornly continue in your rebellion? Your whole head is sick, and your heart and your will are weak and faint.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You are corrupt from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head. There is no integrity — nothing but bruises, putrefying sores, and raw open wounds! They have not been drained or bandaged or soothed with oil.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Your country is devastated and your cities burned to the ground; foreigners plunder your crops before your eyes— with nothing but devastation and destruction in their wake!</verse>
				<verse number="8">And the daughter of Zion is left as helpless as a deserted shack in a vineyard or a flimsy shelter in a field of cucumbers— in every way like a city besieged!</verse>
				<verse number="9">If the Lord of Angel Armies had not left us survivors, our fate would have been the same as Sodom and Gomorrah!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Hear the word of Yahweh: “You leaders of Sodom, heed the correction of our God! People of Gomorrah, you’d better listen to his rebuke.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">And Yahweh keeps saying: “Why such countless sacrifices—what use are they to me? I’ve had my fill of your burnt offerings of rams and your fattened animals. I find no delight in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats!</verse>
				<verse number="12">When you come before my face, who asked you to come trampling on my courtyards?</verse>
				<verse number="13">Stop bringing your meaningless offerings. Your burning incense stinks! Your sin-stained celebrations, your new moon festivals, Sabbaths, your various pious meetings—I can’t stand them!</verse>
				<verse number="14">With all my soul I hate your new moon festivals and your feasts; they are nothing but a burden that I’m sick and tired of carrying.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When you stretch out your hands to pray, I will hide my eyes from you. Repeat your prayers all you want, but I will not listen, for your hands are stained with innocent blood.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Wash yourselves and make yourselves clean. Remove your evil actions from my sight and stop sinning!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Learn what it means to do what is good by seeking righteousness and justice! Rescue the oppressed. Uphold the rights of the fatherless and defend the widow’s cause.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Come now and let’s deliberate over the next steps to take together.” Yahweh promises you over and over: “Though your sins stain you like scarlet, I will whiten them like bright, new-fallen snow! Even though they are deep red like crimson, they will be made white like wool!</verse>
				<verse number="19">If you have a willing heart to let me help you, and if you will obey me, you will feast on the blessings of an abundant harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But if you are stubborn and refuse to obey, the sword will eat you instead.” The mouth of Yahweh has spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Look how the once faithful city has become as unfaithful as a prostitute! She who was once the “Center of Justice,” where righteousness made its home, is now the dwelling place of murderers!</verse>
				<verse number="22">She was once like sterling silver, now only mixture; once so pure, now diluted like watered-down wine.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Your rulers are rebellious and companions of crooks. They are self-centered racketeers who love a bribe and who chase after payoffs. They don’t defend the fatherless or consider the rights of a helpless widow.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Therefore, here is what the Sovereign One, the Lord God of Angel Armies, the Mighty One of Israel, decrees: “Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries and avenge myself on my foes!</verse>
				<verse number="25">I will put my fiery hand upon you and purify you with fire into something clean.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">“I will restore deliverers as in former times and your wise counselors as at the beginning. Only then will you be called the Righteous City and the Faithful City!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Yes, Zion will be redeemed with justice and her repentant converts with righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="28">There will be a shattering of rebels and sinners together, and those who forsake the Lord will be consumed.</verse>
				<verse number="29">You will reap shame from the idols you once delighted in and you will be humiliated by your cultic sacred groves, where you chose to worship.</verse>
				<verse number="30">You will be like an oak tree with faded, fallen leaves and like a withered, waterless garden.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The “powerful elite” will become like kindling and their evil deeds like sparks—both will burn together and no one will be able to put out the fire.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">This is the word revealed to Isaiah, son of Amoz, concerning Judah and Jerusalem:</verse>
				<verse number="2">In the last days, the mountain of Yahweh ’s temple will be raised up as the head of the mountains, towering over all the hills. A sparkling stream of every nation will flow into it.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Many peoples will come and say, “Everyone, come! Let’s go up higher to Yahweh ’s mountain, to the house of Jacob’s God; then he can teach us his ways and we can walk in his paths!” Zion will be the center of instruction, and the word of Yahweh will go out from Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He will judge fairly between the nations and settle disputes among many peoples. They will beat the swords they used against each other into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. No nation will take up weapons against another, nor will they prepare for war anymore.</verse>
				<verse number="5">O house of Jacob, come let us walk in the wonderful light of Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Lord, you have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob, for they are full of occultic secrets from the east, like the land of the Philistines, with sorcerers everywhere; they are pleased with what is false and foreign.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Their land overflows with gold and silver; they are wealthy beyond measure. Their land is filled with horses and innumerable chariots!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Worthless idols are everywhere, and they worship the work of their own hands, what their fingers have made.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The people bow down low before the “no-gods,” and the leaders lie down flat before them in worship, so do not spare them!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Enter into the rock and hide in the dust from the dreadful presence of Yahweh and from his majestic glory.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The arrogant will be humbled and the pride of man brought low. Only one will be exalted in that day: Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="12">The Lord of Angel Armies has a day of humiliation in store for all the high and mighty, for all who are proud and self-exalting. They will be brought low.</verse>
				<verse number="13">His judgment is coming against all the lofty cedars of Lebanon and all the oaks of Bashan,</verse>
				<verse number="14">against all the high mountains and all the lofty hills,</verse>
				<verse number="15">against every high tower and every fortress wall,</verse>
				<verse number="16">against all the trading ships of Tarshish and all the impressive sailing vessels.</verse>
				<verse number="17">People’s arrogance will be conquered and brought low, and those proud of heart will be humiliated. Only one will be exalted in that day: Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Every worthless idol will utterly pass away.</verse>
				<verse number="19">People will hide in caves and holes in the ground from the dreadful presence of Yahweh and from his majestic glory when he rises to mightily shake the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="20">In that day, people will throw away the worthless idols their hands have made from gold and silver. They will fling their treasures to the rodents and bats</verse>
				<verse number="21">as they crawl into the clefts of the rock to hide from the dreadful presence of Yahweh and from the majesty of his glory when he rises to shake the earth mightily!</verse>
				<verse number="22">So once and for all, stop trusting in man, who is but one breath from death —frail and puny man!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Behold— Yahweh, the Sovereign One, the Commander of Angel Armies, is about to cut off from Jerusalem and Judah every source of their support and security, including all food supplies and water.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He will remove their heroes and soldiers, prophets and judges, their psychics and statesmen,</verse>
				<verse number="3">their respected military leaders, pillars of the community, their counselors, skilled craftsmen, and those professional charmers.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I will make inexperienced youth their rulers, and children will govern them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Everyone will take advantage of everyone else, and neighbor will struggle against neighbor. The youth will not respect their elders, and the dishonorable will sneer at those worthy of honor.</verse>
				<verse number="6">One man will even seize a relative right in his father’s house and say, “ At least you own a coat; you be our leader! You can oversee this heap of ruins!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">In that day he will cry out, “I have no remedy for this mess! I don’t have any food or clothes either, so don’t make me your leader!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen because their words and their works are defiant before the face of the Lord’s glorious presence.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The look on their impudent faces says it all, for they publicly flaunt their sin like Sodom, not even trying to hide it. Woe to their souls, for they invite disaster upon themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yet reassure the righteous; it will go well with them! They will fully enjoy the reward of their deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But woe to the guilty, for they will get fully what they deserve!</verse>
				<verse number="12">My people, mockers exploit you and creditors rule over you. My people, your leaders mislead you and confuse you with their guidance.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh is taking his rightful place in court; he is rising to judge his people.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yahweh comes to issue the guilty verdict of the elders and leaders of his people, saying: “You are the ones who have ruined the nation! Your houses are full of what you’ve stolen from the poor!</verse>
				<verse number="15">What gives you the right to crush my people by shoving the faces of the poor into the dirt?” Yahweh, the Sovereign One, Commander of Angel Armies, has spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Here is what Yahweh says: “The daughters of Zion are proud, walking about arrogantly with their noses in the air. Their eyes are seductive as they skip along with jewelry jingling on their ankles.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So the Lord will afflict the foreheads of the daughters of Zion with scabs; Yahweh will make the front of their heads bald in that day.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">In that day, the Lord will strip away their vanity — their beautiful ankle jewelry, necklaces, crescent pendants, earrings, bracelets, and veils of shimmering gauze.</verse>
				<verse number="19"></verse>
				<verse number="20">Gone will be their elaborate headdresses and ankle chains, their sashes, sachets, and charms.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He will snatch away their signet rings and nose rings,</verse>
				<verse number="22">their stately gowns, capes, shawls, cloaks, and purses,</verse>
				<verse number="23">hand mirrors, fine linen garments interwoven with gold and purple, turbans, and long veils.</verse>
				<verse number="24">A stench will take the place of seductive perfumes; a rope will take the place of a sash, baldness for braided hair, rags instead of a fine robe, and the brand of a captive instead of beauty.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Your men will fall on the battlefield and your heroes will die in war.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Cries of mourning will be heard at the city gates; with the anguish of such great loss, she will sit down and grieve in the dirt.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Seven women will take hold of one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own food and wear our own clothing; just take away our disgrace and let us be called by your name.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">In that day, the branch of Yahweh will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth will be the pride and glory of the remnant of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then the remnant in Zion and Jerusalem, those who are written for life in Jerusalem, will be called holy.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem by a Spirit of justice and by a Spirit of burning.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Yahweh will create over all of Mount Zion and over every gathering a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night. And all this manifestation of dazzling glory will spread over them like a wedding canopy.</verse>
				<verse number="6">It will be a tabernacle as a shade from the scorching heat of the day and a safe shelter to protect them from the storm and rain.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Let me sing a song for the one I love, called “My Lover and His Vineyard”: My beloved planted a vineyard on a very fertile hill.</verse>
				<verse number="2">First he dug up its ground and hauled away its stones so he could plant within it the choicest of vines. He built a watchtower in the middle of it and carved a winepress out of its rock. He fully expected it to bear good grapes, but instead it produced only worthless wild grapes.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So now, you residents of Jerusalem and people of Judah, you be the judges!</verse>
				<verse number="4">What more could I have done for my vineyard? When I expected it to bear luscious grapes, why did it produce only wild, worthless grapes?</verse>
				<verse number="5">So let me tell you what I am about to do to my vineyard. I will tear down its fence and it will be plundered. I will break down its wall and it will be destroyed!</verse>
				<verse number="6">I will make it a wasteland, and no one will cultivate the land. It will grow only weeds and thorns! I will command the clouds and they will not drop their rain upon it!</verse>
				<verse number="7">For Israel is this vineyard of Yahweh, the Commander of Angel Armies, and the people of Judah are the garden of his delight. When he waited for a crop of justice, he got a harvest of bloodshed! When he waited to reap fairness, he heard only the cries of victims.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Woe to those who, in their greed, buy up house after house to make one grand estate until there is no place for anyone else and only the landowner is left!</verse>
				<verse number="9">This is what Yahweh, the Commander of Angel Armies, said in my ears: “Truly, many of your houses will become devastated and your large, impressive mansions will have no one living in them!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Indeed, even a vast vineyard will produce only a few gallons of wine, and several bushels of seed will produce only a bushel of harvest!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Woe to those who start drinking early in the morning, lingering late into the night to get drunk with wine.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Their lavish parties are complete with the music of harps and flutes—and the wine flows! Yet they have no respect for what Yahweh has done, nor do they contemplate the work of his hands!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Therefore, my people go into exile for lack of understanding. Their leaders are starving, their multitudes parched with thirst.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The shadowy realm of death grows thirsty for souls and opens its mouth even wider to drink in the people! It gulps down the leaders of Jerusalem, along with their noisy, boasting crowds!</verse>
				<verse number="15">The people will be humiliated, all of humanity humbled, and the arrogant will be brought low.</verse>
				<verse number="16">With justice the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, displays his greatness, and righteousness sets him apart as the holy God.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then lambs will graze, as if in their own pastures, and the refugee will eat in the ruins of the rich.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Woe to those who drag behind them their guilt with ropes made of lies — straining and tugging, harnessed to their bondage!</verse>
				<verse number="19">They say, “May God hurry up and bring his judgment so that we can see it once and for all! Let the prophetic plan of the Holy One of Israel quickly come to pass so that we can see what it is!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who replace darkness with light and light with darkness, who replace bitter with sweet and sweet with bitter.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and see themselves as clever and shrewd.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Woe to the champion wine drinkers who are heroes in mixing strong drinks—</verse>
				<verse number="23">judges and politicians who acquit the guilty for a bribe and take away the rights of the innocent.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Therefore, just as tongues of fire lick up the straw and dry grass, they will be destroyed, just as a plant with decaying roots and blossoms dries up like dust and is blown away in the wind. For they said, “No!” to the teachings of Yahweh, the Lord of Angel Armies, and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="25">For this reason Yahweh ’s anger burned against his people, and he struck them down with his holy hand! The mountains trembled, and dead bodies were littered like garbage left in the streets. Even with this, his anger has not turned away and still his hand is heavy upon them!</verse>
				<verse number="26">He will lift up a banner to signal the distant nations; he whistles for them to come from the ends of the earth. Look! Here they come, running swiftly and speedily!</verse>
				<verse number="27">Not one warrior stumbles or grows weary— not even stopping to rest or sleep; they are battle ready!</verse>
				<verse number="28">Their arrows are sharpened and every bow strung. Their horses’ hooves are hard as flint and their chariot wheels turn like the whirlwind.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Their shout is like a lion’s roar, the roar of strong lions growling as they seize their prey. They carry away captives, and none can rescue them.</verse>
				<verse number="30">They will roar and roar on that day like the roaring of crashing waves, and if you look back across the land you’ll see only darkness, disaster, and distress; daylight itself will be obscured by thick clouds.</verse>

				<verse number="1">In the year that King Uzziah died, I clearly saw the Lord. He was seated on his exalted throne, towering high above me. His long, flowing robe of splendor spread throughout the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Standing above him were the angels of flaming fire, each with six wings: with two wings they covered their faces in reverence, with two wings they covered their feet, and with two wings they flew.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And one called out to another, saying: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, Commander of Angel Armies! The whole earth is filled with his glory!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">The thunderous voice of the fiery angels caused the foundations of the thresholds to tremble as the cloud of glory filled the temple!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then I stammered and said, “Woe is me! I’m destroyed —doomed as a sinful man! For my words are tainted and I live among people who talk the same way. King Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies—my eyes have gazed upon him!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then out of the smoke, one of the angels of fire flew to me. He had in his hands a burning coal he had taken from the altar with tongs.</verse>
				<verse number="7">He touched my lips with it and said, “See? The burning coal from the altar has touched your lips. Your guilt is taken away; your sin is blotted out.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then I heard the Lord saying, “Whom should I send to my people? Who will go to represent us?” I spoke up and said, “I will be the one. Send me.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then he said, “Go and tell the people: ‘You keep listening but understand nothing. You keep watching but learn nothing.’</verse>
				<verse number="10">Go and preach a message that will make their hearts dull, their ears plugged, and their eyes blind. Otherwise, their eyes will begin to see, their ears will begin to hear, their hearts will begin to understand, and they will return to me for healing and be healed.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then I asked, “O Lord, for how long?” He answered, “Until their houses and cities are destroyed and uninhabited and their land a desolate wasteland.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Until the Lord has exiled them all to a distant country and the entire land lies deserted.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yet if even a tenth remains there, it will be burned again. It will be like a fallen oak or terebinth tree when it is felled; the stump still lives to grow again.” Now, the “stump” is the holy seed.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">During the reign of Ahaz, the son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah, two kings launched an attack against Jerusalem: Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, the king of Israel. But they failed to conquer it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When the royal court was told that Syria had formed an alliance with the northern kingdom of Israel, the heart of King Ahaz and all his people trembled with fear, like trees swaying in the wind.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Yahweh spoke to Isaiah and said, “Go and meet with King Ahaz. You’ll find him on the road to the Washerman’s Field at the end of the aqueduct where it empties into the upper pool. Take with you your son, whom you named a Remnant Will Return.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Give him this message: ‘Stay calm! Be quiet and guard your heart! Don’t panic or be discouraged over these two smoldering stubs of firewood, because of the rage of Rezin and Aram, the son of Remaliah.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Syria has plotted with the northern kingdom of Israel and the son of Remaliah to come against you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They are saying, “We will attack Judah and cut off Jerusalem—we will terrorize and conquer it for ourselves and install the son of Tabeel as king!” ’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now hear what the Lord Yahweh says: “They will not succeed—it will never happen!</verse>
				<verse number="8">For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Sixty-five years from now the northern kingdom of Israel will be shattered, with nothing left of it.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The head of the northern kingdom of Israel is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not be able to stand at all!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Again Lord Yahweh spoke to Ahaz:</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Go ahead—ask for a sign from Yahweh, your God. Ask for something big, so miraculous that you will know only God did it!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Ahaz answered, “I will not ask. I won’t attempt to test the Lord Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So Isaiah said, “Pay attention, family of David. It’s bad enough to try the patience of a prophet but even worse when you try the patience of my God as well!</verse>
				<verse number="14">The Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold—the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son and will name him God Among Us.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He will eat curdled milk and honey, and he will know enough to refuse the evil and choose the good.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yet even before that time comes for him to know good and evil, the lands of those two kings you dread will be deserted.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“The Lord Yahweh is going to bring days of catastrophic trouble—on you, on your people, and on the whole royal court—not seen since the northern kingdom of Israel broke off from Judah. He is going to bring the king of Assyria with his great army!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">In that day, the Lord Yahweh will whistle and call for flies from Egypt’s lower streams. He will whistle for bees from the land of Assyria,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and they will swarm down upon you and settle into the steep ravines, the crevices of the rocks, on every thorn bush and at every stagnant pool.</verse>
				<verse number="20">In that day, the Lord will take his “razor,” the hired king of Assyria from beyond the Euphrates, and he will shave your head, your legs, and also your beard, leaving you ashamed and exposed!</verse>
				<verse number="21">In that day, if a farmer keeps alive only one heifer and two goats,</verse>
				<verse number="22">they will give so much milk that he will have more than he needs. And everyone left in the land will have all the milk and honey they desire.</verse>
				<verse number="23">In that day, the fine vineyards, each with a thousand vines and worth a thousand pieces of silver, will be a wilderness overgrown with weeds, briars, and thorn bushes.</verse>
				<verse number="24">People will hunt there with bow and arrow but will find nothing except thorn bushes and briars!</verse>
				<verse number="25">The once-cultivated hillsides where vineyards used to grow will be completely overgrown with thorns so that people will be afraid to go there. It will become a place where cattle graze and sheep trample.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">The Lord Yahweh said to me, “Take a large tablet and engrave upon it these words using the stylus of a man: Quickly—to the Plunder! Hurry—to the Loot!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then summon two reliable men, Uriah the priest and Zechariah, son of Jeberechiah, to act as witnesses.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then I slept with my wife, the prophetess; she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Then the Lord Yahweh told me, “You will name him Quickly—to the Plunder! Hurry—to the Loot!</verse>
				<verse number="4">For before the boy knows how to say ‘my father’ or ‘my mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and Samaria will be plundered and carried away by the king of Assyria!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The Lord Yahweh spoke to me again:</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Because these people have rejected the gentle flowing stream of my loving presence and melt in fear before Rezin and the son of Remaliah,</verse>
				<verse number="7">now, therefore, the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty, massive flood of the Euphrates. The king of Assyria and all his glory will overflow on you like a river flooding its channels and running over all its banks!</verse>
				<verse number="8">It will flood into Judah, swirling over it, overflowing and reaching up to your neck, O Immanuel, and spread out its wings over your entire land!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">You will be broken, O nations, and will be shattered. Listen, all you distant nations. Prepare for war, though it will backfire on you! Prepare for war, yet you will be shattered!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Go ahead, hatch a plot, but it will be foiled! Go ahead, speak a word, but it will not stand, for God is with us!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh ’s mighty hand rested on me, and he gave me a strong warning not to act like these people.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Don’t believe their every conspiracy rumor. And don’t fear what they fear—don’t be moved or terrified.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Fear nothing and no one except Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies! Honor him as holy. Be in awe before him with deepest reverence!</verse>
				<verse number="14">He will become for you a holy sanctuary but for them a stone people trip over. He is a rock that causes the two houses of Israel to stumble—a trap and a snare for the people of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Many will stumble and fall and be broken. Yes, they will be snared and taken away captive.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now, tie up the scroll and preserve it as legal evidence. Seal my instructions for the future for my disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I will wait for the Lord Yahweh, who hides his face from the family of Jacob. And I will place all my hope in him!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Behold—here I stand, and the children whom the Lord Yahweh has given me are for signs and wonders in Israel, sent from the Lord Almighty, Commander of Angel Armies, who is enthroned on Mount Zion!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now, suppose someone says, “Consult mediums and spiritists who moan and mutter their incantations in their ritual pits; after all, isn’t it right for people to seek oracles from their gods by asking the dead about the destiny of the living?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">You are to answer them: “Listen to the teaching and instruction of the Lord! If their speech does not line up with his word, they will have no light of dawn!</verse>
				<verse number="21">They will wander here and there, distressed and hungry. And when they are famished, they will be enraged and begin to curse their king and their God. If they look to the heavens</verse>
				<verse number="22">or to the earth, they will find only despair and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into obscure darkness!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">No more gloom for those who are in distress! Although the Lord greatly humbled the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali, he will one day bestow upon them great honor—from the Mediterranean eastward to the other side of the Jordan and throughout the Galilee of the gentiles.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Those who walked in darkness have seen a radiant light shining upon them. They once lived in the shadows of death, but now a glorious light has dawned!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Lord, you have multiplied the nation and given them overwhelming joy! They are ecstatic in your presence and rejoice like those who bring in a great harvest and those who divide up the spoils of victory!</verse>
				<verse number="4">For you have broken the chains that have bound your people and lifted off the heavy bar across their shoulders, the rod the oppressor used against them. You have shattered all their bondage, just as you did when Midian’s armies were defeated.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Every boot of marching troops and every uniform caked with blood will be burned as fuel for the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="6">A child has been born for us; a son has been given to us. The responsibility of complete dominion will rest on his shoulders, and his name will be: the Wonderful One, the Extraordinary Strategist, the Mighty God, the Father of Eternity, the Prince of Peace!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Great and vast is his dominion. He will bring immeasurable peace and prosperity. He will rule on David’s throne and over David’s kingdom to establish and uphold it by promoting justice and righteousness from this time forward and forevermore. The marvelous passion that the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has for his people will ensure that it is finished!</verse>
				<verse number="8">The Lord decreed a word against Jacob, and it brought calamity upon Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And all the people of Ephraim and Samaria knew of it. Their hearts filled with pride and they arrogantly boasted,</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Our brick walls may have crumbled, but we will rebuild them with dressed stones. Invading armies may have cut down our sycamore trees, but we will plant cedars in their place!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So the Lord Yahweh stirred up their enemies and strengthened Rezin’s foes, and they came against the people.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Syrians on the east, Philistines on the west—they came with bared teeth and devoured Israel. Yet despite all this, his anger did not subside, and his hand of judgment is poised to strike them again.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For the people did not repent and turn to the one who struck them or seek the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="14">In a single day, the Lord Yahweh cut off from Israel both head and tail, palm branch and reed.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The elders and dignitaries are the head, and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The leaders have led them astray, and the citizens are left in confusion.</verse>
				<verse number="17">That is why the Lord did not show pity to the young people or have compassion on their orphans and widows. For everyone was godless and did evil and each mouth spewed out wickedness. Therefore, the Lord’s anger has not subsided, and his hand is poised to strike them again.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Surely wickedness burned like an out-of-control fire, consuming thorns and thistles. It set ablaze the thickets of the forest with flames swirling upward in columns of smoke.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The land was scorched because of the anger of the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. The people themselves became fuel for the fire, and no one showed compassion toward another.</verse>
				<verse number="20">With their right hands they snatched what belonged to others, yet remained hungry. With their left hands they stole food, yet they were starving and even ate their own offspring!</verse>
				<verse number="21">Manasseh devoured Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh, and together they turned against Judah. Yet despite all this, the Lord’s anger has not subsided, and his hand is poised to strike them again.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Woe to those who legalize injustice and write oppressive legislation!</verse>
				<verse number="2">You rip away the rights of the poor and prey upon widows and orphans!</verse>
				<verse number="3">What will come of you on your day of visitation when disaster comes from afar? To whom will you run for help? And what will you do then with all your great wealth?</verse>
				<verse number="4">You’ll have no option but to cringe among the captives or fall among the corpses of the slain! Yet despite all this, his anger has not subsided, and his hand is poised to strike.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Woe to arrogant Assyria, the rod of my anger! The club I place in the king’s hand is my fury.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I am the one who has sent him against a godless nation and ordered him to attack a people who anger me. I sent him to take the spoil and seize the plunder and to trample them down like dust in the street.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But he has no clue what he’s doing, and he has something else in mind. He plans on annihilating many nations</verse>
				<verse number="8">and thinks, “After all, I have made my executive commanders into kings.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Calneh will be no different than Carchemish, whom I destroyed. I’ll destroy Hamath as I did Arpad and make Samaria like Damascus.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Since I was able to seize kingdoms full of idols and images more powerful and more impressive than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,</verse>
				<verse number="11">won’t I do the same thing to Jerusalem and Samaria and their idols?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">But when the Lord has carried out his purpose on Mount Zion and Jerusalem, he will punish the king of Assyria because of his overbearing arrogance and unrestrained pride!</verse>
				<verse number="13">He boasted, “Look what I have done by the strength of my hand and by my wisdom. See how clever I am! I have erased the borders of nations and plundered their treasures. I have been like a mighty conqueror, subduing those in strong fortresses.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I seized their wealth as one who found an unprotected nest. As one who gathers eggs that have been left behind, so I gathered the wealth of the world. And the young birds could neither move a wing nor even open their mouths to peep!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Is the axe greater than the one who wields it? Is the saw greater than the one who cuts with it? Can the axe strike without a hand to move it? Can a lifeless wooden cane walk all by itself?</verse>
				<verse number="16">Therefore, the sovereign Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will send a devastating plague among Assyria’s proud warriors. Yes, the “glory” of Assyria will be burned and go up in smoke!</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the Light of Israel will become a fire in their midst, and the Holy One will become a flame! He will consume the thorns and thistles of the Assyrian king in one day!</verse>
				<verse number="18">The splendor of his forest and orchard will be completely destroyed, like a dying man fading away.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The forest will have so few trees left that even a little boy could count them.</verse>
				<verse number="20">In that day, neither the remnant of Israel nor the survivors of the house of Jacob will lean anymore upon the one who abused them, but they will lean fully on the faithfulness of the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="21">A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob’s tribes to the mighty God.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Though your people Israel were as many as the sand on the seashore, only a remnant will return. Destruction has been decreed, and it will be overflowing with righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will complete the destruction he has decreed upon the whole land.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So hear what the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has to say: “My Zion-people, do not be gripped with fear over the Assyrians who oppress and abuse you, as the Egyptians did long ago.</verse>
				<verse number="25">After only a brief moment, I will end my indignation against you, and it will fall upon them to their destruction!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">The Lord Yahweh, who commands angel armies, will wield his whip against them, as when he struck Midian at the rock of Oreb. And once again he will raise his rod over the waters, as he did in Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="27">In that day the Lord will remove the heavy burden from your shoulders and break off the yoke of bondage from your necks because of the heavy anointing upon you!</verse>
				<verse number="28">The Assyrian army attacked Aiath; they passed over into Migron and stored their equipment at Michmash.</verse>
				<verse number="29">They went through the pass and spent the night at Geba. Ramah was alarmed and trembled. Those in Gibeah, the city of Saul, ran for their lives.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Cry aloud, O daughter of Gallim! Listen, O Laishah! Poor Anathoth!</verse>
				<verse number="31">Madmenah is retreating; the residents of Gebim are hiding.</verse>
				<verse number="32">This very day, standing at Nob, he will shake his fist at the mountain of the daughter of the house of Zion— at the hill of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Behold, the Sovereign Lord of Angel Armies is about to cut off the branches with terrifying power. He will cut down the exalted heights of the high, and all the lofty will be brought low.</verse>
				<verse number="34">He will slash the thickets of the forest as with an axe, and Lebanon will fall before the Mighty One.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">The cut-off stump of Jesse will sprout, and a fruitful Branch will grow from his roots:</verse>
				<verse number="2">the Spirit of Yahweh will rest upon him, the Spirit of Extraordinary Wisdom, the Spirit of Perfect Understanding, the Spirit of Wise Strategy, the Spirit of Mighty Power, the Spirit of Revelation, and the Spirit of the Fear of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He will find his delight in living by the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord. He will neither judge by appearances nor make his decisions based on rumors.</verse>
				<verse number="4">With righteousness he will uphold justice for the poor and defend the lowly of the earth. His words will be like a scepter of power that conquers the world, and with his breath he will slay the lawless one.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Righteousness will be his warrior’s sash and faithfulness his belt.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then the wolf will be subdued and live with the gentle lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the gentle lamb. The young calf and the ferocious lion will be together, and as a shepherd drives his flock, a small child will guide them along!</verse>
				<verse number="7">The cow and the bear will graze alongside each other; cubs and calves will lie down together. The lion, like the ox, will eat straw.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The nursing child will play safely near the rattlesnake’s den, and the toddler will stretch out his hand and shine light over the serpent.</verse>
				<verse number="9">On all my holy mountain of Zion, nothing evil or harmful will be found. For the earth will be filled with the intimate knowledge of the Lord Yahweh just as water swells the sea!</verse>
				<verse number="10">On that day, the root of Jesse will be lifted up as a miracle -sign to rally the people. Gentiles will diligently seek him, and his resting place will be glorious!</verse>
				<verse number="11">On that day, the Lord will extend his hand a second time to restore the remnant of his people from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and the coastlands of the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He will lift up a banner among the nations and will gather the scattered Jews, and assemble the outcasts of Israel from the four corners of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Ephraim will be cleansed of envy, and those who are hostile to Judah will be cut off. Ephraim will no longer be jealous of Judah, and Judah will no longer be hostile toward Ephraim.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But they will swoop down on the slopes of Philistia to the west; together they will plunder the people of the east. They will rule over Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will obey them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The Lord Yahweh will dry up the gulf of the Egyptian Sea. He will raise his hand over the Euphrates, and with the might of his wind, he will split it into seven streams that can be easily crossed in sandals.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then there will be a highway leading out of Assyria for his remnant people to return, just as there was for Israel when they were set free from Egypt.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">In that day you will sing, “I praise you, Lord Yahweh, for even though you were angry with me, your anger turned away, and now you tenderly comfort me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Behold—God is my salvation! I am confident, unafraid, and I will trust in you.” Yes! The Lord Yah is my might and my melody; he has become my salvation!</verse>
				<verse number="3">With triumphant joy you will drink deeply from the wells of salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="4">In that glorious day, you will say to one another, “Give thanks to the Lord and ask him for more! Tell the world about all that he does! Let them know how magnificent he is!”</verse>

			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">This is the prophecy against Babylon that God revealed to Isaiah, son of Amoz:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Raise high a signal flag on a barren hilltop! Shout out! Beckon my armies to invade the gates of the nobles,</verse>
				<verse number="3">for I have given orders to my consecrated ones. I have summoned my mighty heroes, those who rejoice in my triumph, that they may execute my anger.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Listen! A thunderous noise is heard on the mountain, like that of a massive multitude. Listen! Kingdoms are in an uproar; nations are assembling together. The almighty Lord Yahweh is mustering an army for war.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They are coming from a faraway land, from the end of the heavens. Here comes Yahweh with his instruments of judgment, ready to ravage the entire land.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Wail, for the day of the Lord Yahweh is near! It will come with the destructive power of Shaddai.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For this reason, every hand will go limp and every heart will melt.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All the Babylonians will be seized with panic and pain. Anguish will grip them like a woman in labor. They will look at one another with astonishment, and their faces will be flames of fire!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Behold! The day of the Lord is coming with pitiless fury and fierce anger. The land will be made desolate, destroying the sinners who inhabit it.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not give their light. The rising sun will be obscured, and the moon won’t shine.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“I will bring punishment to the world for its evil and to the wicked for their sins. I will shatter the arrogance of the proud, and will humble the pride of the high and mighty.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will make a person scarcer than fine gold and people rarer than a wedge of gold from Ophir.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Therefore, I will make the heavens shudder and the earth shake from its foundation because of the wrath of the Lord, Commander of Angel Armies, in the day of his fierce anger.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Like a hunted gazelle, each will return to his own people, and like sheep with no one to gather them, each will flee to his native land.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Captured ones will be slain, and those who are caught will die by the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their very eyes. Their houses will be looted and their wives raped.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Behold! I am stirring up the Medes against them, who neither value silver nor delight in gold.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They will slaughter the young men, and show no pity on infants nor compassion on children.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">God will overthrow Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the splendor and pride of the Babylonians, exactly as he did to Sodom and Gomorrah.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Babylon will never rise again, nor will she be inhabited for many generations. Bedouins will not even pitch their tents there, and shepherds will refuse to rest their flocks there.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Wild animals will roam there, and their vacant houses will be overrun by eerie creatures — nothing but owls and goat-shaped demons dancing!</verse>
				<verse number="22">Hyenas will howl in her houses, and jackals will make their dens in her palaces. Babylon’s time is up, and her days are numbered!</verse>

			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">The Lord Yahweh will most certainly show tender mercy to the Israelites. He will choose them again and settle them in their own land. Even foreigners will accompany them and join with the Jewish people.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Nations will take them back to their own place, and the Jews will own their enemies as their inheritance in the land Yahweh gave them. They will take their captors captive and rule over those who once oppressed them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">In that day, when the Lord Yahweh has given you rest from your pain, trouble, and cruel bondage,</verse>
				<verse number="4">you will jeer at the king of Babylon and recite this proverb: “Your oppressor has been stilled and your onslaught is over!</verse>
				<verse number="5">The Lord Yahweh has shattered the staff of the wicked, the brutal rod of the rulers.</verse>
				<verse number="6">With their unceasing blows they used it cruelly to strike down nations. They subdued nations in anger with unrelenting persecution.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But now the whole earth rests and is at peace. It bursts out with singing;</verse>
				<verse number="8">even the cypresses and cedars of Lebanon join in, rejoicing over your demise, saying, ‘Now that you were laid low, no woodsman comes to cut us down.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="9">The underworld is all astir in preparation, ready to meet you when you show up. It rouses the spirits of the dead to greet you! All the former tyrants and despots rise from their thrones!</verse>
				<verse number="10">One and all will say to you: “ Look at you! You’ve become as weak as we are. Now you’re just like us!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Your pompous pride brought you down to the underworld with the hum of harps. But you will lie on a bed of maggots, and a blanket of worms will cover you!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Look how you have fallen from your heavenly place, O shining one, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the ground, you who conquered nations.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You said in your heart, ‘I will ascend into heaven and exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will rule on the mountain of the congregation, on the highest place of the sacred mountain.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will rise past the tops of the clouds and rival the Most High God!’</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yet down to the underworld you go— into the depths of the pit!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Everyone will stare at you and ponder your fate, saying, ‘Is this the man who shook the earth and made the kingdoms tremble?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Is this the man who made the world a desert and overthrew its cities and refused to free his prisoners and let them return home?’</verse>
				<verse number="18">Every king at death lies in state, each in his crypt of splendor,</verse>
				<verse number="19">but you are an unburied, trampled corpse, thrown out of your grave like a rotten stick and wrapped in the bloody clothing of those slain by the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You will not have a burial like them, because you destroyed both your land and your people. May your wicked descendants never be mentioned again!</verse>
				<verse number="21">Prepare to execute his sons because of the sins of their father. May they never rise to conquer the earth and cover the world with their cities.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">“I will rise up against them,” declares the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. “I will blot out the name Babylon and her survivors, her offspring and descendants,” declares the Lord Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“I will turn it into a swampland and a place for wild animals. Like dirt on the floor I will sweep it away with the broom of destruction,” declares the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, makes this solemn decree: “Be sure of this: Just as I have planned, so it will be. Every purpose of my heart will surely come to pass.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I will crush the Assyrians who invade my land. I will trample them on my mountains. Their yoke of slavery will be removed from my people and their heavy burden from their shoulders.</verse>
				<verse number="26">This is the plan that I have determined for the entire world. I will accomplish it by the demonstration of my mighty power throughout the earth!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">For the Lord Yahweh, the Commander of Angel Armies, has an amazing strategy, and who can thwart him? When he moves in power, who can stop him?</verse>
				<verse number="28">This prophecy came to Isaiah in the year King Ahaz died: Don’t rejoice too soon, you Philistines, just because the rod that beat you is broken!</verse>
				<verse number="29">A snake will sprout from the root of that serpent, and his descendant will be like a flying, fiery, burning one.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And through him the poorest of the poor will find pasture and the needy will lie down in peace. The Lord will starve the root of the Philistines with a famine that will annihilate your survivors.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Wail, O gate! Cry out, O city! Melt with fear, Philistia! For a cloud of smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler among them.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And what will be the answer of the messengers of the nations? That the Lord has laid the foundation of Zion, and in her his needy ones will find shelter.</verse>

			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Here is a prophecy concerning Moab: The city of Ar was devastated, destroyed in the night. The city of Kir was devastated, destroyed in the night.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The people of Dibon went to their temple to weep; they went up to their high places to lament. Moab wails with sorrow over what happened to Mount Nebo and Mount Medeba. Humiliated, every head is shaved bald and every beard cut off.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They pour into the streets wearing sackcloth. In public and in private, they fall down sobbing.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The cities of Heshbon and Elealah cry out; their voices are heard as far away as Jahaz; even the bravest warriors of Moab are shaken to the core.</verse>
				<verse number="5">My heart cries out for the people of Moab, for her fugitives who flee to Zoar and to Eglath-shelishiyah. Weeping, they climb the upward road to Luhith. Their loud cries of anguish are heard all along the way to Horonaim.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The River Nimrim has dried up; the grass has withered; new growth has failed, and vegetation has vanished.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Therefore, the refugees take with them over the Wadi of the Willows their possessions and the wealth they have acquired.</verse>
				<verse number="8">From one end of the land to the other, Moab is weeping; her wailing reaches to Eglaim and Beer-Elim.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For the waters of Dimon are full of blood, but I have something even worse in store for them: lions for the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">Send a flock of lambs from the rock of the desert as a gift to the leaders in Jerusalem, to the mountain of the Daughter of Zion.</verse>
				<verse number="2">At the banks of the River Arnon, the women of Moab are like newly hatched, fluttering birds.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They say, “Make a decision! Give us shelter. Hide the fugitives. Don’t betray them!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Allow the Moabite fugitives to stay with you. Be a shelter for them from the destroyer!” One day the oppressor will be no more. The destroyer will come to an end, and the tyrant will vanish from the land.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then a government of unfailing love will be established, with a faithful king in the tabernacle of David, passionate for justice and swift to do what is right.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We have heard about Moab’s pride. How haughty she is—filled with arrogance and insolence, with nothing more than empty boasts!</verse>
				<verse number="7">So now Moab will wail; everyone will wail over the ruin of their country. Lament and grieve for the foundations of Kir-Hareseth.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All the lush fields of Heshbon are dried up. The vineyards of Sibmah have struck down the lords of nations, whose vines reached northward to Jazer and spread to the desert. Their shoots spread out and extend across the Dead Sea.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So I weep along with Jazer over the vines of Sibmah. I drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh, for the shouts of joy over the harvest of fruit and grain have ceased.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Joyful celebrations are stilled in the orchards; in the vineyards, no one sings or shouts, and no one treads out wine in the presses. I have silenced your gleeful shouts.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Like harp strings, my heartstrings throb for Moab, and my inner being sighs for your broken walls, Kir-Hareseth.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When Moab comes to their high places to plead with all their might and enter their temples to pray, it will have no effect.</verse>
				<verse number="13">This was the word the Lord Yahweh spoke in the past about Moab,</verse>
				<verse number="14">but now the Lord Yahweh says, “In exactly three years, the splendor of Moab and her huge population will shrink to nothing; only a small and feeble remnant will remain.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">This is God’s message for Damascus: “Behold, Damascus is gone! It is no longer a city, only a heap of rubble.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Her ruins will be abandoned— left for flocks to lie down in with nothing to fear.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Damascus will lose the power of her fortress, and the strongholds of the northern kingdom will disappear. The remnant of Syria will be like Israel— stripped of its glory,” says the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“On that day, the beautiful splendor of Jacob’s northern tribes will be brought low, and they will become like skin and bones.</verse>
				<verse number="5">It will be as when a farmer harvests the standing grain and gathers armloads of grain, and as one gathers ears of grain in the Valley of Giants.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Yet some gleanings will remain, as when an olive tree is shaken, leaving two or three olives in the highest branches and four or five on its fruitful branches,” declares Lord Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="7">In that day, people will gaze toward their Creator, and their eyes will look in faith toward the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="8">They will not be infatuated with the religious altars their own hands crafted, nor by what their own fingers have made, nor with their sacred groves or altars of incense.</verse>
				<verse number="9">On that day their bustling cities will become deserted like those conquered by the Israelites— abandoned to thickets and undergrowth, it will all become desolate.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For you have ignored and forgotten the God who saves you and have not remembered your Rock of Safety. So what do you do? You cultivate your beautiful gardens and plant imported vines.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Even if on the day you plant them they begin to grow, and even if immediately you see them bud, your harvest will wither away in a day of grief and agony.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Ah, the thunder of many people joining together! They roar like the roar of the sea. Woe to the uproar of the many nations! They thunder like the crashing of ocean waves.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The nations are roaring like the roar of a massive waterfall, but when God rebukes them they disperse like chaff on the mountains, like a tumbleweed whirling in the wind.</verse>
				<verse number="14">In the evening—behold, sudden terror! Before the morning comes, they vanish! Such is the fate of those who plunder and try to rob us.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">Ah, the land of whirring wings, that is beyond the rivers of Cush,</verse>
				<verse number="2">sending their messengers by the way of the Nile in papyrus vessels gliding on the water! Go, you swift messengers, to a tall, smooth-skinned people feared far and wide, to a mighty conquering nation whose land the rivers divide.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Everyone everywhere, all who dwell on the earth, when a signal flag is raised on the mountain, take notice! When the shofar is blown, listen!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Here is what the Lord Yahweh said to me: “I will rest calm and confident as I look from my dwelling place, serene as on a pleasant summer day or as a cool, refreshing cloud in the heat of harvest.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Before the harvest, when the bud is ripening and the flower finishes, he will take his pruning hooks and cut off the shoots and remove them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They will all be left for the birds of prey on the mountains and for the wild animals to devour. Birds will eat them throughout the summer, and the animals will gnaw on the bones of the fallen all winter.</verse>
				<verse number="7">At that time, a tall, smooth-skinned people will bring gifts of tribute to the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. They are a people feared far and wide, a mighty conquering nation whose land the rivers divide. They will bring their gifts to Mount Zion, the place of the name of the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>

			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">A prophecy concerning Egypt: Behold! The Lord Yahweh is riding on a swift-soaring cloud! He is on his way to Egypt! The god-idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence, and the hearts of the Egyptians will melt within them!</verse>
				<verse number="2">“I will stir up civil strife and cause the Egyptians to fight against one another— one against the other, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The spirit of the Egyptians will be in panic, and I will confuse their strategies. They will seek guidance from their idols and by the spirits of the dead and consult with mediums and wizards.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I will give over the Egyptians into the hands of a cruel master; a brutal king will rule over them,” says the sovereign God, the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The Nile delta will dry up and the riverbed will become parched and dry.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Its canals will become stagnant and stink with rotting reeds, and the streams of Egypt will dry up, from a trickle to nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="7">All that is planted by the mouth of the river will dry up, and the fields along the brooks will wither and turn to dust blown away by the wind.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Fishermen will mourn. All who cast a fishhook into the river and those who cast their nets will catch nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Those who make clothing from combed flax will despair, and the weavers of linen will be distressed.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The pillars of Egypt’s foundations will be shattered and every worker grieved.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The elite of Zoan are nothing but fools, and the wisest of Pharaoh’s counselors gives foolish advice. How in the world can you say to Pharaoh, “I am a brilliant sage and a descendant of the ancient kings”?</verse>
				<verse number="12">Where, oh where, are all your sages? If they’re so wise, let them discover and tell you what the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has planned for Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Zoan’s elite have become utter fools; the nobles of Memphis are utterly deceived, and Egypt has been led astray by her tribal chiefs.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The Lord Yahweh has mixed up their minds and poured into them a distorted spirit that will make Egypt dizzy and act like a drunk who staggers around in his own vomit.</verse>
				<verse number="15">There is nothing anyone in Egypt can do— neither head nor tail, nor anyone of high or low position.</verse>
				<verse number="16">In that day, the Egyptians will become like women who tremble in fear because the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, shakes his fist at them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The land of Judah will become the dread of the Egyptians. They will quake whenever anybody even mentions it to them, because of what the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has in store for them!</verse>
				<verse number="18">In that day, there will be five Egyptian cities that speak the language of Canaan and swear their allegiance to the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, and one will be called the City of the Sun.</verse>
				<verse number="19">In that day, there will be an altar to the Lord Yahweh in the middle of Egypt and a sacred monument to honor him on her border.</verse>
				<verse number="20">It will be a sign and a visible reminder in the land of Egypt of the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. And they will cry out to him when they are oppressed, and he will send a mighty deliverer and champion to their rescue!</verse>
				<verse number="21">The Lord Yahweh will reveal to them who he really is, and the Egyptians will know him intimately. They will worship him with sacrifices and burnt offerings. They will make vows to the Lord Yahweh, and they will keep them.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The Lord Yahweh will wound the Egyptians, but when they turn back to him, he will heal them. Yes, the Lord Yahweh will listen to their hearts’ cry, and he will heal and restore them.</verse>
				<verse number="23">In that day there will be a highway all the way from Egypt to Assyria. Like long-lost brothers, the Egyptians and the Assyrians will be joined together and they will worship and serve the Lord Yahweh! And in that day, Israel will become the third partner with Egypt and Assyria as a blessing to all the earth. For the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will bless them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt, my people! Blessed be Assyria, my handiwork! And blessed be Israel, my inheritance!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">In the year that the Assyrian king Sargon sent his supreme commander to attack Ashdod, he came and captured it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">At that time the Lord Yahweh said to Isaiah, the son of Amoz, “Take off your clothes and sandals.” Isaiah did as he was told and walked about naked and barefoot.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then the Lord Yahweh said, “Just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years as a prophetic sign and a wonder as a warning of what is coming to Egypt and Cush,</verse>
				<verse number="4">so will the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt and Cush, both young and old. They will be stripped and barefoot, with buttocks bared, to publicly humiliate Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And those who put their hope in ‘glorious Cush’ and ‘mighty Egypt,’ will be shattered and totally ashamed.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">When that day comes, those who live in the coastal region of Philistia will say, “Oh no! If this is what happened to those we hoped would come and rescue us from the Assyrian king, what chance do we have of escape?”</verse>

			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">Here is a prophecy concerning Babylon, the Desert by the Sea: As whirlwinds rushing in from the southland, an invader comes in from the desert, from a land to be feared.</verse>
				<verse number="2">A terrifying revelation has been given to me: The betrayer betrays; the destroyer destroys. Arise, you Elamites! Lay siege, you Medes! I will put an end to all the grief she brought to the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="3">There’s a churning deep inside me, like labor pains of a woman about to give birth. I’m too anguished by what I hear and too frightened by what I see.</verse>
				<verse number="4">My mind is reeling; I’m filled with panic. I longed for twilight, but now I tremble through the night.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I see them prepare the table and spread their rugs, then they eat and they drink. Get up, you military officers! Anoint your shields for battle!</verse>
				<verse number="6">For this is what the Lord said to me: “Go post a sentry and have him report what he sees.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When he sees them come with chariots and advancing warriors riding on horses, donkeys, and camels, let him be alert—extremely alert!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the sentry cries out, “I continually stand on this watchtower day after day for you, O Lord. I’m stationed at my post throughout the night.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Look! Someone’s coming! It’s a man in a chariot with a team of horses. He shouts out, ‘Fallen, fallen, Babylon has fallen! All the idols of their gods lie shattered on the ground!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="10">My people, lying crushed on the threshing floor, I declare to you what I have heard from the God of Israel, Yahweh, the Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Here is a prophecy about Dumah: Someone keeps calling me from the land of Edom, saying, “Watchman, how much longer is the night? Watchman, how much longer is the night?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">The watchman answers, “Morning comes, but a dark night endures. If you want to ask again, then come back and ask.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">A prophecy concerning Arabia: You caravans from Dedan, you will camp among the thickets in the desert land of Arabia.</verse>
				<verse number="14">People of Tema, come and bring water to the thirsty and bread for the fugitives.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For they have fled from the battle, from the drawn swords, from the bent bows, and from the weight of warfare.</verse>
				<verse number="16">This is what the Sovereign God said to me: “Within exactly one year, all the splendor of Kedar will end.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And all the weapons left of Kedar’s warriors will be few, for the Lord Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken.”</verse>

				<verse number="1">A prophecy concerning the “Valley of Vision”: What’s happening with you? Why have you all gone up to the rooftops?</verse>
				<verse number="2">The whole city is in an uproar. What’s happened to the once happy, bustling city? The bodies of the slain litter your streets. They were not slain by the sword on the battlefield but executed.</verse>
				<verse number="3">All your leaders have fled far away, and those who were found were taken captive— before they even shot a single arrow.</verse>
				<verse number="4">That is why I said, “Leave me alone to weep my bitter tears. Don’t even try to comfort me concerning my beloved people being destroyed.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has a day in store—a day of tumult, trampling, and terror in the “Valley of Vision.” It is a day when they breach the walls and the people cry out to the mountain of holiness.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The soldiers of Elam attacked with chariots and cavalry, armed with bows and arrows. The troops of Kir advanced with shields ready.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Your lush valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen took their stand at your gates.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He removed his protection from Judah. In that day, you looked for additional weapons from the storehouse of the Forest of Lebanon.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You discovered the many breaches in the City of David, and you collected water in the lower pool.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You inspected the houses in Jerusalem and tore some down to fortify the wall.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You built a reservoir between the two walls in the city to conserve water flowing down from the old pool, but you gave no thought to the one who made it. You did not trust in the one who formed it long ago!</verse>
				<verse number="12">In that day, the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, called you to repent with weeping and mourning and to show your remorse by shaving your heads and wearing sackcloth.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But instead, you celebrated with joy and festivity, slaughtering the sheep and the fatted ox, saying, “We will feast on meat and drink much wine. Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Revealed in my ears are the words of the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies: “Until your dying day, certainly I will not forgive this sin.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">This is what the Lord Yahweh, the Commander of Angel Armies, has to say: “Go to Shebna, the treasurer of the palace, and say to him,</verse>
				<verse number="16">‘What right do you have to be here, and who gave you permission? And why do you chisel out a tomb for yourself here, carving out your royal burial place, a dwelling place in the rock?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Watch out, O strong man, for the Lord is about to seize you and hurl you down.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He will sling you around and around and throw you like a ball into a distant, barren land. There you will die, and all your splendid chariots will lie there in the dust. You are a disgrace to your master’s house!</verse>
				<verse number="19">I will kick you out of office and pull you down from your high position!’</verse>
				<verse number="20">“On that day, I will appoint my servant Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, to take your place.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I will honor him by clothing him with your robe and binding your priestly sash upon him. I will transfer your authority into his hands, and he will be a father to those living in Jerusalem and to the people of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I will place upon his shoulders the key to the treasures of David’s palace. He will open doors that no one can shut, and he will shut doors that no one can open.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I will strike a blow to him as a nail in a secure place, and he will be a glorious throne of honor for his father’s house.</verse>
				<verse number="24">All the glory of his father’s house they will fasten to him, including offspring and branches that will trust in him. Every vessel, jar, and bowl, both small and great, will be fastened to him.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“And in that day,” declares the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, “the nail fastened in a secure place will give way and be cut off and fall. And all the load hanging on it will fall off.” The Lord Yahweh has spoken.</verse>

			<chapter number="23">
				<verse number="1">A prophecy for Tyre and Sidon: Wail, you cargo ships of Tarshish! For Tyre, your port city, has fallen without a house or a harbor! Word has come to them from the land of Cyprus.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Be silent, you inhabitants of the coast and you merchants of Sidon, once thronged by seafarers.</verse>
				<verse number="3">On the great waters your revenue was the grain from the Nile basin. The harvest of the Nile was your revenue. You were merchants who traded with the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Sidon, be ashamed, for the sea, the stronghold of the sea, declares, “I have never gone into labor to give birth to children, nor have I raised up sons or daughters.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">When the Egyptians hear it, they will be stunned over the destruction of Tyre.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Cross over to Tarshish. Wail, you inhabitants of the coast.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Is this your once boisterous city, founded so long ago? Is this the city that once sent settlers over the sea?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Who has planned this for imperial Tyre, who once wore her crown? Your merchants were nobles, and your traders were honored by the world.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh, the Commander of Angel Armies, has planned it! His plan is to eliminate the pride of your presumed splendor and to humiliate the honored of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Daughter Tarshish, cross over your land as one crosses the Nile, for there is no more harbor marketplace.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh has stretched out his hand over the sea of humanity and has shaken the kingdoms of this world. He has given his command to destroy Phoenicia’s fortresses.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He said, “Fair Sidon, the oppressed one, your celebrating is over. Rise and cross over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Behold the land of the Babylonians. They are a people who have lost their identity. The Assyrians have made her a home for wild animals. They erected siege towers against her, demolished her palaces, and made her a heap of ruins.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Wail, you merchant ships of Tarshish, for your fortress is destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="15">In that day, Tyre will remain forgotten for seventy years, equal to the life span of a king. After seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song about the prostitute:</verse>
				<verse number="16">Take a harp and go about the city, you prostitute long forgotten. Make your sweet melody and sing many songs so that you will be remembered again.</verse>
				<verse number="17">At the end of seventy years, the Lord Yahweh will restore Tyre, but she will return to her trade. She will prostitute herself again with every kingdom of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But her merchandise and earnings will be set apart as holy to the Lord Yahweh. They will neither be stored nor hoarded, but they will supply abundant food and splendid garments for those who live in the presence of the Lord Yahweh!</verse>

			<chapter number="24">
				<verse number="1">Behold! The Lord Yahweh is about to devastate the earth and make it desolate. He will mar its surface and scatter the inhabitants.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Everyone will experience the same fate— priests and people, masters and slaves, their maids and mistresses, buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers, rich and poor.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The earth will be utterly devastated and ruined, for the Lord Yahweh has spoken this word!</verse>
				<verse number="4">The ground itself mourns and withers; the soil languishes over the sins of its people, and the wealthy elite wither and languish.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The people have polluted the earth beneath their feet by disobeying laws, violating truth, and breaking the ancient, everlasting covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Therefore a curse devours the earth; its people suffer under their guilt, causing earth’s inhabitants to dwindle, and their number is reduced to so few.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The new wine dries up, the vine withers, and all the party-goers groan with disappointment.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The joyful mirth of the tambourines is stilled, the jubilant noise of the revelers is ended, and the happy sound of the harp falls silent.</verse>
				<verse number="9">No more wine and song! Hard liquor has become bitter to those who drink it.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The city lies in chaos, and no one can enter.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Riots break out because there is no wine. The sun has set on their gladness and joy; celebrations have disappeared from the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The city is left desolate with her gates battered down.</verse>
				<verse number="13">As an olive tree is shaken clean of its olives and a grapevine picked clean of its grapes, so will be the fate of the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The remnant lifts up its voice with a joyful shout. From the west they praise the majesty of the Lord Yahweh,</verse>
				<verse number="15">and in the east they give glory to the Lord God! The coastlands magnify the name of Yahweh, the Lord God of Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="16">From all over the world we hear their songs of praise— songs of glory and beauty to the Righteous One! But I said, “I feel I’m wasting away. I’m doomed; I’m wasting away.” With deception, deceivers deceive! With treachery, the treacherous betray!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Terror, pit, and trap are waiting for you, inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The one who flees from the report of terror will fall into the pit. And whoever crawls out of the pit will be caught by the trap. Heaven’s floodgates opened and earth’s foundations trembled.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The earth is breaking, breaking! The earth is crumbling, crumbling! The earth is tottering, tottering!</verse>
				<verse number="20">The earth staggers like a drunkard, as a hut sways in a storm. Its sin lies heavy upon it; it falls to rise no more.</verse>
				<verse number="21">In that day, the Lord Yahweh will punish heaven’s host and the kings of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="22">They will be gathered together and locked up in a prison like prisoners in a pit, and after many days, they will be punished.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then the sun and moon will hang their heads in shame, for Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will reign! He will manifest his glory on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, before all her elders!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="25">
				<verse number="1">Lord Yahweh, you are my glorious God! I will exalt you and praise your name forever, for you have done so many wonderful things. Well-thought-out plans you formed in ages past— you’ve been faithful and true to fulfill them all!</verse>
				<verse number="2">The city that was once mighty you’ve turned into a heap of rubble; the fortified city now lies in ruins. The foreigner’s fortress is no more and will never be rebuilt.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Therefore, superpower nations will glorify you and the cities of terrorist nations will revere you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You have been a fortress-protector for the poor, a mighty stronghold for the needy in their distress, a shelter from the sudden storm, and a shade from the shimmering heat of the day. For the fury of tyrants was like a winter windstorm battering against the wall,</verse>
				<verse number="5">and like the heat of a drought in a desert land; but you subdued the heat under the shade of clouds. You alone silence the song of tyrants.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will host a rich feast on this mountain for all peoples— a feast with plenty of meat and well-aged wine, with an abundance of food and the finest of wine.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And on this mountain, he will destroy the shroud wrapped around all the people, the veil spread over all nations.</verse>
				<verse number="8">It is the gloom of death! He will swallow it up in victory forever! And God, Lord Yahweh, will wipe away every tear from every face. He will remove every trace of disgrace that his people have suffered throughout the world, for the Lord Yahweh has promised it!</verse>
				<verse number="9">In that day they will say, “Behold! This is our God! We’ve waited for him, and he saved us! This one, the Lord Yahweh —he is worth the wait! We will keep shouting with joy as we find our bliss in his salvation-kiss!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">The mighty, gracious hand of the Lord Yahweh will rest upon this mountain, but the Moabites will be trampled under his feet as straw gets trampled into the manure.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They will stretch out their arms in it like a swimmer stretches out his arms to swim, yet God will bring down their pride, and they will thrash and sink despite their struggle.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He will tear down the high walls of Moab’s fortresses and flatten them into the dust.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="26">
				<verse number="1">A day is coming when this song will be sung in the land of Judah: “The city is a stronghold for us! The Lord’s salvation, like inner and outer walls, makes it secure.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Open the gates and let a righteous, faith-filled people enter in.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Perfect, absolute peace surrounds those whose imaginations are consumed with you; they confidently trust in you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yes, trust in the Lord Yahweh forever and ever! For Yah, the Lord God, is your Rock of Ages!</verse>
				<verse number="5">He knocks down the high and mighty, and the lofty city he humbles and levels down to the dust,</verse>
				<verse number="6">to be trampled down by the feet of the poor and exploited.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">The path of the righteous is smooth and level; God, the Just One, you make a clear path for them.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yes, we will follow your ways, Lord Yahweh, and entwine our hearts with yours, for the fame of your name is all that we desire.</verse>
				<verse number="9">At night I yearn for you with all my heart; in the morning my spirit reaches out to you. When you display your judgments on the earth, people learn the ways of righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But when mercy is shown to scoundrels, they still aren’t able to learn righteousness. Even in a land of integrity, they still do wrong, for they ignore the great majesty of the Lord Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Lord Yahweh, you lift your mighty hand, but they do not see it. Let them witness how much you love your people and be ashamed. Let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Lord Yahweh, you will establish peace and prosperity for us, for all we have accomplished is the result of what you work through us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Lord Yahweh, our God, other lords have ruled over us, but we praise your name alone.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Their dead don’t come back to life; their ghosts do not rise. For you have punished and destroyed them, wiping out even the memory of them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You have made our nation grow! Lord Yahweh, you have made our nation grow; you have revealed your glory, and you have extended all the borders of the land.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Lord Yahweh, in their distress, they reached out to you. When you chastened them, they poured out prayer to you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Lord Yahweh, we were like a pregnant woman going into labor pains— writhing, screaming, and ready to deliver, all because of you.</verse>
				<verse number="18">We were full term. We pushed and strained, but we gave birth only to wind! We accomplished nothing and have not brought deliverance into the world, nor its inhabitants new life.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But your dead will live again! Their bodies will rise from the dead! It’s time to awaken and sing for joy, you dwellers in the dust! As the glistening, radiant dew refreshes the earth, so the Lord will awaken those dwelling among the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Go, my people, into your inner chambers and close the doors behind you. Hide for a little while, until his indignation is over.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For the Lord is coming out from his heavenly place to punish people for their sins. The earth itself will expose the blood spilled upon it, and the ground will no longer hide its slain.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="27">
				<verse number="1">In that day, the Lord Yahweh will mercilessly wield his massive, mighty sword and punish Leviathan, the swift, slithering serpent. He will slay the dragon of the sea — Leviathan, the twisting serpent.</verse>
				<verse number="2">In that day, they will sing the song “The Vineyard of Delight.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">“I, the Lord, watch over my vineyard of delight. Moment by moment, I water it in love and protect it day and night.</verse>
				<verse number="4">There is no anger in me, for if I found briars and thorns I would burn them up and march to battle against them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So let the branches cling to my protection when they make true peace with me. Yes, let them make me their friend.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">The coming ones of Jacob’s tribes will take root. Israel’s branches will bud and blossom, and her beautiful fruit will cover the face of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Has Yahweh struck Israel as other nations have struck her? Has Israel been killed like her enemies have been killed?</verse>
				<verse number="8">No, but with measured justice he exiled them and contended with them. He removed them from the land with his severe blast on the day his searing east wind blew.</verse>
				<verse number="9">By the mercy of Yahweh the guilt of Jacob will be forgiven. Yet the full proof of their forgiveness will be when they crush all the altars to false gods and make them into chalkstones, crushed to pieces, with neither cultic poles nor incense altars still standing.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The fortified city lies in ruins, forsaken and deserted like a wilderness. Cattle graze there and lie down, chewing on twigs and branches.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The trees are withered and stripped bare, and their women gather dead branches for firewood, because they are a people of no understanding. That is why their Maker will show them no compassion, and he who formed them will show them no favor.</verse>
				<verse number="12">In that day, from the Egyptian border to the Euphrates, the Lord Yahweh will gather one by one the people of Israel, as one sifts wheat from the chaff.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When that day comes, a great trumpet will sound, and those lost in the land of Assyria and Egypt— all the exiles —will come and bow down before the Lord Yahweh in Jerusalem and worship him on the holy mountain!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="28">
				<verse number="1">Woe to the pride of Israel’s drunkards, worn like a garland on their heads! Their glory is but wilted flowers, worn like a crown on the heads of those bloated with rich food and overcome by wine.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Behold! The Lord has one who is strong and mighty, and he will come like a hailstorm and like a destroying wind! With a storm of massive, flooding waters, his mighty power will knock it to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="3">That proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trampled underfoot,</verse>
				<verse number="4">and the glory of these proud leaders will fade and disappear like the first figs of the season, which are picked and eaten as soon as they are ripe.</verse>
				<verse number="5">In that day, Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will be a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty for the remnant of his people.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He will be a Spirit of justice for judges to render right decisions. And he will be strength and bravery for those who turn back the battle at the gate.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Moreover, the prophets and priests are drunk. They stagger because of wine and stumble around because of strong drink. They are confused with wine, stumbling because of strong drink. They’re too drunk to understand their prophetic visions. They’re too drunk to render right decisions in judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All of their banqueting tables are covered with filthy vomit; vomit is everywhere!</verse>
				<verse number="9">They say, “Who does this prophet think he is to try to teach us? Who really cares about his message? It’s only good for babies just learning to talk.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Do, do this, and do, do that, a rule about this and a rule about that, here a little, there a little.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Since they won’t listen to me, God will use another mouthpiece to speak to them. With stammering lips and in a foreign language, he will speak to this people.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For he has said to them, “This is your rest, so let the weary rest; this is your comfort”—but they would not listen.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Therefore, the word of Yahweh will be to them “Do, do this, and do, do that, a rule about this and a rule about that, here a little, there a little,” in order that they will stumble backward and be broken and captured.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Therefore, listen to the word of Yahweh, you scornful jesters—rulers of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For you have said, “We have made a covenant with death and a pact with the underworld, so when the overwhelming scourge sweeps over us, it will not harm us. For we have made lies our refuge and found our shelter in falsehood.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Here’s what the Lord God says: “Behold, I set in place in Zion a Foundation Stone, fully tested and proven to be faithful and secure. And written upon this precious cornerstone is this: ‘Those who trust in him will not act in haste.’</verse>
				<verse number="17">I will set justice as the true measurement and integrity as its plumb line. My hailstorm will sweep away your refuge of lies, and my floodwaters will overwhelm your hiding place.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then your covenant with death will be annulled and your pact with the underworld will not stand. And when the overwhelming scourge sweeps over you, it will sweep you away!</verse>
				<verse number="19">As often as disaster passes by, it will carry you away; morning by morning, day after day, it will sweep you away!” When you fully understand this message, it will bring nothing but terror to you!</verse>
				<verse number="20">Your bed is too short to stretch yourself out on, and your covering is too narrow to wrap yourself in.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The Lord Yahweh will suddenly arise as on Mount Perazim and in the valley of Gibeon. He arises to accomplish his strange work—peculiar as it is— his strange work of judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So do not mock, or your bonds will grow tighter. For I have heard the decree from my Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. He spoke a decree of destruction against the whole land.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Hear my voice, listen to my words, and pay close attention to my parable.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Does a farmer plow continually at planting time and never plant a crop? Does he continually break open the clods of the ground and never sow his seed?</verse>
				<verse number="25">Once he has leveled its surface, does he not sow dill and cumin, planting his wheat in rows, his barley in its proper place, and his rye in a patch?</verse>
				<verse number="26">Yes, his God has instructed him and taught him the right way of farming the land.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Dill, a small seed, is not threshed with a threshing sledge, nor is a wagon wheel rolled over cumin. Dill is beaten with a rod and cumin with a stick.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Grain is crushed and milled for bread, but it is not threshed endlessly. One drives the wagon’s wheels over it, but his horses’ hooves do not pulverize it.</verse>
				<verse number="29">This counsel also comes from Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. For his guidance is unfathomable, and the heavenly wisdom he imparts is magnificent.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="29">
				<verse number="1">“Woe to Ariel —Ariel, the town where David encamped! Go ahead—keep your annual feasts, and year after year celebrate your annual festivals.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I will bring distress to Ariel and there will be great mourning. Jerusalem will be to me as the meaning of the name Ariel —a burning altar hearth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I will lay siege to you on all sides, encircling you with towers and raising up my siege works against you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Brought low, you will speak from the dust of the earth. Your voice will be heard speaking from the ground, and like the voice of a ghost, you will whisper out of the dust.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then suddenly, in an instant, your ruthless enemies will become nothing more than dust in the wind and your vile tyrants like wind-driven chaff!</verse>
				<verse number="6">She will be visited by the Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, with thunder, earthquake, and deafening noise, with whirlwind, tempest, and the blaze of a consuming fire!</verse>
				<verse number="7">As quickly as a fading dream or as fleeting as a vision of the night, so will all the vast hordes of all the nations fade away and all who war against Ariel and her fortress disappear.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Just as a hungry man dreams that he is eating but wakes up still hungry, or as a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking but wakes up weak and still longing for water, so it will be for the vast hordes of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Be totally shocked and amazed by what I am about to say to you: “Blind yourselves—and be totally blind! (They are drunk but not from wine. They stagger but not from hard liquor.)</verse>
				<verse number="10">For Yahweh has poured out over you the spirit of a deep, deep sleep — putting the covers over your slumbering seers and rocking all your prophets to sleep.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">This entire prophetic revelation will become to you like the words of a sealed book. If it’s given to one who can read it with the command “Read this,” he responds, “I can’t because it is sealed.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Or if it’s given to one who is illiterate with the command “Read this,” he responds, “I can’t because I cannot read.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">This is what the Lord says about these people: “They come near to me with hollow words and honor me superficially with their lips; all the while their hearts run far away from me! Their worship is nothing more than man-made rules.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So therefore, I will again jolt this people awake with astonishing wonders upon wonders! And the wisdom of their wise ones will fail, and the intelligent know-it-alls will have no explanations.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Woe to you who think you can hide your plan from the Lord Yahweh. Ha! Do you actually think your secret schemes are so hidden that you say, ‘Who sees us doing this? No one knows what we’re doing!’</verse>
				<verse number="16">Oh, how great is your perversion! Who is more intelligent—the potter or the clay? Should a created thing say to its creator, ‘You didn’t make me’? Should a clay pot say to the potter, ‘You don’t understand’?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Before you know it, Lebanon will be transformed into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will seem like a forest.</verse>
				<verse number="18">In that day the deaf will begin to hear the words that have been written, and out of the darkness and gloom, the eyes of the blind will be opened to see.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The meek will overflow with fresh joy in the Lord Yahweh, and the poor will shout their praises to the Holy One of Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="20">For the terrible one will be no more, the scornful jester will not be found, and all the lovers of evil will be cut off.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Those who make the innocent appear guilty, those who ensnare others with deceitful tactics, and those who lie to keep the innocent from getting justice will likewise be destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So now, listen to what Yahweh, the God of Israel, who redeemed Abraham, has to say to Jacob’s tribes: “My people will no longer be disgraced, and their shame-faces will disappear.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For when they see the miracle of the many children that I give them, they will see me as holy and honor me. Yes, they will honor the Holy One of Jacob and stand in awe of the God of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Those who are in spiritual error will come to understanding, and those who are always complaining will be glad to accept instruction.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="30">
				<verse number="1">This is what Yahweh says: “Woe to the rebellious children, who carry out their own plans but not mine, and who sign treaties without consulting my Spirit, piling one sin upon another.</verse>
				<verse number="2">You travel down to Egypt to find help without being guided by the words of my mouth. Instead you put your trust in Pharaoh’s protection, seeking shelter in the shadow of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Therefore, Pharaoh’s protection will become your shame, and the shelter of Egypt’s shadow will end in disaster!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Though your officials arrive at Zoan and your ambassadors reach as far away as Hanes,</verse>
				<verse number="5">all will be put to shame because of such unreliable people. They can offer you no help, only shame and disgrace!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">This is a prophecy of the desert animals: The burden of the caravan is to traverse a desert land of distress and trouble, a land of the lion and lioness, the snake and the fiery flying one! They carry their riches on the donkey’s back and their treasures on the camel’s hump to a nation that will give them nothing in return!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Egypt’s help is utterly worthless; that’s why I nicknamed her Rahab, the Do-Nothing Dragon.</verse>
				<verse number="8">God told me to write down in a book words meant for the coming generation as an eternal witness.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For they are stubborn rebels, children always telling lies, who refuse to listen to Yahweh ’s instruction.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They say to the seers: “Stop seeing your visions.” They say to the prophets: “Stop prophesying to us about what is right. Prophesy only pleasant things to us, even if they’re illusions!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Leave this narrow way; turn aside from this harsh path. Don’t confront us anymore with the Holy One of Israel!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Therefore, this is what the Holy One of Israel has to say: “Because you have despised this message, and trust in your own clever abilities to deceive, and rely upon oppression,</verse>
				<verse number="13">your own sin will become like a high, bulging wall that is cracked and about to collapse. In an instant, it will all fall down.</verse>
				<verse number="14">It will break into pieces like shattered pottery, smashed so ruthlessly that not even a fragment big enough to pick up a hot coal or to scoop water from a cistern will be found!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, says: “Come back to me! By returning and resting in me you will be saved. In quietness and trust you will be made strong. But you refused.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And though you boast, ‘No! We will flee on horses,’ you will indeed flee for your lives! You say, ‘We will ride on swift horses,’ but your pursuers will be swift to chase you!</verse>
				<verse number="17">A thousand will flee at the threat of one, and all will flee at the threat of five, until nothing will be left of you— like a lonely flagstaff on the top of a hill, or like a signpost on a barren mountain!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">For this reason the Lord is still waiting to show his favor to you so he can show you his marvelous love. He waits to be gracious to you. He sits on his throne ready to show mercy to you. For Yahweh is the Lord of justice, faithful to keep his promises. Overwhelmed with bliss are all who will entwine their hearts in him, waiting for him to help them.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yes, the people of Zion who live in Jerusalem will weep no more. How compassionate he will be when he hears your cries for help! He will answer you when he hears your voice!</verse>
				<verse number="20">Even though the Lord may allow you to go through a season of hardship and difficulty, he himself will be there with you. He will not hide himself from you, for your eyes will constantly see him as your Teacher.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When you turn to the right or turn to the left, you will hear his voice behind you to guide you, saying, “This is the right path; follow it.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then you will see your idols as they are—unclean! Your silver-overlaid idols and gold-plated images are defiled. You will discard them like a filthy menstrual cloth, saying to them, “Good riddance!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then God will supply you with abundant rain for the seeds you sow. He will bless you with an incredible, plentiful harvest. And in that day he will give you lush, broad pastures for your cattle.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Even your oxen and donkeys that work the soil will feed on good grain, separated from its chaff.</verse>
				<verse number="25">On the day of great slaughter, when all their towers tumble, God will bless you with sparkling streams and bubbling brooks flowing down every high hill and every lofty mountain.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Moonlight will shine as bright as sunlight, and the sun’s glare will become seven times brighter, like the light of seven days rolled into one. That will be the day when the Lord Yahweh heals the bruises and wounds that he has inflicted.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Look! Here comes Yahweh with his mighty power and glory! He comes in his awesome splendor with thick clouds! Consumed with anger, his lips are filled with fury, and his words are a devouring fire!</verse>
				<verse number="28">His breath is as overwhelming as a flooding river reaching up to the neck. He sifts the nations in his sieve of destruction and places a bridle in their jaws that causes them to wander.</verse>
				<verse number="29">But you will have a joyous song throughout the night, as one celebrating a holy, consecrated feast. You will have gladness of heart, as one celebrating to the sound of a flute and dancing up the mountain of Yahweh, the Rock who shelters Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="30">And Yahweh will cause everyone to hear his awe-inspiring, majestic voice. He will open their eyes to see his mighty power coming down with raging anger and consuming fire! His power will descend in cloudburst, thunderstorm, and hail.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And when his rod strikes the Assyrians, they will be terror-stricken by the mighty voice of Lord Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Every stroke of Yahweh ’s punishing rod will be to the sound of cymbals and strumming harps. God himself fights them in battle with dancing!</verse>
				<verse number="33">From long ago, the king’s fiery burial place has been prepared, stacked high with plenty of firewood to fuel the flame. Yahweh ’s breath, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="31">
				<verse number="1">Woe to those who run down to Egypt for help, trusting in the might of their multitude of cavalry, chariots, and riders. Their confident trust is not in the Holy One of Israel, nor do they consult with Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yet he is wiser than all of them! He can call down calamity upon evildoers and never needs to retract his words. He will stand up against the wicked and those who protect them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The Egyptians are not gods; they’re only human! Their horses are not supernatural; they’re only flesh! When Yahweh demonstrates his power, the helper will stumble and the helped will fall— both will perish together!</verse>
				<verse number="4">This is what Yahweh said to me: “When a lion, the great beast, growls over his prey, and when the shepherds band together against him, the lion is neither terrified by their shouts nor disturbed by all the noise they make. So will Yahweh, the Commander of Angel Armies, come down to fight for you on Mount Zion and on Zion’s hill!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Just as a bird hovers over its nest to protect its young, so will Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, shield Jerusalem. He will protect her, deliver her, spare her, and rescue her!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">“People of Israel! Repent and turn back to God, whom you have deeply betrayed.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For a time is coming when all people will throw away their sinful idols of silver and gold and forsake all that their own hands have made.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Assyria will fall by the sword but not the sword of man. It will not be man’s sword that will slaughter them, but God’s! They will run from battle, and their young men will be made slaves.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Fear will cause them to surrender their high fortress, and they will panic at the sight of princes, and desert their battle flag,” says the Lord God, whose fire burns in Zion and whose furnace burns in Jerusalem!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="32">
				<verse number="1">Look—a new era begins! A king will reign with righteousness, and his princes according to justice!</verse>
				<verse number="2">A man will be a hiding place from the stormy wind and a secret shelter from the tempest. Life will flow from each one, like streams of water in the desert, like the refreshing shade of a massive rock in a weary, thirsty land.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then at last, eyes that are ready to see will finally be opened! Ears that are ready to hear will finally be opened!</verse>
				<verse number="4">The hearts of those who were once hasty to form opinions will finally understand and know. And those with stammering tongues will speak dazzling truths!</verse>
				<verse number="5">The fool will no longer be called Your Honor, nor the scoundrel highly respected,</verse>
				<verse number="6">for the fool is recognized by his foolish words. Their minds plot treachery, they excel in ungodliness, and they say misleading things about Yahweh. They refuse to feed the hungry or give drink to the thirsty.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The deceiver’s schemes and plans are evil. He schemes of cheating the poor, even when their plea is just.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But a person of honor has honorable plans, and his integrity gives him security.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You careless women, it is time to get up and hear my voice. You complacent daughters, pay attention to what I say.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Although you are carefree now, you will tremble for many days and years, for your grape harvest will fail and your fruit harvest will not come!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Tremble, you careless ones. Take off your fine garments and expose yourselves. Shake with fear and put on sackcloth.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Beat your breasts in sorrow for your pleasant fields and fruitful vines.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Mourn for the soil of my people, for it will grow nothing but thorns and briars. Yes, mourn for all the houses of joy in the joyous city,</verse>
				<verse number="14">for the bustling city with its mansions will be deserted. The high ground and watchtower will be empty, becoming the joy of wild donkeys and a grazing ground for flocks.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The desolation will not end until the Spirit is poured out upon us from heaven! Then the wilderness will blossom into a fruitful orchard and the trees of the orchard will grow into a forest!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then justice will reside in the wilderness and righteousness will dwell in the fruitful orchard.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The work of righteousness is peace, and the result of righteousness is quietness and confidence forever.</verse>
				<verse number="18">My people will live free from worry in secure homes and quiet resting places.</verse>
				<verse number="19">No matter if hail destroys the forest and the city is leveled,</verse>

				<verse number="1">Woe to you, destroyer, you who have not been destroyed. Woe to you, traitor, you who have not been betrayed. When you have finished your work of destroying, you will be destroyed, and when you have completed your betrayal, you will be betrayed.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh, be gracious to us, for we wait for you. Be our strength every morning and rescue us when troubles come.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The nations retreat at the sound of your roaring voice. The nations scatter as you arise in your majesty.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Their spoil will be harvested, carried away like locusts that strip a field bare. And like leaping locusts, men will leap upon the spoils.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yahweh is high and lifted up; he dwells on high! He lavished his justice and righteousness on Zion!</verse>
				<verse number="6">He will be your constant source of stability in changing times, and out of his abundant love he gives you the riches of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. Yes, the fear of the Lord is the key to this treasure!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Listen! The valiant ones cry in the streets and envoys of peace weep bitterly.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The highways are deserted and the travelers have disappeared. Covenants are broken and witnesses rejected, and no one is respected.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The land mourns and languishes. Lebanon is disgraced and withered. The fields of Sharon are like a desert. The lands of Bashan and Carmel are stripped bare.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Now I will arise,” says the Lord. “Now I will exalt myself; now I will unveil my majesty!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Assyria, your plans are worthless, as useless as chaff. My breath will be a fire that consumes you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As a thorn bush is cut down and thrown into the fire, your nation will be burned to ashes of lime.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“You who are far away, listen to what I have done, and you who draw near to me, acknowledge my power and strength!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Sinners in Zion are afraid, and the godless are gripped with panic, saying, ‘Who can dwell with such an all-consuming fire? Who can live in the presence of the never-ending flame?’</verse>
				<verse number="15">Only those who walk with integrity and speak what is true, who despise even the thought of cheating the poor, and do not accept a bribe, nor plot violence, nor contemplate doing evil —</verse>
				<verse number="16">they will live safely on the heights and make their safe place the mountain strongholds, with bread in steady supply and water assured.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">In this high place, your eyes will see the king in his stunning beauty and gaze upon his broad domain.</verse>
				<verse number="18">You will look back on the fears of your past and say, “Now, where is the scholar? Where is the adviser? Where is the one who numbers those who are maturing?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">You will no longer see the defiant foreigner who speaks a strange, incomprehensible language.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Set your gaze on Zion, the city where we gather for Yahweh ’s feasts. Your eyes will see Jerusalem as a quiet, pleasant place. It is a secure dwelling, permanent and unmovable, not like a tabernacle that must be taken down, its pegs pulled up, and transported.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Glorious Yahweh will be there for us in a land with broad rivers and life-giving streams, where the hostile, majestic ships will not sail.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The Lord Yahweh is our Judge, our Lawgiver, and our King; he will save us completely!</verse>
				<verse number="23">Your ropes hang loose, your mast is not secure, and your sail is not unfurled. Then there will be a great plunder, such an abundant treasure divided that even the lame will seize their rich share.</verse>
				<verse number="24">No one living in Zion will say, “I am sick,” for all who live there will have their sin forgiven.</verse>

			<chapter number="34">
				<verse number="1">Come close to me, you nations, and listen! Pay attention to me, you peoples! Let all the world hear me, the earth and all that springs from it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For Yahweh has turned his anger toward the nations and his fury against all their armies. He has doomed them to destruction and will annihilate them all.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Their slain will be cast out, the stench of their corpses will rise, and the mountains will stream with their blood.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The heavenly powers will fade away to nothing, and the heavens will be rolled up like a scroll. All their mighty host will wither as leaves fall from a withered vine or fruit from a withering fig tree.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The Lord says: “Indeed, my judgment-sword has appeared in the heavens, and when it has drunk its fill, you will see it descend on the people of Edom, those whom I have doomed to judgment.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Lord Yahweh has a judgment-sword dripping with blood. It is smeared with fat, dripping with the blood of lambs and goats, and covered with the fat of rams’ kidneys. Lord Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Cattle and young bulls will also be slain; their land will be drenched with blood and the dust soaked with fat.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For Lord Yahweh has a day of vengeance, a year of vindication for Zion’s cause.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Edom’s streams will be turned to pitch and its soil to sulfur; her land will become blazing pitch.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Night and day it will never be extinguished; its smoke will go up forever and ever. Through the endless ages it will lie desolate; no one will pass through it forever.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Nothing but desert hawks and wild animals will live there; owls and ravens will find a home there. The Lord will stretch out over it a measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of emptiness.</verse>
				<verse number="12">It will be named No Kingdom There, and all its rulers and princes will come to nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Its palaces will be overgrown with thorns, its fortresses with thistles and briars. It will become a haunt for demons and an abode for owls.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Wild beasts will mingle with wolves and goat-demons will howl to one another. There too the night-demon will settle in and find her rest.</verse>
				<verse number="15">There the arrow-snake will build her nest, lay her eggs, and hatch her brood in the shadows. There too the vultures will gather to breed.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Seek for Yahweh ’s book and read it carefully. You will learn that none of these prophecies will fail; none will lack a fulfillment as its companion. For the Lord has issued his decree. It is his Spirit that has gathered them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He is the one who apportioned it to them by lot, whose hand measured the share of each. They will possess it for all time and dwell there throughout the ages.</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="36">
				<verse number="1">In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and conquered them.</verse>
				<verse number="2">After defeating Lachish, Sennacherib sent his chief commander with his massive army from there to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. He took up a position on the road to the Washerman’s Field, at the end of the aqueduct where it empties into the upper pool.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And coming out to meet him were three officials of the king: Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna, the scribe; and Joah, son of Asaph, the secretary.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Sennacherib’s commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah, this is what the exalted king, the king of Assyria, says: ‘What makes you so confident?</verse>
				<verse number="5">You think you have a strategy and defensive might, but mere words are no match for my army! In whom are you trusting for help that you rebel against me?</verse>
				<verse number="6">I know—you are relying on Egypt, that broken staff full of splinters. If anyone leans on it, it will pierce his hand. Pharaoh himself, king of Egypt, is like that splintered staff to those who put their trust in him! But you tell me that you are trusting in Yahweh, your God. For Hezekiah went around destroying every sacred altar from the land. Didn’t he insist that Judah and Jerusalem had to worship only at this altar in your temple?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now it’s time to make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses if you’re able to come up with as many men to ride them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You’re no match against even one officer of the least of my master’s officials! Why put your confidence in Egypt’s chariots and horsemen?</verse>
				<verse number="10">What’s more, do you really think I’ve marched against this land to destroy it on my own without Yahweh ’s approval?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah replied, “Please speak to us, your servants, in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew, for the people on the wall are listening to us, and they will overhear our conversation.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">But the commander answered them, “Do you think I came to deliver this message from my master only to you and your king? It is also meant for the men sitting there on the wall to hear! They are the ones who will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So the commander stood and shouted out in a loud voice in Hebrew to the men listening on the wall, “Hear the words of the great King Sennacherib, the king of Assyria,</verse>
				<verse number="14">for he has sent me with these words: ‘Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you, for there is nothing he can do to save you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Don’t be deceived when he tries to persuade you to trust in Yahweh, saying to you, “ Yahweh will come to our rescue and our city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for the king of Assyria says to you, “Make your peace with me and surrender so that you may continue to eat from your own grapes and figs and drink the water from your own cisterns</verse>
				<verse number="17">until I come and take you away to a land like your own. It is a good land of grain and wine, bread and vineyards.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Don’t be deceived by Hezekiah’s empty words when he says to you, “ Yahweh will save us.” Has any god ever saved a nation from the mighty hand of the king of Assyria?</verse>
				<verse number="19">Where were the gods of Hamath and Arphad? Where were the gods of Sepharvaim? Did any god save your northern kingdom of Samaria from me?</verse>
				<verse number="20">Where is there a god that could save its people from my mighty hand?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="21">But they were silent, and no one answered him a word, for King Hezekiah had ordered them, “Do not answer him.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">So the three officials of Hezekiah—Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna, the scribe; and Joah, son of Asaph the secretary—came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn as a sign of despair and reported what the Assyrian commander had said.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="37">
				<verse number="1">When Hezekiah heard what the commander had said, he tore his robe, put on sackcloth, and went to the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And he sent Eliakim, the palace administrator; Shebna, the royal scribe; and the leading priests—all clothed in sackcloth—to the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They told him, “Here is Hezekiah’s message: ‘This is a day of great anguish, rebuke, and humiliation. We are desperate, as in the day a woman is in heavy labor but has no strength left to give birth.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Perhaps Lord Yahweh, your God, will take note of all the blasphemous words of the Assyrian commander who was sent by his master, the king of Assyria, to ridicule the living God. And may Lord Yahweh, your God, rebuke him for the words he heard him speak. So therefore, we come to ask you to pray for us, the remnant that still survives.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Isaiah answered the king’s delegation, saying, “Tell your master these words: ‘Here is what Lord Yahweh says about this matter: “Don’t fear or be frightened by the blasphemous words of the servants of the king of Assyria.</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">I will put in him a mindset that will cause him, when he hears a certain rumor, to flee back to his own country. And when he returns I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.” ’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Meanwhile, the Assyrian commander returned to the king, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish to lay siege against the city of Libnah.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now, King Sennacherib had heard a report that the king of Ethiopia, Tirhakah, had allied with Hezekiah and was coming to fight against him. So when he heard it he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this message:</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Don’t let this God in whom you trust mislead you into thinking that Jerusalem will not fall and be delivered into the hand of the mighty king of Assyria.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Certainly you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them all. Do you really think you’ll be delivered?</verse>
				<verse number="12">Did any of their gods come to their rescue? Where were the gods of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden, who were in Tel Azzar when my predecessors destroyed their lands?</verse>
				<verse number="13">Tell me, where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arphad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivva?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">When the messengers delivered Sennacherib’s message to Hezekiah, he read it and immediately went into the temple of Yahweh and spread it out before the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And he prayed:</verse>
				<verse number="16">“O  Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, the God of Israel, you are enthroned between the wings of the cherubim and you reign supreme as God over all the kingdoms of the world, for you alone are Creator of heaven and earth.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Please lean down to hear my prayer. Yahweh, open your eyes and see me here calling out to you. Listen carefully to every blasphemous word Sennacherib has sent to ridicule and insult you, the living God.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Lord Yahweh, truly the Assyrian kings have annihilated all these nations and conquered their lands.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They smashed and burned their gods, for they’re not truly gods but mere idols made by human hands shaped from wood and stone. That’s why they could be destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So now, our loving God, Yahweh, save us from the Assyrians so that the whole world will know that you alone are Yahweh, Lord God Almighty.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then Isaiah, son of Amoz, sent this message to Hezekiah: “Hear the words of Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Because you prayed to me about the taunts of Sennacherib, king of Assyria,</verse>
				<verse number="22">this is what I, Yahweh, decree concerning him: “ ‘The virgin daughter of Zion despises you and ridicules you. My daughter, Jerusalem, tosses her head back and makes fun of you!</verse>
				<verse number="23">Whom do you think you’re mocking and blaspheming? Against whom do you raise your voice? And whom have you looked down upon in your arrogance? None other than me, the Holy One of Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="24">You sent your messengers to mock the Lord. You boast, “My vast number of chariots has taken me up the highest mountains, to the heights of Lebanon’s forests. I cut down its loftiest cedars, its choicest cypresses. I ascended its highest peak and claimed its great forests.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I dug wells and drank foreign water. The feet of my armies trampled the Nile delta dry.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">“ ‘Have you not learned that I planned all this long ago? Yes, from ages past I planned it, and now I fulfill it, that you would conquer fortified cities and turn them into piles of stones.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The inhabitants were frightened and ashamed. They became as fragile as weeds and tender grass, as short-lived as the grass that grows on the rooftop and is scorched before the east wind.</verse>
				<verse number="28">I know where you live, every movement you make, all that you do, and your rage against me.</verse>
				<verse number="29">I have heard your arrogant words, and because you rage against me, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.</verse>
				<verse number="30">“ ‘Hezekiah, this will be a sign for you: This year you will eat only grain that grows of itself. Next year you will eat what comes of that. Then, in the third year, life will be normal again. You will sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Judah’s remnant will flourish again, sending deep roots into the ground and bearing luscious fruit above,</verse>
				<verse number="32">for a remnant will go out from Mount Zion and Jerusalem. The fiery passion of Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will accomplish this!</verse>
				<verse number="33">“ ‘Therefore, here is what I, Yahweh, have to say about the king of Assyria: He will neither enter this city, nor shoot even one arrow here, nor raise a warrior’s shield, nor build a siege ramp against Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="34">I declare that by the way he came, by that same way he will leave. He will not set foot in the city.</verse>
				<verse number="35">I promise to defend this city and protect it, for the sake of my own honor and for the sake of David, my loving servant.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="36">That night the angel of Yahweh came into the Assyrian camp and slaughtered 185,000 soldiers. When morning dawned, there were only dead bodies in the enemy’s camp!</verse>
				<verse number="37">Sennacherib, the great king of Assyria, left, returning the same way he came, and retreated to Nineveh, the Assyrian capital.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then one day, as he was worshiping in the temple of his god, Nisroch, his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, entered the temple and killed him with swords. They escaped into the land of Ararat and the king’s son Esar-haddon succeeded him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="38">
				<verse number="1">Now, Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, came and prophesied to him, saying, “This is what Yahweh has to say to you: Set your affairs in order, for you will not recover from this illness. You are going to die.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then Hezekiah broke down and wept, turned his face to the wall, and prayed, “O please, Yahweh, please. I beg you, let me live.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Remember how I have walked faithfully before your face. With all my heart, I have sought to do only what is good in your eyes.” Bitter tears streamed down his face.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Isaiah received another prophetic word for Hezekiah. Yahweh said to him,</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Go deliver this message to Hezekiah: ‘This is what Yahweh, the God of your ancestor David, has to say to you: I have heard your heartfelt prayer and I have seen you cry tear after bitter tear. I will give you another fifteen years.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I will defend Jerusalem, and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria.</verse>
				<verse number="7">This will be a sign to you from Yahweh as a confirmation that I will do for you what I have promised.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I will cause the sun’s shadow to retreat ten steps on the stairway of Ahaz.’ ” Then the sunlight went back up the ten steps it had gone down.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Here is the poem of Hezekiah, king of Judah, which he wrote when he was healed from his illness:</verse>
				<verse number="10">I was dying in the prime of life. I thought, “Must I leave this world now? Must I go through the gates of death and miss out on the rest of my years?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">I thought, “I won’t get to see Yah again in the land of the living. No longer will I see my friends or family nor enjoy the company of anyone living on earth.</verse>
				<verse number="12">My body is being folded up and taken from me, taken down like a shepherd’s tent. He cuts my life short, as a weaver cuts his cloth from the loom and rolls it up. From day to night, you bring my life to an end.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I felt as though a lion were crushing all my bones as I cried out for help until morning. From day to night, you bring my life to an end.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I could only chirp like a swallow or small bird; I could only moan like a dove. My eyes are weary from looking up into heaven. Yahweh, I am so depressed. Come and be my strength.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But what can I say? For he has spoken to me and told me that he is the one who has done this. I can’t sleep a wink because I’m overwhelmed with grief.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Lord, it is because of your kindness that life is given. It is in you that my spirit lives. Now restore my health and give me life again!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Truly, it was for my own good that I had this bitter experience. For you loved my soul out of the pit of oblivion. You cast all my sins behind your back.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The grave and those buried there cannot praise you. Neither the realm of death nor those who enter it can give you thanks or hope for your faithfulness.</verse>
				<verse number="19">It’s the living who thank you as I do today. One generation makes your faithfulness known to the next.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yahweh is pleased to heal me and save me! We will sing to the music of stringed instruments every day of our lives in Yahweh ’s house.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Now, Isaiah had said to Hezekiah, “Have the physicians apply a poultice of cakes of dried figs to your boil, and you will recover.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">And Hezekiah had said, “What will be the sign from God that I will be healed and go up again to worship in Yahweh ’s house?”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="39">
				<verse number="1">Shortly after Hezekiah was healed of his illness, the king of Babylon, Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, heard that King Hezekiah had been deathly ill and had recovered. So he sent envoys carrying letters and a lavish gift.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Delighted by the king’s gesture, and having a desire to impress them, Hezekiah welcomed the envoys from Babylon and opened the doors of the king’s storehouses of treasures and showed them to the envoys. He let them see all of his gold, silver, spices, and costly fragrant oils, as well as his entire armory. All of the king’s royal treasures, all that was in the king’s palace, and all the wealth of his whole kingdom was shown to them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Isaiah the prophet visited the king and said to him, “ What have you done? What did these men say and where did they come from?” Hezekiah replied, “They are envoys from distant Babylon.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Isaiah asked, “What did they see in your palace?” “They have seen everything in my palace,” responded Hezekiah. “I showed them everything in my royal treasuries.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Here is what Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has to say to you:</verse>
				<verse number="6">‘The days are coming when all the treasures in your palace and all the wealth that your ancestors have stored up until this day will be carried off to Babylon; absolutely nothing will be left,’ says the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="7">‘Some of your own sons who come after you will be deported and become high officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word Yahweh has spoken through you is good and right.” For he thought, “At least for me, there will be peace and security in my lifetime.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="40">
				<verse number="1">Your God says to you: “Comfort, comfort my people with gentle, compassionate words.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Speak tenderly from the heart to revive those in Jerusalem, and proclaim that their warfare is over. Her debt of sin is paid for, and she will not be treated as guilty. Prophesy to her that she has received from the hand of Yahweh twice as many blessings as all her sins.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">A thunderous voice cries out in the wilderness: “Prepare the way for Yahweh ’s arrival! Make a highway straight through the desert for our God!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Every valley will be raised up, every mountain brought low. The rugged terrain will become level ground and the rough places a plain.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Yahweh ’s radiant glory will be unveiled, and all humanity will experience it together. Believe it, for Yahweh has spoken his decree!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">A voice says, “Cry out!” And I ask, “What should I say?” “All people are as frail as grass, and their elegance is like a wilting wildflower.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The grass withers, the flower fades when the breath of Yahweh blows upon it; the people are just like grass!</verse>
				<verse number="8">But even though grass withers and the flower fades, the word of our God stands strong forever!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Go up on a high mountain, you joyful messengers of Zion, and lift up your voices with power. You who proclaim joyous news to Jerusalem, shout it out and don’t be afraid. Say to the cities of Judah, “Here is your God!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Look! Here comes Lord Yahweh as a victorious warrior; he triumphs with his awesome power. Watch as he brings with him his reward and the spoils of victory to give to his people.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He will care for you as a shepherd tends his flock, gathering the weak lambs and taking them in his arms. He carries them close to his heart and gently leads those that have young.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Who has measured the waters of the sea in the hollow of his hand and used his hand-width to mark off the heavens? Who knows the exact weight of all the dust of the earth and has weighed all the mountains and hills on his scale?</verse>
				<verse number="13">Who fully understands the Spirit of Yahweh or is wise enough to counsel him?</verse>
				<verse number="14">Whom does he consult to be enlightened? Who teaches him the ways of justice? Who imparts knowledge to him or shows him the true path of wisdom?</verse>
				<verse number="15">Even the nations are to him like a drop in a bucket, regarded as nothing more than dust on a scale. He picks up the islands like fine grains of sand.</verse>
				<verse number="16">All of Lebanon’s trees are not enough firewood for him, nor are all its animals enough for a burnt offering.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The nations are nothing in his eyes; he regards them as absolutely nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Who even comes close to being compared to God? How could you ever compare God to an idol?</verse>
				<verse number="19">A craftsman forms an idol-god, then a goldsmith overlays it with gold and forges its silver chains.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The one who is poor and cannot afford silver or gold chooses a tree that will not rot, then seeks a skilled workman to make an idol that will not topple.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Don’t you realize that God is the Creator? Don’t you hear the truth? Haven’t you been told this from the beginning? Haven’t you understood this since he laid a firm foundation for the earth?</verse>
				<verse number="22">He sits enthroned high above the circle of the earth; to him the people of earth are like grasshoppers! He stretches out the heavens like a curtain, spreading it open like a tent to live in.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He reduces rulers to nothing and makes the elite of the earth as nothing at all.</verse>
				<verse number="24">They barely get planted and barely take root in their position of power when the Lord blows on them and they wither away, carried off like straw in the stormy wind.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The Holy One asks: “Can you find anyone or anything to compare to me? Where is the one equal to me?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Lift up your eyes to the sky and see for yourself. Who do you think created the cosmos? He lit every shining star and formed every glowing galaxy, and stationed them all where they belong. He has numbered, counted, and given each one a name. They shine because of God’s incredible power and awesome might; not one fails to appear!</verse>
				<verse number="27">Why, then, O Jacob’s tribes, would you ever complain? And my chosen Israel, why would you say, “ Yahweh isn’t paying attention to my situation. He has lost all interest in what happens to me”?</verse>
				<verse number="28">Don’t you know? Haven’t you been listening? Yahweh is the one and only everlasting God, the Creator of all you can see and imagine! He never gets weary or worn out. His intelligence is unlimited; he is never puzzled over what to do!</verse>
				<verse number="29">He empowers the feeble and infuses the powerless with increasing strength.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Even young people faint and get exhausted; athletic ones may stumble and fall.</verse>
				<verse number="31">But those who entwine their hearts with Yahweh will experience divine strength. They will rise up on soaring wings and fly like eagles, run their races without growing weary, and walk through life without giving up.</verse>

				<verse number="1">“You lands of the sea, stand silent before me! Let the people renew their strength! Let them approach me and state their case. Let’s come together to decide who is right.</verse>

				<verse number="3">Swiftly he pursues them and advances unscathed as he passes over unfamiliar land.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Who achieved all this and made it happen? Who guides the destiny of each generation from the first until now? I am the one! I am Yahweh, the first, the unchanging one who will be there in the end!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The islands see it and panic; the ends of the earth tremble; they approach and draw near.</verse>

				<verse number="17">“I, Yahweh, will respond to the cry of the poor and needy when they are thirsty and their tongues are parched with thirst! When they seek a drink of water but there is none, I, the God of Israel, will not abandon them.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I will open up refreshing streams on the barren hills and springing fountains in the valleys. I will make the desert a pleasant pool and the dry land springs of water.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I will plant in the treeless desert cedars and acacias, myrtle and olive trees. I will set in the wilderness evergreens, together with many elms and cypresses.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Everyone will see and know that I, Yahweh, with my mighty hands have done this. They will consider and comprehend that the Holy One of Israel has created it.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yahweh says, “Present your case.” “Let’s hear your arguments,” says the King of Jacob’s tribes.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“ Come, you idols, and let’s hear your prophecy for the future. Tell us, tell us about your former prophecies so we can test them and see if they were fulfilled, or decree some future event for us.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Prophesy what the future holds to prove to us that you are gods. Do something—anything! Frighten us or put us in awe!</verse>
				<verse number="24">But you are nothing at all! What have you ever accomplished? Whoever chooses to worship you is disgusting!</verse>
				<verse number="25">“I stirred up one from the north, who comes from the rising of the sun. He will call on my name. He will trample rulers into the mud as a potter treads clay.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Which of you foretold this from the start? Who prophesied it from long ago that we can say, ‘He is right’? None of you prophesied it! None of you announced it ahead of time! No one heard you say a thing about it!</verse>
				<verse number="27">I was the first to decree to Zion, ‘Look, this is what’s about to happen!’ I am bringing a messenger to Jerusalem with good news.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But when I look, I find no one who is capable to counsel me! There is no one who can respond to me with the right answer! Who could I even ask?</verse>
				<verse number="29">Look, all these gods are nothingness! What have they ever accomplished? Their metal images are nothing but empty wind and confusion!</verse>

				<verse number="1">“Take a good look at my servant! I love him dearly, for he is my chosen one. I have taken hold of him in my strength, and I have clothed him with my Spirit. He will cause justice to spring up for the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He will be gentle and will not quarrel with others in public. He will not exalt his own voice.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He would never crush a broken heart nor disregard the weak and vulnerable. He will make sure justice comes to those who are wronged.</verse>
				<verse number="4">His inner being will not become faint or discouraged, nor will his light grow dim before he establishes justice on the earth. Even the distant lands beyond the seas will hunger for his instruction.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Here are the words of the true God, Yahweh, the one who created the starry heavens and stretched them out. He is the one who formed the earth and filled it with life. He gives breath to every person and spirit to everyone everywhere.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“I, Yahweh, have commissioned you in righteousness to succeed. I will take your hand in love and watch over you. I will give you as a covenant for the people, a walking-light to the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Your mission is to open blind eyes, to set prisoners free from dark dwellings, and to open prison doors to those who are held by darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I am Yahweh; that is my name. I will not give my glory to another god nor my renown to idols.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Don’t you see that what I have prophesied has come to pass? And now I am foretelling the future. I declare it to you before it sprouts up.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Sing to Yahweh a brand-new song! Sing his praise until it echoes from the ends of the earth! Sailors and sea creatures, praise him! Islands and all their inhabitants, sing his praise!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Let the desert and its villages lift their voices in praise! Let the tent villages of Kedar shout their praises! Let the residents of Sela’s cliffs shout with glee, with a celebration shout from the mountaintops!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Let them give Yahweh the glorious praise he deserves and declare his praise in the islands!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh goes out to battle like a hero and stirs up his passion and zeal like a mighty warrior. Yes, his God-shout is a mighty battle cry; he will triumph heroically over all his foes.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For a long time, I said nothing. I restrained myself and kept silent. Now I will groan, pant, and gasp like a woman in labor.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I will level their hills and mountains and dry up all their vegetation. I will turn rivers into islands and dry up their lakes.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I will walk the blind by an unknown way and guide them on paths they’ve never traveled. I will smooth their difficult road and make their dark mysteries bright with light. These are things I will do for them, for I will never abandon my beloved ones.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But those who trust in idols, who say to their metal images, “You are our gods,” will be turned aside in total disgrace.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Hear me, you deaf! Look up, you blind, and see!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Who is as blind as my servant Israel or as deaf as the messenger I send? Who is as blind as my covenant friend, as blind as Yahweh ’s servant?</verse>
				<verse number="20">Israel, you have seen so much, but you don’t get it! You have been taught so much, but what did you really hear?</verse>
				<verse number="21">For the sake of his righteousness, Yahweh was eager to exalt his law and make it glorious.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But this is a people plundered and robbed, trapped in holes and hidden in houses of bondage. They are like prey that no one will rescue, like spoil with no one to say, “Bring them back!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Doesn’t anyone understand this? Will any of you pay attention to this in the future?</verse>
				<verse number="24">Who gave up Jacob to looters and Israel to robbers? It was Yahweh himself, against whom we sinned by not walking in holy ways nor heeding holy words.</verse>
				<verse number="25">So he poured out the heat of his anger and they suffered the fury of war. His anger enveloped them in flames, but they still did not understand— consumed by fire yet they did not take it to heart.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="43">
				<verse number="1">Now, this is what Yahweh says: “ Listen, Jacob, to the One who created you, Israel, to the one who shaped who you are. Do not fear, for I, your Kinsman-Redeemer, will rescue you. I have called you by name, and you are mine.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When you pass through the deep, stormy sea, you can count on me to be there with you. When you pass through raging rivers, you will not drown. When you walk through persecution like fiery flames, you will not be burned; the flames will not harm you,</verse>
				<verse number="3">for I am your Savior, Yahweh, your mighty God, the Holy One of Israel! I give up Egypt as the price to set you free, Cush and Seba in exchange to bring you back.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Since you are cherished and precious in my eyes, and because I love you dearly and want to honor you, I willingly give up nations in exchange for you— a man to save your life.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I am with you now, even close to you, so never yield to fear. I will bring your children from the east; from the west I will gather you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I will say to the north, ‘Hand them over!’ and to the south, ‘Don’t hold them back!’ Bring me my sons from far away, my daughters from the ends of the earth!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Bring me everyone who is called by my name, the ones I created to experience my glory. I myself formed them to be who they are and made them for my glory.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Lead out those who have eyes but are blind, those who have ears but are deaf.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Let all the nations gather together and the people assemble. Which of their gods prophesied this? Which of them foretold what is about to happen? Let them bring out their witnesses to make their case; let them take the stand and testify, “It is true.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yahweh says, “You are my witnesses, my chosen servants. I chose you in order that you would know me intimately, believe me always, and fully understand that I am the only God. There was no god before me, and there will be no other god after me.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I, only I, am Yahweh, and there is no Savior-God but me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I am the only one who revealed this to you. I saved you, foretold the future, and brought it to pass. It was not some foreign god who did this! You are my witnesses that I am God,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“From the very beginning, I am the only God! No one can be snatched from my hand. When I choose to act, who can reverse it?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">This is what Yahweh, your Kinsman-Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, says: “For your good, I will send for the Babylonians; I will bring them all as fugitives and turn the shouting of the Chaldeans into mourning.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I am Yahweh, your Holy One and your King, the Creator of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yahweh is the one who makes a way in the sea, a pathway in the mighty waters.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He destroyed chariots and horses and all their mighty warriors. They fell, never to rise again— gone forever, snuffed out like a wick. This is what he says:</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Stop dwelling on the past. Don’t even remember these former things.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I am doing something brand new, something unheard of. Even now it sprouts and grows and matures. Don’t you perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness and open up flowing streams in the desert.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Wild beasts, jackals, and owls will glorify me. For I supply streams of water in the desert and rivers in the wilderness to satisfy the thirst of my people, my chosen ones,</verse>
				<verse number="21">so that you, whom I have shaped and formed for myself, will proclaim my praise.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Yet you did not call out to me, O Jacob. Are you so weary of me, O Israel?</verse>
				<verse number="23">You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings or honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you by requiring many grain offerings or wearied you with demands for frankincense.</verse>
				<verse number="24">You did not buy me fragrant calamus reeds or lavish me with the fat of your sacrifices. Instead, you have burdened me with your many sins and wearied me with your evil deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I, yes I, am the One and Only, who completely erases your sins, never to be seen again. I will not remember them again. Freely I do this because of who I am!</verse>
				<verse number="26">Help me remember the past. Let’s debate! Bring me your version to prove your innocence.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Your earliest ancestor sinned, and your spokesmen rebelled against me.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So I brought disgrace on the holy priests of the holy sanctuary and brought destruction to Jacob, humiliation and scorn to Israel.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="44">
				<verse number="1">“Now, listen to me, my servant Jacob, Israel, my chosen one. I am Yahweh, your Creator, who shaped you in my womb. Hear what I have to say to you: ‘Don’t fear. I will help you, O Jacob my servant, Do not fear, my pleasing one, Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">I will pour refreshing water on the thirsty and streams on the dry ground. I will pour out my Spirit on your children, my blessing upon your descendants.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They will spring up like grass blanketing a meadow, like poplars growing by gushing streams.</verse>
				<verse number="5">One will say, “I belong to Yahweh.” Another will be called Jacob. Yet another will write on his hand “Property of Yahweh.” Another will adopt the name Israel.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">The words of Yahweh, Israel’s true King and Kinsman-Redeemer, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says: “I am the Beginning and I am the Ending, and I am the only God there is.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Who is like me? Go ahead, stand and speak up. I’ll wait for him to announce it and explain it all to me! Who else has announced from everlasting what is to come? Let him prophesy what is yet to be.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Do not fear nor be shaken! Haven’t I foretold it, announcing it to you ahead of time? You are my witnesses, so tell me, is there any god besides me? There is no other Rock of shelter; I know not one.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Idol-makers amount to nothing, and the things they treasure can do no one any good. They are witnesses with blind eyes who know nothing; they will be disgraced.</verse>
				<verse number="10">What kind of person would form an idol-god or cast an image with no ability to do any good?</verse>
				<verse number="11">No wonder those who worship them will be put to shame. Their craftsmen are only human beings. Let them all come together and take their stand. They will all be terrified and put to shame!</verse>
				<verse number="12">The blacksmith takes his tongs and heats it over the coals, forming it with hammers, forging it with his strong arm. But when he gets hungry, his strength ebbs away, and if he doesn’t drink water, he quickly grows weary.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The woodworker stretches out a measuring line, then marks it and fashions his idol-god with his carving tools. Then he uses a stylus to trace it out on the wood and shapes it into the figure of a man, trying to make it look like a beautiful human to be displayed somewhere in a shrine.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He chooses a cedar or a cypress or an oak, but first lets it grow strong in the forest. He plants a pine tree, and it is nourished by the rain.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The wood serves man for fuel; some he uses to warm himself and with some he bakes his bread. But from this same wood he also makes a god to worship and bows down to the idol he formed.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Half of the wood he burns in the fire to roast his meat. Then he eats his fill and is satisfied. Part he uses to warm himself and says, “Ah, I’m warm and cozy sitting by the fire.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">With the rest of it he makes his idol-god, bows down to it, and worships it! He prays to it, saying, “Save me, for you are my god!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">They have no clue what they’re doing and don’t comprehend how absurd it is! For they shut their eyes so they cannot see. They close their hearts so they cannot understand.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They have no knowledge, no understanding, no discernment to say, “Half of the wood I burned in the fire. I roasted meat and cooked my dinner. Now should I take the rest of the wood and make it into an abomination? Should I bow down and worship a block of wood?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">He feeds his spirit on ashes! His deluded heart leads him astray. He can’t even ask himself, “Is this thing I’m holding in my right hand a fraud?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Remember these things, O Jacob’s tribes, and Israel, you are my servant. I created you to be my servant, and I will never forget you!</verse>
				<verse number="22">I have swept away your sins like a thick cloud. I have made your guilt vanish like mist disappearing into thin air. Now come back, come back to me, for I have paid the price for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Sing! Starry sky above, break loose with singing, for Yahweh has finished it! Shout! Earth deep below, give up your shout! Mountains high, break out with joyous songs of praise! Let the forest choirs join in, with every tree singing its notes! For Yahweh has paid the ransom price for Jacob’s tribes, and he will be glorified in Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="24">Here is what Yahweh, your Kinsman-Redeemer, who formed you in his womb, has to say: “I am Yahweh, Creator of all. I alone stretched out the canvas of the cosmos. I who shaped the earth needed no one’s help.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now I make fools of fortune-tellers and frustrate astrologers’ predictions. I confuse the wise, who think they know it all, and make their ‘knowledge’ into foolishness.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I confirm the word of my servants and fulfill the prophecies of my messengers. I say to Jerusalem, ‘Many people will live in you again,’ and to the cities of Judah, ‘I will raise up your ruins; you will be rebuilt!’</verse>
				<verse number="27">I say to deep waters, ‘Dry up!’ and to rivers, ‘Become dry!’</verse>
				<verse number="28">I say concerning Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he will carry out all the purposes I have for him,’ saying to Jerusalem, ‘You will be rebuilt and flourish again!’ saying to the temple, ‘You will be reconstructed!’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="45">
				<verse number="1">“This is what Yahweh says to his anointed one, Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped as my servant to conquer nations and dethrone their kings. For I will open doors before him and no fortified gate will remain closed.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“ ‘I will march out in front of you and level every obstacle. I will shatter to pieces bronze doors and slice through iron bars.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I will give you hidden treasures of darkness and wealth waiting in secret sites so that you recognize me, for it is I, Yahweh, the God of Israel, who calls you by your name!</verse>
				<verse number="4">For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name and give you a title of honor. But you don’t even know me.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I am Yahweh, the only God there is, and you’ll never find another. I will strengthen you for victory, even though you do not intimately know who I am.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Yet through you everyone will know who I really am. Those from the rising sun in the east to the west, everyone everywhere will know that I am Yahweh, the one and only God, and there is no other.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I create light, and I make it dark. I make bliss, and I create adversity. I am Yahweh who does all these things.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Shower down righteousness, O heavens above. Let the clouds drip with deliverance! Let earth’s womb open and bear salvation’s fruit, with righteousness rising up beside it! I, Yahweh, have created all of them!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Shame on the one who argues with his Creator, like one clay pot among other pots arguing with the potter. Should the clay say to the potter, ‘What in the world are you doing with me? Your hands are clumsy’?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Shame on the one who complains to a father, ‘Why in the world did you conceive me?’ Or to a mother, ‘Why in the world did you bring me to birth?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Listen to what Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, the One who shaped him, has to say: “Why do you question me about the destiny of my children or tell me what to do with my children and what I have made?</verse>
				<verse number="12">I created the earth and populated it with people. With my own hands, I spread out the cosmos and then commanded the starry host to shine!</verse>
				<verse number="13">I am the one who raised him up in righteousness! I will make all his paths straight and level. He will build my city and release my exiled people, not because he was bribed or hired to do it, declares the Almighty Yahweh!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">This is what Yahweh says to Cyrus: “Egypt’s wealth, Cush’s treasures, and the tall Sabeans will all be handed over to you. In chains they will walk behind you. They will be brought before you and they will bow down and address you reverently, saying, ‘Truly God is with you. He alone is God, and there is no other.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Truly, O God of Israel, the Savior, you are a God who hides himself.</verse>
				<verse number="16">All the idol-makers will be ashamed and disgraced, and each one will walk away in confusion.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But Yahweh saves Israel with everlasting salvation! You will not be put to shame nor disgraced for all eternity!</verse>
				<verse number="18">This is what Yahweh says, heaven’s Creator, who alone is God. He created the earth, shaped it, and established it all by himself. He made it fit and orderly and beautiful for its inhabitants. He says: “I am Yahweh, and there is no other god.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I didn’t whisper in secret, in a realm of darkness. I didn’t say to Jacob’s tribes, ‘Seek me in vain.’ I am Yahweh! I speak the truth and declare to you what is right!</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Come together! Assemble yourselves! Draw near, you refugees from among the nations. Those who parade their powerless wooden idols have no revelation-knowledge. They keep on praying to gods who cannot save them.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Declare what is to be and state your case. Go ahead and take counsel together. Who knew all about this and declared it long ago? Was it not I, Yahweh? There is no god apart from me. I am a righteous God and a Savior. There is no one you can compare to me.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So turn your heart to me, face me now, and be saved wherever you are, even from the ends of the earth, for I alone am God, and there is no other.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I make this solemn oath to you in my own name; this word sent from my mouth in righteousness will not return unfulfilled: ‘Truly every knee will bow before me and every tongue will solemnly swear allegiance to me!’</verse>
				<verse number="24">All will say of me, ‘Yes! Only in Yahweh do I find righteousness and strength!’ And all who were angry with me will come before me and regret it!</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="46">
				<verse number="1">The gods of Babylon, Bel and Nebo, are bowed down and lowered to the ground. They haul away on ox carts their wobbling idols.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They both stoop and bow down, and they are powerless to rescue their own images. There they go—carried off into captivity!</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Listen to me, O Jacob’s tribes, all the remnant of Israel. You never had to carry me, but I have carried you from birth. I supported you from the moment you left the womb.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Even as you grow old and your hair turns gray, I’ll keep carrying you! I am your Maker and your Caregiver. I will carry you and be your Savior.</verse>
				<verse number="5">To whom can you compare me, the incomparable God? Have you found someone else like me?</verse>
				<verse number="6">The wealthy pour out their gold, weigh out their silver in the scales, and hire a goldsmith who crafts it into a ‘god.’ Then they bow down before it to worship it.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They lift it up to their shoulders and have to carry it. They set it on a stand, and there it sits, unable to move from its place. When someone cries out to it, it never answers nor saves anyone from trouble.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Keep this in mind and don’t forget it! Take this to heart, you rebels!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Remember the miracles of long ago. Acknowledge that I am God, and there is no other. I am God, and there is none like me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I declare from the beginning how it will end and foretell from the start what has not yet happened. I decree that my purpose will stand, and I will fulfill my every plan.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I called that eagle Cyrus, swooping in from the east; from a distant land he came, the man of my purpose. I have spoken, and yes, I will bring it to pass. I have formed my plan, and yes, I will do it.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Listen to me, you stubborn ones who are far from righteousness.</verse>

				<verse number="8">“So now, listen to this, you pampered lover of pleasure, who sits smug and secure and says in her heart, ‘I am, and there is no one like me! I will never have to live as a widow or suffer the loss of my children.’</verse>

				<verse number="10">You felt so smug and secure in your wickedness. You thought, ‘No one sees me.’ Your idea of ‘wisdom’ and self-professed ‘knowledge’ has led you astray, saying in your heart, ‘I am! There is none like me!’</verse>
				<verse number="11">An avalanche of evil will come upon you that no magic spell will be able to avert. Great disaster is about to fall upon you that you will not be able to ward off! Total devastation will strike you suddenly. It will happen so swiftly you won’t even see it coming!</verse>

				<verse number="17">This is what Yahweh, your Kinsman-Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel says: “I am Yahweh, your God. I am the One who teaches you how to succeed and who leads you step by step in the way you should go.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If only you had listened to my commands, then peace would have flowed like a river for you and success would wash over you like waves of the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Your children would have multiplied to become like the sand of the seashore and your descendants like grains of sand. There would be no end of them, and I would not cut them off.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Go! Leave Babylon! Flee from Chaldea! Announce it with joyous singing! Let everyone know! Proclaim it to the ends of the earth! Say it loud and clear: “ Yahweh has rescued his servant Jacob!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">The people weren’t thirsty when he led them through barren, desolate deserts, for he broke open the rock for water to flow for them. The rock was split open, and rivers gushed out!</verse>
				<verse number="22">“There is never peace,” Yahweh says, “for the wicked.”</verse>

			<chapter number="49">
				<verse number="1">Listen to what I have to say, you islands. Pay attention to me, you who live in distant lands. Yahweh called me as his own before I was born and named me while I was still in my mother’s womb.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He gives me words that pierce and penetrate. He hid me and protected me in the shadow of his hand. He prepared me like a polished arrow and concealed me in his quiver.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And he said to me, “Israel, you are my special servant; in you I will be glorified.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">I said, “I’ve worked and served for nothing. I have used up all my strength for nothing.” Yet my rights I leave in Yahweh ’s hands, and my just reward is with my God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And now, the Lord Yahweh — who shaped me in the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob’s tribes back to him that Israel would be gathered back to him, for I am honored in the sight of Yahweh. I find the source of all my strength in my God—</verse>
				<verse number="6">who says: “Is it too small a thing for you, my servant, to restore greatness to Jacob’s tribes and the survivors of Israel? I will make you to be a light to the nations and to bring the light of my salvation to the ends of the earth!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yahweh, Israel’s Kinsman-Redeemer and Holy One, says to the one who is deeply despised and repulsed by rulers and a slave to the ruling class: “Kings will see and stand up in respect; princes will bow down to honor the faithfulness of Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh says: “When the time of showing you favor has come, I will answer your heart’s cry. I will help you in the day of salvation, for I have fixed my eyes on you. I have made you a covenant people to restore the land and to resettle families on forgotten inheritances.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You will declare to prisoners, ‘You’re free!’ and to those in darkness, ‘Step out into the light!’ They will be like sheep that graze beside the roads and find pasture on the barren hillside.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They will never be hungry or thirsty. Neither scorching sun nor desert wind will hurt them, for he, the Loving One, will guide them and lead them to restful, renewing streams of water.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I will level all my mountains as a road for them and raise up my highways.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Look! They will come from faraway lands— some from the north, some from the west, and some from the land of Sinim.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Sing for joy, you heavens! Shout, you earth, and rejoice with dancing, shouting, and glee! Burst into joyous songs, you mountains, for Yahweh has comforted his beloved people. He will show tenderness and compassion to his suffering ones.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But Zion has said, “ Yahweh has forsaken me. My Lord has forgotten me— I’m all alone.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh responds, “But how could a loving mother forget her nursing child and not deeply love the one she bore? Even if there is a mother who forgets her child, I could never, no never, forget you.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Can’t you see? I have carved your name on the palms of my hands! Your walls are always my concern.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Your children, your builders, are running back to you as those who ruined and destroyed you are running away.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Lift up your head and look all around you. See! All your children, your builders, gather to come back to you. As surely as I live, I make this promise,” says Yahweh. “You will wear them all like jewels, as a radiant bride wears her beautiful jewelry!</verse>
				<verse number="19">“See? Your ruins and devastated places will soon be overcrowded with settlers while your destroyers stay far away.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You thought you had lost the children, but you will hear them say, ‘This place is too cramped for me. Make more room for me to live in.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">And you will say to yourself, ‘Where in the world did all these children come from? Who birthed these for me? I thought I was bereaved and barren. I thought I was all alone, forgotten in exile— so how did they all get here?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="22">This is what Lord Yahweh says: “Soon I will raise my hand and signal to the nations, and they will come with your little boys bundled in their arms and your little daughters carried on their shoulders.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Kings will be their babysitters and queens their nursing mothers. With faces bowed to the ground, they will lick the dust of your feet. Then you will know that I am Yahweh, and I will never disappoint those who entwine their hearts with mine.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Who can snatch the prey from the hands of a mighty warrior or rescue captives from a conqueror?</verse>
				<verse number="25">But Yahweh says: “The prey will be freed from the mighty warrior, and captives will be rescued from a conqueror! For I will fight with those who fight with you, and I myself will save your children.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I will cause the violence of your oppressors to come back upon them, and your enemies will kill one another in a killing frenzy! Then all the earth will know that I am Yahweh, your Savior, your Kinsman-Redeemer, the mighty hero of Jacob’s tribes.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="50">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh asks, “Have I abandoned you? Can you show me your mother’s divorce papers that prove I sent her away? Do you think I sold you into slavery to pay off a debt? No, you sold yourselves into slavery because of your sins, and because of your rebellion I sent your mother away!</verse>
				<verse number="2">When I came to you, why was no one there? When I called, why did no one answer? Am I powerless to rescue you or too weak to deliver you? With only a threat I can evaporate the sea and dry up the rivers as a desert, leaving the fish to rot and die of thirst.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I dress the sky with darkness and shroud it with sackcloth.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">The Lord Yahweh has equipped me with the anointed, skillful tongue of a teacher — to know how to speak a timely word to the weary. Morning by morning, he awakens my heart. He opens my ears to hear his voice, to be trained to teach.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The Lord Yahweh has opened my ear, and I did not resist; I did not rebel.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I offered my back to those who flogged me and my cheek to those who tore out my beard. I never hid my face from demeaning insults or from those who spit on me.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The Lord Yahweh empowers me, so I am not humiliated. For that reason, with holy determination, I will do his will and not be ashamed.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The One who makes me righteous is close to me. Who would dare challenge me now? Who would be my opponent? Let him stand before me! Who is my accuser? Let him confront me!</verse>
				<verse number="9">It is the Lord Yahweh who empowers me; who would condemn me? My accusers will all fade away like worn-out, moth-eaten clothes.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Who among you has true fear and reverence of Yahweh? Who of you listens to the voice of his servant? Are any of you groping in the dark without light? Trust in the faithful name of Yahweh and rely on your God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But if you presume to light your own torch, you are playing with fire. So go ahead, walk in the light of your own fires and the sparks you have kindled. But I can promise you this: it will take you down into torment!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="51">
				<verse number="1">“Listen to me, you who chase after righteousness, you who passionately pursue the Lord. Look back to Abraham, the rock from which you were cut, to Sarah, the quarry from which you were dug, and remember what I did for them.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yes, look to Abraham your father and to Sarah, who bore you. For when I called Abraham, he was but one person, but I blessed him greatly so that one became many.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Indeed, Yahweh will comfort Zion, restore her, and comfort all her broken places. He will transform her wilderness into the garden of Bliss, her desert into the garden of Yahweh. Joy and laughter will fill the air with thanksgiving and joyous melodies.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Listen to me, my people; pay attention to me, my nation. For I release my teaching to the nations, and I will cause the light of justice to rest on them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">My righteousness is coming closer, and my salvation has gone out. My mighty arms will govern the people. The islands will trust in me and put their hope in the unveiling of my might.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Lift up your eyes to the heavenly realm and look at the earth far below. Though the heavens disappear like smoke, though the earth wears out like a garment, and though all the people die like gnats, my salvation will endure forever and my righteousness will never end!</verse>
				<verse number="7">So listen to me, you who care for what is right, who treasure my teaching in your hearts: Do not fear the insults of others; do not be troubled when they revile you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">They are nothing for you to fear, for the moth will eat them up like a shirt and the worm will consume them like wool, but my righteousness will last forever and my salvation from generation to generation.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Awake, God, awake! Arm of Yahweh, put on your robe of strength! Awake and do the works of power as in ancient days, as in generations past! Wasn’t it you who smashed the sea monster to pieces, who pierced the dragon in generations long ago?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Wasn’t it you who dried up the Red Sea with its deep waters and made a path through the sea to rescue your redeemed?</verse>
				<verse number="11">Do it again! Those Yahweh has set free will return to Zion and come celebrating with songs of joy! They will be crowned with never-ending joy! Gladness and joy will overwhelm them; despair and depression will disappear!</verse>
				<verse number="12">“I, yes I, am the one who comforts you. All the sons of men will be cut down and fade like grass. Why then would you be afraid of a mere human being?</verse>
				<verse number="13">You have forgotten that Yahweh, your Maker, stretched out the skies and laid earth’s firm foundation. But you live each day constantly worrying, living in fear of your angry oppressor who is bent on your destruction. But their fury cannot touch you!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Those who are suffering will soon be released. They will not die in their dark dungeon, nor will they go hungry.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For I am Yahweh, your faithful God, who split the sea with its roaring waves. My name is Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">“I have placed my words in your mouth and have hidden you in the hollow of my hand to establish the heavens and make the earth rock solid. You will say to Zion, ‘You are my people!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Wake up! Wake up! Get up, Jerusalem! You have drunk enough from the cup Yahweh handed you. It was the cup of his anger, and you’ve drained it dry— the intoxicating bowl that makes men stagger!</verse>
				<verse number="18">There are none of Zion’s children left, none to guide her home and take her by the hand, none among all the children she has raised.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Twin calamities have come upon you, but who will feel sorry for you? Disaster and devastation, famine and war, but who will comfort you?</verse>
				<verse number="20">Your children have fainted and lie fallen in the streets, like a gazelle caught in a net. Yahweh ’s anger, the rebuke of your God, has overwhelmed them.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So listen, you who are weak and wounded, who are intoxicated not with wine but with God’s anger.</verse>
				<verse number="22">This is what your sovereign ruler, Lord Yahweh, your God, the Mighty Defender of his people, says: “Look! I have removed from your hand the intoxicating cup that made you stagger. You will no longer drink from the bowl of my anger.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Instead, I will put that bowl in the hands of your tormentors who said to you, ‘Lie down so we can walk all over you!’ For your back became like the ground they trample on, like a street for them to walk on.”</verse>

				<verse number="2">Arise and shake off your dust! Sit enthroned, Jerusalem! Break off your shackles of bondage from your neck, you captive daughter of Zion!</verse>
				<verse number="3">For this is what Yahweh has to say: “You were sold for nothing; now you will be redeemed without any payment.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">For Yahweh says: “Long ago, my people went down to Egypt and lived as foreigners there, and for no good reason Assyria oppressed them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And now, what have I here?” says Yahweh. “Indeed, my people have been taken into bondage without cause while mocking rulers howl; and every day my name is continually despised!” says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Therefore, my people will know the power of my name, and they will know in that day that I am the one who promised them, saying, ‘Behold, I am here!’ ”</verse>

				<verse number="8">Listen! The watchmen are shouting in triumph! Lifting their voices together, they are singing for joy! For right before their eyes, they can see Yahweh returning to Zion!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Burst into joyous songs, you rubble of Jerusalem! For Yahweh has graciously comforted his people; he has become the Kinsman-Redeemer of Jerusalem!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yahweh has unveiled his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations. To the ends of the earth, everyone everywhere will see the salvation of our God!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Go! Go, and leave Babylon behind! Touch nothing unclean as you depart. Keep your life pure as you leave, you who carry the vessels of Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="12">You will neither have to leave in haste, nor will you make a frantic escape, for your God, Yahweh, will go before you. He will lead you each step and be your rear guard.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Look! My servant will prosper and succeed! He will be highly honored, raised up, and greatly exalted!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Just as many were appalled at the sight of him (for so marred was his appearance, like an object of horror; he no longer looked like a man),</verse>
				<verse number="15">so now he will startle many nations. Kings will be shocked speechless before him. For they will now see a sight unheard of, and things never considered before now fill their thoughts.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="53">
				<verse number="1">Who has truly believed our revelation? To whom will Yahweh reveal his mighty arm?</verse>
				<verse number="2">He sprouted up like a tender plant before the Lord, like a root in parched soil. He possessed no distinguishing beauty or outward splendor to catch our attention— nothing special in his appearance to make us desire him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He was despised and rejected by men, a man of deep sorrows who was no stranger to suffering and grief. We hid our faces from him in disgust and considered him a nobody, not worthy of respect.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yet he was the one who carried our sicknesses and endured the torment of our sufferings. We viewed him as one who was being punished for something he himself had done, as one who was struck down by God and brought low.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But it was because of our rebellious deeds that he was pierced and because of our sins that he was crushed. He endured the punishment that made us completely whole, and in his wounding we found our healing.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Like wayward sheep, we have all wandered astray. Each of us has turned from God’s paths and chosen our own way; even so, Yahweh laid the guilt of our every sin upon him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">He was oppressed and harshly mistreated; still he humbly submitted, refusing to defend himself. He was led like a gentle lamb to be slaughtered. Like a silent sheep before his shearers, he didn’t even open his mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="8">By coercion and with a perversion of justice he was taken away. And who could have imagined his future? He was cut down in the prime of life; for the rebellion of his own people, he was struck down in their place.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They gave him a grave among criminals, but he ended up instead in a rich man’s tomb, although he had done no violence nor spoken deceitfully.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Even though it pleased Yahweh to crush him with grief, he will be restored to favor. After his soul becomes a guilt-offering, he will gaze upon his many offspring and prolong his days. And through him, Yahweh ’s deepest desires will be fully accomplished.</verse>
				<verse number="11">After the great anguish of his soul, he will see light and be fully satisfied. By knowing him, the righteous one, my servant will make many to be righteous, because he, their sin-bearer, carried away their sins.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So I, Yahweh, will assign him a portion among a great multitude, and he will triumph and divide the spoils of victory with his mighty ones — all because he poured out his life-blood to death. He was counted among the worst of sinners, yet he carried sin’s burden for many and intercedes for those who are rebels.</verse>

				<verse number="1">“Rejoice with singing, you barren one! You who have never given birth, burst into a song of joy and shout, you who have never been in labor! For the deserted wife will have more children than the married one,” says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“ Increase is coming, so enlarge your tent and add extensions to your dwelling. Hold nothing back! Make the tent ropes longer and the pegs stronger.</verse>
				<verse number="3">You will increase and spread out in every direction. Your sons and daughters will conquer nations and revitalize desolate cities.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Do not fear, for your shame is no more. Do not be embarrassed, for you will not be disgraced. You will forget the inadequacy you felt in your youth and will no longer remember the shame of your widowhood.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For your Maker is your husband; his name is Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies! Your Kinsman-Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel! He has the title Mighty God of All the Earth!</verse>
				<verse number="6">For I, Yahweh, have invited you to come back like a depressed, deserted wife. Like a young wife who has experienced rejection, I am drawing you back to me,” says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“For just a brief moment I deserted you, but with tender feelings of love I will gather you back to me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">In a surge of anger, for just the briefest moment, I hid my face from you, but with everlasting kindness, I will show you my cherishing love,” says Yahweh, your Kinsman-Redeemer.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“To me, this is like the time when I vowed that the waters of Noah’s flood would never again cover the earth. Now I vow to you that I will neither be angry with you nor rebuke you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Even if the mountains were to crumble and the hills disappear, my heart of steadfast, faithful love will never leave you, and my covenant of peace with you will never be shaken,” says Yahweh, whose love and compassion will never give up on you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“You unhappy one, storm-tossed and troubled, I am ready to rebuild you with precious stones and your intimacy with me will be built on a foundation of sapphires.</verse>

				<verse number="13">All your children will be taught by Yahweh, and great will be their peace and prosperity.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You will be established in righteousness. Oppression—be far from you! Fear—be far from you! Yes, terror will not come near you, nor will you be afraid.</verse>
				<verse number="15">If anyone dares to stir up strife against you, it is not from me! Those who challenge you will go down in defeat.</verse>
				<verse number="16">See, I am the one who created the craftsman who fans the coals into a fire and forges a weapon fit for its purpose, and I am the one who created the destroyer to destroy.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But I promise you, no weapon meant to hurt you will succeed, and you will refute every accusing word spoken against you. This promise is the inheritance of Yahweh ’s servants, and their vindication is from me,” says Yahweh.</verse>

				<verse number="3">Pay attention and come closer to me, and hear, that your total being may flourish. I will enter into an everlasting covenant with you, and I will show you the same faithful love that I showed David.</verse>
				<verse number="4">See! I made him a witness to the nations, an example of leadership, as prince and commander of peoples.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Look! You will summon nations you’ve never heard of. Nations who have never heard of you will come running to follow you because Yahweh, your God, the Holy One of Israel, has glorified you!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Seek the Lord Yahweh when he makes himself approachable; call upon him when you sense he is near.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The wicked need to abandon their ways, and sinful ones need to banish every evil thought. Let them return to Yahweh, and they will experience his compassionate mercy. Yes, let them return to God, for he will lavish forgiveness upon them.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“For my thoughts about mercy are not like your thoughts, and my ways are different from yours.</verse>
				<verse number="9">As high as the heavens are above the earth, so my ways and my thoughts are higher than yours.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“As the snow and rain that fall from heaven do not return until they have accomplished their purpose, soaking the earth and causing it to sprout with new life, providing seed to sow and bread to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So also will be the word that I speak; it does not return to me unfulfilled. My word performs my purpose and fulfills the mission I sent it out to accomplish.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">For you will leave your exile with joy and be led home wrapped in peace. The mountains and hills in front of you will burst into singing and the trees of the field will applaud!</verse>

				<verse number="3">They say, ‘Why is it that when we fasted, you did not see it? We starved ourselves, and you didn’t seem to notice.’ “Because on the day you fasted you were seeking only your own desires, and you continue to exploit your workers.</verse>
				<verse number="4">During your fasts, you quarrel and fight with others and strike them with an angry fist. When you fast like that, your voice will not be heard on high.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Do you think I’m impressed with that kind of fast? Is it just a day to starve your bodies, make others think you’re humble, and lie down in sackcloth and ashes? Do you call that a fast? Do you think I, Yahweh, will be pleased with that?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">“This is the kind of fast that I desire: Remove the heavy chains of oppression! Stop exploiting your workers! Set free the crushed and mistreated! Break off every yoke of bondage!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Share your food with the hungry! Provide for the homeless and bring them into your home! Clothe the naked! Don’t turn your back on your own flesh and blood!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then my favor will bathe you in sunlight until you are like the dawn bursting through a dark night. And then suddenly your healing will manifest. You will see your righteousness march out before you, and the glory of Yahweh will protect you from all harm!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Yahweh will answer you when you pray. When you cry out for help, he will say, ‘I am here.’ “If you banish every form of oppression, the scornful accusations, and vicious slander,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and if you offer yourselves in compassion for the hungry and relieve those in misery, then your dawning light will rise in the darkness and your gloom will turn into noonday splendor!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh will always guide you where to go and what to do. He will fill you with refreshment even when you are in a dry, difficult place. He will continually restore strength to you, so you will flourish like a well-watered garden and like an ever-flowing, trustworthy spring of blessing.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Your people will rebuild long-deserted ruins, building anew on foundations laid long before you. You will be known as Repairers of the Cities and Restorers of Communities.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“If you stop pursuing your own desires on my holy day, and refrain from disregarding the Sabbath, if you call the Sabbath a delightful pleasure and Yahweh ’s holy day honorable, if you honor it properly by not chasing your own desires, serving your own interests, and speaking empty words,</verse>
				<verse number="14">then you will find the joyous bliss that comes from serving Yahweh. And I will cause you to prosper and be carried triumphantly over the high places of the land. You will enjoy the heritage of Jacob, your ancestor.” Certainly the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="59">
				<verse number="1">Truly Yahweh ’s arm is not too powerless to save you nor his ear too deaf to hear.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Rather, your sinful deeds have built a barrier between you and your God. Your sins have made God turn his face from you so that he does not hear your prayers.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For your hands are stained with blood and your fingers are dripping with the guilt of sin. Lies spill from your lips and your tongue mutters treachery.</verse>
				<verse number="4">No one seeks true justice; no one pleads his case with honesty. They rely on their illusions and misleading lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to sin.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They hatch harmful plots like snake’s eggs and spin their lies like a spider spins its web. Whoever eats their “eggs” dies and a poisonous snake gets hatched!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Their “webs” cannot substitute as clothing, they cannot cover themselves with the lies they spin, nor can their works cover them adequately. Their actions are evil, and the wages of violence is in their hands.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Their feet eagerly run after evil, and they are swift to shed innocent blood. Their imaginations are filled with evil; destruction and desolation litter their paths.</verse>
				<verse number="8">They know nothing of the way of peace, and injustice is their way of life. Their paths are so crooked that no one who walks in them knows peace.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For this reason, justice is far from us and righteousness doesn’t reach us. We hope for light, but sadly, there is only darkness. We wait for a bright light, but walk in darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="10">We are like the blind groping along a wall, inching along in the dark like those who cannot see; we stumble around in broad daylight like it was night, like the walking dead.</verse>
				<verse number="11">We are frustrated, growling like bears, like doves cooing mournfully. We wait and wait for justice, but it never seems to come; for salvation, but it remains distant.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For our many rebellious deeds are stacked high before you; our sins testify against us. We are aware of our sins, and we know our evil deeds all too well.</verse>
				<verse number="13">We have rebelled and even tried to deny Yahweh; we have forsaken our God. Our speech stirs up oppression and revolt, and our hearts conceive, then confess, lies.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Justice is driven away and righteousness stands on the sidelines, for truth has stumbled in the public square and morality cannot enter.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yes, truth has disappeared, and those who turn from evil become the next victims. Yahweh saw this and was greatly displeased that there was no justice.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And then he was astonished to see that there was no champion, not even one, who would rescue the oppressed. So then his own mighty power rescued him, and his own righteousness supported him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He put on righteousness as his body armor, salvation for a helmet; a garment of warring vengeance was his uniform and passion, his cape.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He will repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes, according to what they have done. Reckoning is coming to the islands for what is due them.</verse>
				<verse number="19">From the west to the lands of the rising sun, the glory and the name of Yahweh will be held in highest reverence, for he will break in as a flooding, rushing river driven on by the breath of Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="20">“He will come to Zion as a Kinsman-Redeemer to those of Jacob’s tribes who repent of their rebellion,” says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“And this is my covenant promise with them,” says Lord Yahweh. “From now on, my Holy Spirit will rest on them and not depart from them, and my prophetic words will fill their mouths and will not depart from them, nor from their children, nor from their descendants, from now on and forever,” says Lord Yahweh.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="60">
				<verse number="1">“Rise up in splendor and be radiant, for your light has dawned, and Yahweh ’s glory now streams from you!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Look carefully! Darkness blankets the earth, and thick clouds covers the nations, but Yahweh arises upon you and the brightness of his glory appears over you!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Nations will be attracted to your radiant light and kings to the sunrise-glory of your new day.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Lift up your eyes higher! Look all around you and believe, for your sons are returning from far away and your daughters are being tenderly carried home. Watch as they all gather together, eager to come back to you!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Then you will see with understanding and be radiant. Your heart will be thrilled and swell with joy. The fullness of the sea will flow to you and the wealth of the nations will be transferred to you!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Caravans of camels will cover your land, young camels loaded with goods from Midian and Ephah. All the wealthy merchants from Sheba will come, bearing gold and frankincense and singing the praises of Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="7">All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered to you, and the rams of Nebaioth will be yours as acceptable sacrifices on my altar, and I will adorn with more glory my glorious temple.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Who are these who soar like clouds, flying like doves into their portals?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Indeed, the distant islands eagerly look for me, with their large ships leading the way. They are bringing Zion’s children from afar. They come with offerings of silver and gold to honor the name of Yahweh, your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has glorified you!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Foreigners will rebuild your walls and their kings will serve you. Even though I punished you in my anger, I will restore you in my gracious favor and show you my tender compassion.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Your gateways will always remain wide open around the clock to let in the procession of kings bringing their constant stream of the riches of the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The nation or kingdom that refuses to serve you will perish and be utterly ruined.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Lebanon’s glory will be yours. The cypress, fir, and pine will come to you to beautify the site of my holy place. And I will glorify the place where I rest my feet.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The descendants of your oppressors will come bowing low before you, and all who hated you will bow down at your feet. They will call you The Beautiful City of Yahweh, Glorious Zion of the Holy One of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Although once you were rejected and despised, undesirable for anyone to pass through you, I will make you majestic forever, a source of joy for every generation.</verse>
				<verse number="16">You will guzzle the milk of nations and suckle at the breast of kings. You will know me intimately that I am Yahweh, your Savior, for I am the Mighty Hero who rules over Jacob’s tribes, your Kinsman-Redeemer!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“I will replace your copper with gold, your iron with silver, your wood with copper, and your stone with iron. I will install peace and prosperity as your government and righteousness as your overseer.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Threats of violence will no longer be heard in your land, nor will destruction and ruin be found within your borders. You will name your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">“The sun will no longer be needed to brighten the day, nor the moon to shine at night, for Yahweh will be your unfailing light; your God will be your glory!</verse>
				<verse number="20">There will be no more sunsets or new moons, for Yahweh will be your everlasting light and your days of sadness will be over.</verse>
				<verse number="21">All your people will be righteous and will permanently possess the land. I planted them there as a tender sapling, the work of my own hands to display my glory.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I will multiply the least of you into a thousand and the weakest one into a mighty nation. I am Yahweh, and when the right time comes, I will accomplish it swiftly!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="61">
				<verse number="1">The mighty Spirit of Lord Yahweh is wrapped around me because Yahweh has anointed me, as a messenger to preach good news to the poor. He sent me to heal the wounds of the brokenhearted, to tell captives, “You are free,” and to tell prisoners, “Be free from your darkness.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">I am sent to announce a new season of Yahweh ’s grace and a time of God’s recompense on his enemies, to comfort all who are in sorrow,</verse>
				<verse number="3">to strengthen those crushed by despair who mourn in Zion— to give them a beautiful bouquet in the place of ashes, the oil of bliss instead of tears, and the mantle of joyous praise instead of the spirit of heaviness. Because of this, they will be known as Mighty Oaks of Righteousness, planted by Yahweh as a living display of his glory.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They will restore ruins from long ago and rebuild what was long devastated. They will renew ruined cities and desolations of past generations.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Foreigners will be appointed to shepherd your many flocks; strangers will cultivate your fields and tend your vines.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But you will be known as Priests of Yahweh, and called Servants of our God. You will feast on the wealth of nations and revel in their riches!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Because you received a double dose of shame and dishonor, you will inherit a double portion of endless joy and everlasting bliss!</verse>
				<verse number="8">“For I, Yahweh, love fairness and justice, and I hate stealing and sin. I will rightly repay them because of my faithfulness and enter into an everlasting covenant with them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Their seed will be famous among the nations, and their descendants the center of attention of the people. All who see them will recognize that they are the seed that Yahweh has blessed with favor!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">I will sing and greatly rejoice in Yahweh! My whole being vibrates with shouts of joy in my God! For he has dressed me with salvation and wrapped me in the robe of his righteousness! I appear like a bridegroom on his wedding day, decked out with a beautiful sash, or like a radiant bride adorned with sparkling jewels.</verse>
				<verse number="11">In the same way the earth produces its crops and seeds spring up in a garden, so will the Lord Yahweh cause righteousness and praise to blossom before all the nations!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="62">
				<verse number="1">For Zion’s sake, how can I keep silent? For Jerusalem’s sake, how can I remain quiet? I will keep interceding until her righteousness breaks forth like the blazing light of dawn and her salvation like a burning torch!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Nations will see your victory-vindication, and every king will witness your blinding radiance! You will be called by a brand-new name, given to you from the mouth of Yahweh himself.</verse>
				<verse number="3">You will be a beautiful crown held high in the hand of Yahweh, a royal crown of splendor held in the open palm of your God!</verse>
				<verse number="4">You will never again be called the Abandoned One, nor will your land be called Deserted. But you will be called My Delight Is in You, and your land My Beloved Wife, for Yahweh finds his delight in you and he married your land.</verse>
				<verse number="5">As a young man marries the young woman he loves, so your builder-sons will marry you. As the bridegroom finds joy in his union with his bride, so will your God take joy in his union with you!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jerusalem, I have stationed intercessors on your walls who will never be silent, day or night. You “reminders” of Yahweh, take no rest,</verse>
				<verse number="7">and tirelessly give God no rest, until he firmly establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of all the earth!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh swears an oath by the authority of his right hand and by his mighty arm: “I will never again give your new grain as food for your enemies, nor will foreigners drink your new wine that you worked hard to produce.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Instead, you who harvest it will eat it and offer your praise to Yahweh, and you who gather the grapes will drink the new wine in my holy courts.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Pass through, pass through the gates, and go from old to new. Prepare a new path for the people. Build! Build up a highway for them to come to me! Remove every hindrance and unfurl a banner for the nations!</verse>
				<verse number="11">See? Yahweh has proclaimed to the ends of the earth: Tell my daughter, Zion, “Look, here comes your Deliverer! See? He’s bringing his reward, and his recompense goes before him.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">They will be called His Holy People, The Redeemed of Yahweh. And you will be known as Those Whom God Loves, A City Not Abandoned.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="63">
				<verse number="1">Who is this coming from the city of Bozrah in Edom? He is dressed in garments of bright scarlet, robed in a garment dyed bright red, marching like a champion in his great power and might. “It is I! I am the one who announces righteousness, I am mighty and ready to save!”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Why are your robes so red, like those of one treading grapes?</verse>
				<verse number="3">“I have been treading in the winepress alone, and there was no one there from the nations to help me. I stomped on the nations in my anger and trampled them down in my wrath. Their blood soaked my clothing and stained all my robes.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For a day of vengeance was in my heart, and the time for my redeeming work had come.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I looked, but there was no one to help me. I was amazed that there was no one to support me. So my own power accomplished salvation, and my wrath sustained me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So I trampled down nations in my anger and shattered them in my fury and spilled their blood on the ground.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will tell again of the faithful, gracious acts of Yahweh and praise him for everything he has done for us— the wonderful goodness, the riches of his mercy, which he has shown to the house of Israel, and the abundance of his endless love.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For he said, “Truly, they are my loyal children who will not act deceitfully.” He became their Savior.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When they suffered, he suffered with them. The Angel of His Presence saved them. Out of his enduring love and compassion he redeemed them. He lifted them up, carried them in his arms, and cared for them all the days of old.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But they rebelled against him and grieved his Holy Spirit. Only then did he turn against them. He became their enemy and fought against them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then they remembered God’s deeds in days past, the days of Moses and his people. And they asked: “Where now is Yahweh, who brought them miraculously through the Red Sea along with Moses, the shepherd- leader of his flock, and put his Holy Spirit among them?</verse>
				<verse number="12">Where now is the one who linked his magnificent power to Moses, who divided the waters before them to gain everlasting fame for himself?</verse>
				<verse number="13">Who led them through the depths of the sea? They were as sure-footed as horses on dry, level ground— they did not stumble.</verse>
				<verse number="14">As a herder leads his cattle to find rest in a fertile valley, the Spirit of Yahweh led them into rest. In the same way, you led your people to win for yourself a glorious name!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Lord, look down from heaven, from your holy, glorious dwelling place, and see us. What happened to your passion for us and your mighty acts of power? Why are you withholding from us your feelings of tender compassion?</verse>
				<verse number="16">For you are our loving Father. Even if our ancestors, Abraham and Jacob, don’t acknowledge us, you, O  Yahweh, are our loving Father! From ancient times your name is our Redeemer.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yahweh, why do you allow us to wander from your ways and harden our hearts to be so stubborn that we do not obey you? Please come back to us, for the sake of those who serve you, for the sake of your people, the tribes that are your inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For a short time your holy people possessed a holy place. But now our enemies have invaded and trampled down your sacred sanctuary.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You treat us as though we had never been your people, called by your name, or ruled by you.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="64">
				<verse number="1">God, if only you would tear open the heavenly realm and come down! How the mountains would tremble in your awesome presence!</verse>
				<verse number="2">In the same way that fire sets kindling to blaze and causes water to boil, let the fire of your presence come down. Reveal to your enemies your mighty name and cause the nations to tremble before you!</verse>
				<verse number="3">When you did amazing wonders we didn’t expect, you came down, and mountains shuddered in your presence!</verse>
				<verse number="4">These amazing things had never been heard of before; you did things never dreamed of! No one perceived your greatness. No eye has ever seen a God like you, who intervenes for those who wait and long for you!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Those who delight in doing what is right— you go out to meet them with kindness. They remember you and cherish your ways. You showed your anger when we sinned again and again, yet we can be saved.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We have all become contaminated with sin, and you see our self-righteousness as nothing better than a menstrual rag. We are all like fallen leaves, and our sins sweep us away like the wind.</verse>
				<verse number="7">No one calls on your name or presses in to lay hold of you, for you have hidden your face from us. You have let us be ruined by our own sins.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yet still, Yahweh, you are our Father. We are like clay and you are our Potter. Each one of us is the creative, artistic work of your hands.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh, don’t be angry with us! Don’t remember our sins again forever! Please look at us; we are your people.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Your sacred cities are abandoned like a desert; Zion is a wasteland; Jerusalem sits in ruins.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Our holy temple, our source of pride, where our ancestors sang your praise, has been consumed by fire. All that we held dear has been destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now, Yahweh, after all this, are you still unmoved? Will you continue to stand silently by and afflict us so severely?</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="65">
				<verse number="1">“I revealed myself to those who didn’t even ask to know me. Those who did not seek me found me. I said to a nation that did not call on my name, ‘Here I am! Here I am! I will help you! ’</verse>
				<verse number="2">Day after day I have graciously outstretched my hands to a people who turned their backs to me, whose way of life is corrupt, who insist on going their own way.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They are a people who continually insult me to my face. They openly and defiantly offer sacrifices to their gods in their sacred groves and burn incense on pagan altars.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They sit inside tombs and spend the night in secret caves. They eat pork and their pots are polluted with the broth of unclean meat.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They tell others, ‘Stay away! Don’t come near; I’m too holy for you to touch.’ These people are like a stench in my nostrils, a smoldering fire that doesn’t go out!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Their verdict is determined before me, and I will not keep silent: ‘I will repay them for what they have done; I will pay them back for what their sins deserve,</verse>
				<verse number="7">for both their sins and the sins of their fathers. Because they burned incense on the high places and blasphemed me on the hills, I will punish them severely, as their actions deserve,’ ” says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Here is what Yahweh says: “As new wine is found in the cluster, and someone says, ‘Don’t destroy it, for there is a blessing in it,’ that’s what I will do for my servants’ sake. I will not destroy them all.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I will raise up offspring from Jacob and from my chosen ones of Judah to possess my mountains, and my servants will settle there.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For my people who seek me, I will make the Plain of Sharon a pasture for flocks in the east, and in the west, the Valley of Trouble will be a resting place for cattle, for my people who seek me and no other god.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“But you who forsake Yahweh and ignore my holy mountain, who celebrate a feast for the goddess called Lady Luck and fill cups of wine to toast the god Destiny, know this: your luck has run out.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For I will destine you for the sword! You will all kneel down to be slaughtered like sheep because when I called, you did not answer, and when I spoke, you did not listen! You did evil before me and chose what I despise.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “My servants will eat, but you will go hungry. My servants will drink, but you will go thirsty. My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.</verse>
				<verse number="14">My servants will sing joyfully with hearts of gladness, but you will cry out from the pain deep inside, and wail from a broken heart.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When you die, your name will become a curse used by my chosen ones. The Lord God will put you to death, but his godly servants will leave behind the legacy of an honorable name.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For whoever pronounces a blessing on the earth will do so in the name of the God of Faithfulness. And whoever swears by an oath on the earth will invoke the name of the God of Faithfulness. The failures of the past will be forgotten; they will be hidden from my eyes.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Look! I am creating entirely new heavens and a new earth! They will be so wonderful that no one will even think about the old ones anymore!</verse>
				<verse number="18">As you wait for the reality of what I am creating, be filled with joy and unending gladness! Look! I am ready to create Jerusalem as a source of sheer joy, and her people, an absolute delight!</verse>
				<verse number="19">I will rejoice in this new Jerusalem and find great delight in my people. You will no longer hear the sound of weeping or cries of distress.</verse>
				<verse number="20">No baby will die in infancy there, and everyone will live out their full lifespan. For when centenarians die, they will be considered youngsters, and anyone who dies earlier will be considered of no account.</verse>
				<verse number="21">People will build their own houses to live in, and they will not be taken over by someone else. They will plant their own vineyards to enjoy, and they will not be confiscated by someone else. They will live long lives, like age-old trees, and my chosen ones will enjoy to the fullest the work of their hands throughout their lives.</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23">They will neither work in vain for someone else, nor will their children face disaster for they will be children and grandchildren who are blessed by Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Before they even call out to me, I will answer them; before they’ve finished telling me what they need, I’ll have already heard.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The wolf and the lamb will graze side by side, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, and the serpent’s food will be dust. There will be neither violence nor murder on my entire holy mountain of Zion,” says Yahweh.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="66">
				<verse number="1">This is what Yahweh says: “The heavens are my throne and the earth is my footstool. Where is the house you will build for me? Where is the place where I will rest?</verse>
				<verse number="2">My hand made these things so they all belong to me,” declares Yahweh. “But there is one my eyes are drawn to: the humble one, the tender one, the trembling one who lives in awe of all I say.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But the one who offers a bull with no humility is like one who kills a man. The one who offers a lamb without contrition is like one who breaks a dog’s neck. The one who brings grain offerings with no heart-purity is like one who offers pig’s blood! The one who offers incense with no sincerity is like one who kisses an idol! They have all chosen their own way, not mine, and they take delight in these disgusting things!</verse>
				<verse number="4">So I chose to punish them and to bring on them what they fear the most because I called out to them and they ignored me. I spoke and they did not listen but did what is evil in my sight and chose what I despise.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Hear the words of Yahweh, you who tremble at what he says: “Shame on your own people, who reject you and hate you, claiming they do it for my sake. For they mock you, saying, ‘May Yahweh be glorified; let us see you rejoice.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Listen! A sound of uproar is coming from the city a sound from the temple! It is the thunder of Yahweh as he completely punishes his enemies!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Zion gave birth suddenly, even before going into labor. She delivered a son without any painful contractions.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Who has ever seen or heard of such a wonder? Could a country be born in a day? Can a nation be birthed so suddenly? Yet no sooner does Zion go into labor than she gives birth to sons!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh, your God, says, “Do I allow you to conceive and not to give birth? Do I shut the womb when I’m the one who delivers?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her! All who love her, join in with her great joy, especially those who remember her grief!</verse>
				<verse number="11">You, her children, will drink the milk of her prosperity and nurse with delight from her glorious abundance!</verse>
				<verse number="12">For Yahweh says: “I will extend to her prosperity like a river and the wealth of gentiles like a flooding river. You will nurse from her breast, be cradled in her arms, and delightfully bounced on her knees.</verse>
				<verse number="13">As a mother tenderly comforts her child, so will I tenderly comfort you, and you will find comfort in Jerusalem.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">When you feast your eyes on this, your heart will leap for joy and be revived; your body will flourish and sprout like grass. The mighty power of Yahweh will be revealed, resting on his servants, but his fury will be shown to his enemies!</verse>
				<verse number="15">Look! Yahweh is coming as a raging fire and his chariots like a whirlwind to unleash his anger with fiery fury and with the fiery lightning of his rebuke!</verse>
				<verse number="16">For with fire and with his sword Yahweh will judge humanity— many will be the slain of Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="17">“The end is near for those who ‘consecrate’ and ‘purify’ themselves to enter their cultic groves! They go in procession one after another into their ceremonies. They eat disgusting foods —pork, mice, and rodents.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I despise their evil works and their thoughts,” says Yahweh. “The time is coming for me to gather people together from all over the world, and they will come and gaze on my radiance.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I will set an amazing sign among them. I will send some of the remnant to other nations—to Tarshish, Put, Lud (known for its archers), Tubal, Javan, and distant islands that have never heard of my fame nor gazed on my glory. They will declare my glory among the gentiles!</verse>
				<verse number="20">And they will bring back from the nations your own people as an offering to me,” says Yahweh. “They will come on horseback, in chariots, in wagons, on mules and camels to my holy mountain, Jerusalem,” says Yahweh. “In the same way my people bring a grain offering in a sacred vessel to the temple, they will be brought as grain offerings to my holy mountain, Jerusalem, as a holy offering to me.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And some of them I will appoint as Levitical priests,” says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="22">This is what Yahweh declares: “The new heavens and the new earth that I am making will remain and endure before me in the same way your offspring and your name will endure.</verse>
				<verse number="23">From one Sabbath to the next, one month to the next, one year to the next, all humanity will come to worship me!</verse>
				<verse number="24">“They will go out of the city and see the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me. For their worm will not die and their fire will never go out. And they will be abhorrent to humanity.”</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">The prophecies of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah. Jeremiah was one of the priests from the village of Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh began to reveal his message to him in the thirteenth year of King Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh continued to speak to him throughout the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the fifth month of the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah, another son of Josiah, king of Judah. That was when the people of Jerusalem went into captivity to Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yahweh spoke these words to me:</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Before I shaped you in the womb, I knew you intimately. I had divine plans for you before I gave you life, and I set you apart and chose you to be mine. You are my prophetic gift to the nations.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">I replied: “But Lord Yahweh, I don’t know how to speak in public. Besides, I’m too young.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">But Yahweh interrupted me: “Do not use your youth as an excuse, for you will go wherever I send you, and you will speak whatever I tell you to say.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Fear nothing when you confront the people, for I am with you, and I will protect you. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Yahweh reached out with his hand and touched my mouth and said to me: “Now I have put my words in your mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="10">See! Today I have imparted to you great authority over nations and governments, to uproot and demolish, to destroy and dismantle. And you will plant and build something new.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh spoke to me again: “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I replied: “I see an almond branch.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">“You have seen the vision correctly,” Yahweh said. “Now know this: I constantly watch over my word to fulfill it.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh spoke these words to me a second time: “Now what do you see?” I replied, “I see a large boiling pot, tipped toward us from the north.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Yahweh said: “ This means disaster will boil over from the north, and calamity will spill over everyone living in this land.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Listen! I, Yahweh, declare that I am about to summon all the armies of the northern kingdoms. Their kings will come and set up their thrones at the gates of Jerusalem. They will attack its walls and all the other cities of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I will pass sentence against the people of Jerusalem and Judah for all their wickedness in deserting me. They have sacrificed to other gods and worshiped the works of their hands.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Jeremiah, get yourself ready! Arise with fresh courage and say to them all that I command you to say. Do not break down before them, lest I break you before them.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Listen! Today, I am making you as strong as a fortified city, unbreakable as an iron pillar, and impenetrable as bronze walls. You will withstand the persecution of the whole land and the contempt of Judah’s kings, officers, priests, and all the people.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They will fight against you, but they will not win, for I promise I am always with you to rescue you. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke these words to me:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Go, preach this message publicly for all Jerusalem to hear: ‘ Yahweh says to you: “ ‘I fondly remember the single-hearted devotion you had for me in your youth. You loved me deeply as a bride loves a bridegroom. You followed me closely in the desert, in a land where no crops grow.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Israel, like the firstfruits of my harvest, I set you apart, and you belonged to me alone. Anyone who devoured you I made to suffer, and I rained disaster down upon them. I, Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jacob’s tribes, listen! Every clan of Israel, listen to the words of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He declares to you: “What did your ancestors find wrong with me that they would run so far away from me? They left me to follow worthless idols and themselves became worthless!</verse>
				<verse number="6">They never stopped to ask themselves, ‘Where is Yahweh, who rescued us from Egypt? Where is the Yahweh who led us through the wilderness, through a barren wasteland with its pits and problems? Where is the one who led us through a land of deserts and droughts, dangers and deep darkness — where no one lives nor even passes through?’</verse>
				<verse number="7">“I brought you to this land of abundance to enjoy its lush fruit and goodness, but you entered the land and defiled my land. You made hideous the very land I call my own.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The priests did not stop and ask, ‘Where is Yahweh?’ The scribal scholars did not intimately know me. The shepherds of the people rebelled against me. The false prophets prophesied by the spirit of Baal, and they worshiped idols that could not help them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Therefore I, Yahweh, will bring charges against you once more, and not only against you but against your descendants as well. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Go off to the Greek islands and investigate for yourselves. Take a close look at Kedar also and observe very carefully. Has there ever been anything as disgusting as this?</verse>
				<verse number="11">Has a nation ever traded in its gods (even though they are not really gods)? But my people have bartered away their glory in exchange for gods who do nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Be appalled, O heavens, and cringe with fear! Be shocked and utterly devastated at this betrayal! I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“My people are guilty of a double sin: they have abandoned me, the Spring of Living Water, and they have dug for themselves cisterns — cracked cisterns that hold no water.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Is Israel a slave? Was he born a slave? Why, then, has he been seized like prey?</verse>
				<verse number="15">His enemies have raged against him, roaring like fierce lions. They leveled his cities, left them without inhabitants, and devastated his land.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Moreover, Egyptian armies will march from Memphis and Tahpanhes. They will come and shave your head bald.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Israel, you have no one to blame but yourselves! You stubbornly turned away even though Yahweh, your God, was leading you the right way.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Why, then, would you now go down to Egypt to drink the waters of the Nile? Why would you go to Assyria to drink from the river Euphrates?</verse>
				<verse number="19">Your own wickedness punishes you. Your own unfaithfulness rebukes you. Look deep into your heart and you will learn how evil and bitter it is to forsake me, Yahweh your God, and have no awe of me. I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Long ago, you broke your bond with me and severed ties. You boldly said, ‘I will not serve you!’ Yet, on every high hill and under every green tree, you offered yourself to other gods. You were like a prostitute sprawled out awaiting sex.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I planted you like a special vine from the absolute best seed, but look at what you’ve become now! You’re like a twisted, rotten vine.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Even if you scrubbed yourself with the strongest soap, your guilty stains would remain before my face. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“How dare you say, ‘I have not defiled myself. I’ve not chased after false gods.’ Look how you behaved badly in the valley. Don’t you realize what you’ve done? You’re like a restless wild camel running loose</verse>
				<verse number="24">or like a wild female donkey accustomed to the wilderness. While in heat, she sniffs the wind, and in her lust, no one can restrain her. Any male that wants her will find her ready.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Israel, don’t chase after other gods until you wear out your sandals and your throats are parched with thirst. Yet, you still say, ‘It’s hopeless; I can’t stop chasing them. I desperately love these foreign gods.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="26">“Just as a thief is ashamed when caught in the act, so all Israel will be shamed— your kings and princes, your prophets and priests.</verse>
				<verse number="27">You have called an idol of wood your ‘father’ and an idol of stone your ‘mother.’ You have turned your back toward me instead of your face. But how different it is when you get into trouble! You cry out to me and ask me to come and save you.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Now where are all your homemade gods? They are nowhere to be found. Let them arise and save you in your time of trouble! Judah, you have as many gods as you have villages!</verse>
				<verse number="29">What right do you have to complain about me? You have all rebelled against me,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="30">“I’ve wasted my time punishing you because you did not respond to my correction. With the ferocity of a hungry lion, you murdered the prophets I sent to you.</verse>
				<verse number="31">“O people of this generation, see the word of Yahweh: Have I been like a wilderness to Israel or a dangerous land full of gloom? Then why do my people say, ‘We’re free to do as we want, and we have no intention of returning to serve you anymore.’</verse>
				<verse number="32">Does a young woman disregard her engagement ring, or does a bride forget about her wedding dress? Yet, my people have continually forgotten me.</verse>
				<verse number="33">How skillfully you pursue your lovers; even the worst adulterers could learn from you.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Your clothes are stained with the lifeblood of the helpless and innocent, though you did not catch them breaking into your home. Despite all your guilt,</verse>
				<verse number="35">you dare to say, ‘I’m innocent! Yahweh is not angry with me anymore.’ But watch out! I, Yahweh, will judge you for perjury because you say: ‘I have not sinned.’</verse>
				<verse number="36">Look how you cheapen yourself by constantly shifting your course. Egypt will put you to shame just as Assyria did.</verse>
				<verse number="37">You will turn away from Egypt utterly humiliated, for I, Yahweh, have completely rejected those you trust. No alliance will be able to help you!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Here’s what Yahweh says: “If a man divorces his wife and she marries another, would he return to her again? Doing that would thoroughly defile the land. And you, Israel, have prostituted yourself with many lovers, yet now you want to come back to me? I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Look up to the barren heights and carefully consider: Is there any place where you have not offered yourself as a prostitute? You have sat by the roadside waiting for lovers, sitting like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Therefore, I have withheld the rains, and the spring showers have not come. Yet, there you sit with the shameless, brazen look of a prostitute who refuses to blush.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And yet you have the nerve to say to me, ‘Father! You’ve been my trusted companion as long as I’ve lived.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Surely, you won’t hold a grudge against me forever, right? You won’t always be angry with me, will you?’ This is only what you say, but you keep on doing all the evil you can get away with!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">During Josiah’s reign as king of Judah, Yahweh asked me, “Did you see what unfaithful Israel has done? Like an adulterous wife, she has turned away from me. In every high place and under every green tree, she has prostituted herself to worship other gods.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I thought that after all she had done, she would return to me, but she did not return. Meanwhile her treacherous sister, Judah, looked on.</verse>
				<verse number="8">She saw me give unfaithful Israel her divorce papers and send her away because of her continued adultery. Her treacherous sister, Judah, likewise had no fear; she, too, acted like a prostitute.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Her infidelity mattered little to her. She polluted the land and committed adultery by worshiping idolatrous stone and wood pillars.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Even after all this, Israel’s treacherous sister, Judah, refused to return to me with her whole heart; instead, she came with only deceitful lies,” declared Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And Yahweh continued, “Even unfaithful Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Go and carry this message to those living in the north: “ ‘ Yahweh is speaking to you, unfaithful Israel: Return to me. For my faithful love for you never ends. No frown of mine awaits you, declares Yahweh. I will not remain angry with you forever, for I am merciful, declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Only admit your guilt! You have rebelled against Yahweh your God. You have lavished your love on foreign gods under every green tree. You have not listened to my voice. I, Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“ ‘I say to you, Come back to me, my wayward children, and I will restore you. I will take you, one from each city and two from each clan, and bring you home to Zion because I alone am your true husband.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“ ‘I will give you true shepherds who follow my heart, and they will feed you with revelation-knowledge and deep understanding.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yahweh says, “When my children have increased and prospered in the land, then no one will mention the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. It will never even come to mind. No one will remember it, miss it, or make another one.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When that day comes, they will call Jerusalem the throne of Yahweh. All nations will be drawn there to be in the presence of Yahweh. They will no longer stubbornly follow their own evil hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="18">In those days, the nation of Judah will unite with the nation of Israel. And together, they will return from the northern lands to the land that I gave your ancestors as your own inheritance.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">“I, Yahweh, said: “ ‘What bliss would fill my heart to treat you like an honored son! What joy would fill my heart to give you a land of delights, the most glorious and beautiful inheritance among the nations.’ I longed for the day when you would call me ‘Father’ and not turn away from me.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Instead, as a treacherous wife betrays her husband, so, you, nation of Israel, have betrayed me. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">I hear the sound of voices echoing from the barren hills, the bitter weeping of the sons of Israel pleading for mercy because they lost their moral way and have forgotten Yahweh their God.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Come back to me, you unfaithful ones! Let me heal your waywardness and restore your faithfulness.” “ We’re here! We’re coming back to you, Yahweh, because you are our God.</verse>
				<verse number="23">We see it now. Our idolatrous worship on the high places and our noisy commotion on the mountains were nothing but delusions. Only you, Yahweh our God, can save us.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Ever since we were young, Baal, the god of shame, has robbed us of the abundance our ancestors labored for— their flocks and herds, their precious sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="25">We deserve to lie down in our shame and be covered by our disgrace. Ever since we were young, we and our ancestors have sinned against our God, Yahweh. We failed to really listen to your voice, Yahweh our God.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">“I, Yahweh, say to Israel: “Listen, if you turn to come back to me, then return to me with all your heart. If you remove your disgusting idols from before my face, then come home and never stray from my presence again.</verse>
				<verse number="2">If you make a promise in my name, saying, ‘As surely as Yahweh lives’ with truth, honesty, and integrity, then all other nations will desire his blessing and prosperity. They will shine and make their boast in me.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh says to the people of Judah and Jerusalem: “As a plow breaks open untilled ground, break open your hard hearts. Do not sow good seed among thorns.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Listen, people of Judah and Jerusalem. Circumcise your hearts and become vulnerable to me. If you do not, my anger will blaze up like unquenchable fire on account of your evil deeds.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yahweh says: “Blow the trumpet in Jerusalem, and sound the alarm throughout the land of Judah! Cry out! Shout it out, and say, ‘Gather together and let us run into the fortified cities!’</verse>
				<verse number="6">Set up a signal to run to Zion. Don’t just stand there; run for cover! I am bringing disaster from the north, terrible destruction is on the way.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">A nation-wrecker is on the prowl like a lion coming up from his lair. He is roused from his den to ransack your land. Your cities will be ruined and left without inhabitant.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Therefore, put on sackcloth, lament, and wail, for the burning anger of Yahweh has not turned away from us.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh has declared, “In that day, the courage of the king will melt away. The hearts of his officials will tremble. The priests will be overcome with fear, and the prophets horrified.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">In response to all this I said: “O Lord Yahweh, you have completely deceived Jerusalem and these people! You promised peace, yet even now, the blade of the sword threatens our lives.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">At that time it will be said to the people and to Jerusalem: “A blazing wind from the barren desert heights will blow upon my dear people, not a gentle wind to winnow or sift out—</verse>
				<verse number="12">I am sending a wind much stronger than that. Now, I will bring charges against them.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Look, as a storm cloud in the sky, he arises, and his war chariots kick up dust like a whirlwind. His horses are swifter than eagles. We’re done for! It’s over for us!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart so that you may be rescued. How long will evil thoughts and harmful schemes find a resting place in you?</verse>
				<verse number="15">I hear a shout warning of disaster from the territory of Dan and another from the hills of Ephraim.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Warn the nations of what is coming! Announce to Jerusalem: ‘Watchers are coming from a distant land, shouting a battle cry against Judah’s cities!</verse>
				<verse number="17">The enemies surround Judah and Jerusalem like men who are guarding a field, for Judah has rebelled against me,’ ” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“You have brought this on yourself by your deeds and your lifestyle. Your evil and your bitterness have reached your heart. This is your doom!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">With gut-wrenching pain deep in my soul, I writhe on the ground in anguish. My heart is pounding within me. I cannot keep silent, for I hear the shofar blast. I say to my soul, I hear the cry of war!</verse>
				<verse number="20">A chain of disasters, one after another. The entire land is in ruins! Suddenly, and in an instant, our tent and its curtains are destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="21">How long must I see their battle flags and hear their shofars blaring for battle?</verse>
				<verse number="22">“My people are foolish because they don’t know who I really am. They are reckless, senseless children. They think they are wise, but they are cunning in sinfulness and clueless in righteousness.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">I looked at the earth, and it was completely empty and formless, the heavens hid its light.</verse>
				<verse number="24">I looked at the mountains and saw them trembling, and all the hills were shaking to and fro.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I looked for a human, but not one was to be found. Every bird had flown away.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I looked at the once fruitful land, now nothing but a desert, all its cities left in ruins before Yahweh ’s burning anger.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“For I, Yahweh, have spoken: ‘The whole land will remain desolate; however, the end of the world is not yet.</verse>
				<verse number="28">This is why the earth will mourn, and the heavens will veil their light— because I have spoken. I will neither relent nor turn away from my plans.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="29">When they hear the approach of the horsemen and archers, the whole city flees in terror. Some run into the forest to hide, and others climb up into the rocks. Every city is deserted, and no one lives there anymore.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And you, desolate Zion, what are you doing dressing up in scarlet, adorning yourself in ornaments of gold and putting on eye shadow? You’re making yourself beautiful for nothing. Your lovers don’t want you anymore. In fact, they seek your life!</verse>
				<verse number="31">I heard a cry of a woman gasping in labor pains; I saw her writhing in distress as one giving birth to her first child. It is the daughter of Zion, gasping and stretching out her hands for help, saying: “I’m staring at death! I’m fainting before my murderers!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">“Roam the streets of Jerusalem; search her streets and public squares, and note what you see. See if you can find even one person who pursues justice. If you find even one acting with integrity, I will surely spare Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Though they take an oath, saying, ‘As surely as Yahweh lives,’ Yet they are taking my name in vain.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh, your eyes search for truth. You struck them down, but they felt no pain. You nearly destroyed them, but they still refused to accept correction. Their stubborn faces hardened like rock; they defiantly refused to repent.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I thought, “These poor people are senseless, for they know neither God’s ways nor the justice of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Let me go to the people in power, and let me speak to them. Surely, they must know what Yahweh demands and what God requires of them.” Yet they, too, have renounced obedience to God and have torn themselves away from him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Therefore, a lion from the forest will attack them, and a desert wolf will ravage them. A leopard is prowling around their cities, waiting to tear those apart who venture out. For the people are rebellious; they’ve sinned repeatedly.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“On what basis can I forgive you? Your children have forsaken me and sworn by gods that are not real. Even though I satisfied my people to the full, they committed adultery, beating a path to a whorehouse.</verse>
				<verse number="8">They’re like well-fed stallions lusting for mares; each man ‘neighs’ with lust after his neighbor’s wife.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Because of these things, will I not hold my people accountable? Am I not justified to punish a nation such as this? I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Here is what I, Yahweh, have decreed: ‘I will send your enemies to cut the branches from your vines, but they won’t destroy them completely. I will tell them to strip away your branches. The people of Judah and Israel have been utterly unfaithful to me and are no longer mine.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11"></verse>
				<verse number="12">They have lied about Yahweh, saying, “No disaster is coming. We won’t experience sword or famine. He won’t let anything happen to us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The prophets are full of hot air, and they do not have the word of Yahweh in them. May their threats backfire upon themselves!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Therefore, because the people have spoken these lies, Yahweh, the God of Angel Armies, said to me: “See! The words I put in your mouth will be as a fire. My words will consume these people like kindling.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I, Yahweh, say to the people of Israel: ‘I am stirring up a distant nation, an ancient, warring nation to attack you. Her people will speak a language you do not know, a language you won’t understand.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The quivers of her mighty warriors are like a welcoming tomb, inviting death and destruction, for all her warriors are proven in battle.</verse>
				<verse number="17">They will devour your harvest and your food. They will devour your sons and your daughters. They will devour your flocks and your herds, and devour your vines and your fig trees. You put your trust in your fortified cities, but they will ransack them and slaughter the inhabitants.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Yet even then,” Yahweh said to me, “I will not completely eliminate you.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And when people ask you, ‘Why did Yahweh our God bring this tragedy upon us?’ You will answer, ‘As you have forsaken Yahweh and served foreign gods in your land, so you will serve strangers in a foreign land.’</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Declare this to the descendants of Jacob and spread it throughout Judah:</verse>
				<verse number="21">‘Pay attention, you foolish and senseless people. They have eyes but refuse to see. They have ears but refuse to hear.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I, Yahweh, am speaking to you. Do you not fear? Do you not tremble in awe in my presence? I made the sand as a border for the sea, an ancient barrier that it does not pass. Though the waves roar and beat against it, they can neither go beyond it nor break through it.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But these people have stubborn, rebellious hearts. They all turn aside and go their own way.</verse>
				<verse number="24">They never say in their heart, “Let us now give reverence to Yahweh our God who gives us showers at the time of his favor, the early and latter rain in its season, and graciously gives us a harvest each year.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">The guilt of your sins has upset nature’s order and withheld my blessings from you. Your sins have kept these good things from you!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="26">“Lurking among my people are wicked criminals. They are like hunters hiding to catch birds in their nets, setting their traps to catch people.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Like cages full of captured birds, they fill their houses with lies and deceit. This is how they have become rich and powerful,</verse>
				<verse number="28">fat and prosperous. Indeed, their wickedness knows no bounds. There is no true justice in their judgments— they neither stand up for the rights of the orphans, nor help the needy receive their fair portion.</verse>
				<verse number="29">I, Yahweh, promise to hold them accountable for these things. I will be justified to punish a nation such as this.</verse>
				<verse number="30">“A shocking and horrible thing has happened in the land.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The prophets prophesy lies, and the priests lead out of their own self-interest. And my people love it that way. But what will they do when judgment comes?”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">“People of Benjamin, flee for your lives! Leave Jerusalem! Blow the shofar to warn the city of Tekoa! Send up a smoke signal at Beth Hakkerem! For disaster looms out of the north, a great destruction threatens you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Daughter Zion, you are so lovely and delicate, but I will destroy you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">As shepherds pasture many flocks all around a city, so the camps of enemy soldiers encircle you, like many flocks of grazing sheep.</verse>
				<verse number="4">In the morning, the soldiers will say, ‘Come on, prepare for war! We attack Jerusalem at noon!’ But later, as the sun grows hot, they will complain, ‘Woe to us, for the day is fading, and the shadows of evening grow long.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Arise, let us go up and attack tonight, then we will easily destroy her strongholds.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Here is what Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says: “Cut down the trees and set up a siege ramp against Jerusalem. This is a city ripe for punishment because she is riddled with brutal oppression.</verse>
				<verse number="7">As a spring pours out its fresh water, so she pours out her fresh evil. All I see are the sick and wounded; the violence and destruction within her cry out.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Learn your lesson, Jerusalem, lest I turn my back on you in disgust and make the whole land desolate, a land where no one lives!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh, the Commander of Angel Armies, says: “As one gleans the grapes that remain in a vineyard, those who remain of Israel will be gleaned. As the hand of the grape gatherer goes through the vines one last time, the Babylonians will glean what the Assyrians leave behind.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">If I speak to warn the remnant of Israel, no one will listen. Their ears are blocked, and they are incapable of hearing. The word of Yahweh has become an object of scorn; it’s no longer a pleasure for them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The fury of Yahweh has filled me, and I am weary of trying to hold it in. “Pour it out on every child playing in the street, on the young men gathered there. Women and men alike will be taken captive, both the middle aged and those advanced in years.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Strangers will seize their homes, their fields, and their wives. For I will stretch out my hand against the inhabitants of the land. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“From the smallest to the greatest, they are greedy for corrupt profits; prophet and priest alike, they all practice deceit.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They treat the wounds of my people as though they were scratches. They say, ‘Peace, everything is well,’ when there is no peace, and nothing is well.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Although they have acted shamefully and committed abhorrent acts, they feel no shame; they don’t even know how to blush. They will fall among the fallen and stumble in their time of reckoning, I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yahweh said to his people: “Stand at the crossroads. Now, consider your ways and ask for the ancient paths. Which is God’s way? Walk on his path, and you’ll enjoy a resting place for yourselves. But they said, ‘We will not. That’s not the path we want. ’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yahweh said, “I raised up prophetic watchmen to warn you: ‘Pay attention to the sound of the shofar!’ Still, they replied, ‘We will not.’</verse>
				<verse number="18">Hear well then, O nations, and observe as witnesses what’s in store for them.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Hear, O earth! I am bringing a catastrophe to these people, the fruit of their own evil schemes. For they refused to listen to my words, and threw all my instructions and warnings to the wind.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">“What use to me is all this frankincense that you’ve imported from Sheba and all these exotic spices from distant lands? I will not accept your burnt offerings; the aroma of your sacrifices is no longer sweet to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">So this is what Yahweh has said: “I will put obstacles before these people, and they will stumble and fall over them. Fathers and children, neighbors and friends, all will die.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">This is what Yahweh has said: “Look! They’re coming! Warriors approach from the north. From the remote parts of the earth, a great nation is preparing for war.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Armed with bows and spears, they are merciless and cruel. The sound of their armies riding their horses is like the roaring sea. The cavalry is formed for battle and ready to attack you, O Fair Zion!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">The people say: “We have heard the news, and our strength fails. Like a woman in childbirth, we are in agony, seized with pain.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Don’t go out into the field; stay off the streets! For our enemies are armed, and there is terror on every side.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">My dear people, it’s time to mourn. Put on sackcloth and sprinkle ashes on yourselves. Mourn as you would for an only child. Wail bitterly, for suddenly the destroyer will be upon us.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Yahweh said to me: “I have made you as one who tests metals among my people. In the same way a person tests metal, you will perceive and test their ways.</verse>
				<verse number="28">They are the most stubborn of rebels. Each one spreads slander and practices dishonesty. They are as hard as bronze and iron.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Though the bellows blow fiercely, yet the smelter smelts to no avail. Fire melts and burns away the lead, but my refining fire fails to separate the dross of their wickedness.</verse>
				<verse number="30">They are called ‘rejected silver,’ for Yahweh has rejected them.”</verse>

			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">This is the message that Yahweh gave to Jeremiah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Go stand at the gate of Yahweh ’s house and proclaim this word: ‘Hear this word from Yahweh, all you people of Judah who come through these gates to worship him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Here’s what the God of Israel, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says: Change your ways and start living right, and I will let you dwell in this land.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Don’t fool yourselves by trusting the deceptive words, saying: “The temple of Yahweh is here, the temple of Yahweh is here, the temple of Yahweh is here, so we are safe.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">For if you truly change your ways and start living right, if you deal justly with one another,</verse>
				<verse number="6">if you don’t mistreat the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow, if you don’t shed innocent blood in this land, if you stop your self-destructive ways of chasing after other gods,</verse>
				<verse number="7">then I will let you dwell in this place, here in the land that I gave to your forefathers for all time.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“ ‘Look, you keep putting your trust in worthless lies.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You think you can steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury, burn incense to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and then come and stand in my presence? You think you can come into this house called by my name and say, “We are safe!”—only to keep doing all these disgusting things?</verse>
				<verse number="11">Do you really consider this house that bears my name to be a robbers’ den? I know everything that you have been doing! I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“ ‘Just go to the place where my sanctuary once stood in Shiloh, where I first made a dwelling place for my name. And when you see its rubble, understand what I did in response to the wickedness of the people of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Even while you were doing these things, I, Yahweh, spoke to you over and over and called to you, but you would neither listen nor answer me.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So I will do to this temple what I did before in Shiloh. You have put your trust in this temple, which bears my name, but I will destroy this very sanctuary that I gave to you and your ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And I will cast you away from my presence as I cast away all your brothers, all the descendants of Ephraim.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="16">“ Jeremiah, do not pray for these people, do not lift up a cry or a prayer for them, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Don’t you see what they’re doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</verse>
				<verse number="18">The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the wives knead dough to make ritual cakes for the goddess Ishtar, known as the Queen of Heaven. They also pour out drink offerings to other gods to defy me.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yet, I am not the one they are hurting, says Yahweh; they are hurting themselves to their own shame.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Therefore, listen to the words of the Lord Yahweh: ‘My anger and my wrath will be poured out in this place, on the people and the animals, on the trees and on the crops; my anger will burn as a fire that no one can put out.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">“This is what Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies says: ‘You might as well eat all your burnt offerings yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For when I led your ancestors out of Egypt, I did not command them to bring me burnt offerings and sacrifices.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Rather, I commanded them: “Listen to my voice, and I will be your God, and you will be my people. Live your lives according to what I command you that all may go well with you.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">But they did not listen or obey. They followed their own stubborn plans of their evil hearts. They disrespected me and went backward, not forward.</verse>
				<verse number="25">From the day that I led your ancestors out of Egypt until now, I have persistently sent you my servants the prophets,</verse>
				<verse number="26">but my people did not listen to me or obey; rather, they stubbornly did more evil than their fathers.’</verse>
				<verse number="27">“And when you tell them all this, they will not hear you. You will call to them, but they won’t respond to you.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then you will say to them: ‘You are the nation that refused to listen to the voice of your God, Yahweh. Truth has perished and disappeared from their lips, for they did not accept Yahweh ’s correction.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="29">“ People of Jerusalem, cut off your long hair and throw it away, and raise your song of mourning on the hilltops, for Yahweh has rejected and abandoned the generation of his fury.</verse>
				<verse number="30">For Yahweh says: ‘The people of Judah have done what is evil before my eyes. They have defiled the house that bears my name by placing their detestable idols inside it.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And in the Hinnom Valley, they have built shrines of Topheth to sacrifice their sons and daughters in the fire—something I never commanded, nor did it ever enter my thoughts.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Therefore, the time is coming, says Yahweh, when it will not be known as Topheth or the Hinnom Valley but the Valley of Slaughter, for people will bury their dead in Topheth until no room is left.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Their corpses will be food for the birds and wild animals with no one to frighten them away.</verse>
				<verse number="34">I will silence the sounds of mirth and gladness from the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, the happy sounds of wedding feasts —the voice of the bride and bridegroom, for the land will become a wasteland.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Here is what Yahweh says: “At that time, they will desecrate the graves of Jerusalem and bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its princes, the bones of the priests, the bones of the false prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of the city.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They will spread them out before the sun and the moon and all the stars of heaven, which they loved and served. They went after cosmic powers, inquired of them, bowed down before them in adoration, and worshiped them. Because they did these things, their bones will not be buried but will become fertilizer for the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="3">However, I will leave some of these evil people alive and banish them to other places. Yet all the survivors will prefer death over life. For I, Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">“ Jeremiah, say to the people, ‘ Yahweh says: “ ‘Don’t people get back up when they fall down? Don’t they turn around when they take the wrong road?</verse>
				<verse number="5">So why have you, the people of Jerusalem, continually refused to turn back to me? Why do you cling so tightly to your deception instead of coming home to me?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">I have listened carefully to what they say, but nothing they say is right. No one is sorry about his sin, saying, “What have I done wrong?” Everyone keeps on going his own way, like a war-horse plunging headlong into battle.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Even the stork in the skies knows her season of migration. And migratory birds —the turtledove, the swallow, and the crane — instinctively take flight according to the times I have set for them, but my people pay no attention to the orders of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="8">How dare you say, ‘We are wise, because we have the law of Yahweh?’ Look! The scribes teach lies about the law. They have made the law itself into a lie!</verse>
				<verse number="9">The know-it-alls will be shamed, terrorized, and trapped. They walked away from the word of Yahweh, so wisdom walked away from them.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Therefore I will give their wives to other men and their fields to those who will take over the land. From the smallest to the greatest, they are all greedy for corrupt profits; priest and prophet alike, they all practice deceit.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And they treat the wounds of my beloved people as though they were scratches. ‘Don’t worry,’ they say. ‘Peace, everything is well,’ when there is no peace, and nothing is well.</verse>
				<verse number="12">They have acted shamefully, and have committed abhorrent acts, yet they feel no shame. They don’t know how to blush. Surely, they will fall among the fallen, and stumble when I deal with them,” says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh says: “I will surely make an end of them. There will be neither cluster on the vine nor figs on the fig trees— even the leaves have withered. I gave them a good harvest, but it escaped from them.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Why are we just sitting here? Let’s band together and go inside our walled cities and await our death, since Yahweh our God has condemned us to die. He has given us our bitter poison to drink, for we have sinned against him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">We had hoped for peace and prosperity, but no blessing came. We had hoped for a time of healing, but we were overtaken by sudden terror!</verse>
				<verse number="16">The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan. At the sound of the cries of his stallions, the whole land quakes. They have entered to completely devastate the land, Jerusalem, and its inhabitants.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“For look! I am sending slithering snakes to bite you— venomous vipers that cannot be charmed,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="18">My joy has vanished, grief grips my soul, and I am sick at heart.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Listen! I hear my beloved people crying out in despair throughout the land: “Is Yahweh no longer in Zion? Is her King not dwelling within her?” “So why have they provoked me to anger with their carved images and with their foreign, phony gods?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Summer has ended, the harvest is past, and still we are not saved!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">I am broken over the brokenness of my dear people. I mourn all day long. Horror has gripped me.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Is there no healer in Gilead? Is there no medicine there? Why then have the people I love not been healed?</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">How I wish my head were a reservoir that could weep a fountain of tears. I would weep day and night for my beloved ones who have been slain!</verse>
				<verse number="2">If only I had a shelter in the wilderness, a place for weary travelers to spend the night. Then I could leave my people and go away from them because they’re all unfaithful to God — a company of corrupters.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh says: “They shoot out lies with their tongues, just as an archer uses a bow to shoot arrows. Their lies have prevailed in the land, but they are not faithful to Yahweh. My people go from one evil thing to another because they do not know my heart.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Beware of your neighbor and do not even trust your brother, for every brother is a cheater, and every friend is a slanderer.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They all are professional liars who lie to their neighbors. They are completely dishonest, and have trained their tongues to lie. They weary themselves doing wrong.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jeremiah, you live surrounded by oppression, deceit heaped upon deceit, and the people refuse to intimately know me,” says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Therefore, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says: “Listen! I will refine my dear people by fire and test them because of what they have done. I have no other choice.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Their words are deadly arrows poisoned with deceit. Each one greets his neighbor with ‘Shalom,’ but deep in his heart, he secretly sets a trap for him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I, Yahweh, will hold them accountable for these things. And I will take vengeance to punish a nation such as this.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">I will weep and wail for the mountains and sing mournful songs for the pasturelands, for they are burned, with no one passing through. No one hears the lowing of cattle; birds and beasts of the field have fled—they are gone.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“I, Yahweh, will turn Jerusalem into rubble, a den of jackals. And I will turn the cities of Judah into ghost towns where no one lives.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Why is the land burned and destroyed, left like an uninhabited wilderness? Who is wise enough to understand this? Who is the prophet with a word from Yahweh to explain it?</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh himself supplies the answer: “Because they have rejected my laws, which I gave them, they refused to live as I told them, and they have not listened to my voice.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Instead, they stubbornly followed their hearts’ desires and chased after the Baals, just like their ancestors taught them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Therefore I, Yahweh, the God of Israel and Commander of Angel Armies, say to you: “Look! I will feed them bitter wormwood, and give them poisonous water to drink.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I will also scatter them among the nations. They will live as exiles among people they and their fathers have never known. I will send the sword after them until I have made an end of them.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says: “Look around you and discern. Summon the wailing women. Call for those most skilled at mourning.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Let them hurry and wail over us that our eyes may overflow with tears and our eyelids gush with water.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For the voice of wailing is heard from Zion: ‘We are so ruined and shamed! We have had to leave our land because enemies have demolished our homes.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Women, listen to the word of Yahweh and take to heart the word he speaks. Teach your daughters to mourn; teach your neighbor a funeral song.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For Death has crept in through our windows, forcing its way past our fortified defenses, cutting down the child playing outside and the young men in the streets.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Tell everyone: “This is the prophecy of Yahweh: ‘Corpses will lie unburied like dung on the open field, like stalks of grain after the reaper, with no one to gather them up.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Yahweh says: “The wise must not boast in their wisdom, the mighty must not boast in their power, and the wealthy must not boast in their riches.</verse>
				<verse number="24">If you’re going to boast, then boast about this: that you understand my ways and know my heart, and you know that I am Yahweh. Let the wise boast in knowing how I demonstrate infinite love, true justice, and righteousness, for these are the things that delight my heart,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Look,” Yahweh says, “the day is coming when I will punish all who are circumcised in the flesh only:</verse>
				<verse number="26">the Egyptians, the people of Judah, the Edomites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, and the tribes in the desert who shave their heads bald. The men in all those lands are uncircumcised. And the Israelites are just like them because their hearts are uncircumcised.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Israel! Hear the word Yahweh speaks to you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh says: “Do not adopt the ways of other nations or be terrified by unusual signs in the heavens even though the unbelieving nations are in awe of them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For the religious practices of the nations are delusions. They cut down a tree from the forest, then a craftsman fashions it with his hands.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He adorns his idol with silver and gold and takes hammer and nails to secure it so it won’t wobble.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Their idols are like speechless scarecrows standing in a field; someone must carry them around because they can’t even take a step. So don’t fear them in any way, for they are incapable of doing good or evil.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Yahweh, there is no God like you; you are unrivaled in your greatness and might! The power of your name is so great!</verse>
				<verse number="7">King of the nations, who would not fear you? Yes, it is proper to reverence you. Among all the wise ones of the nations and among all their royal ones, there is still no one as magnificent as you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">What wisdom could they glean from a block of wood? They are foolish blockheads, one and all.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They cover their idols with beaten, refined silver and gold, even fine gold. The hammer of a craftsman and the hands of a goldsmith craft their image, robing them in garments of violet and purple. They are nothing but the work of human hands.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Only Yahweh is the true and living God, the King of all ages! At his fury the earth trembles, and nations crumble before his wrath.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Say to them: “ ‘The gods who did not create the heavens and the earth will be destroyed from the earth and from under the heavens.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yahweh made the earth by his glorious power and firmly established it by his great wisdom. By his skill he stretched out the sky.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When he speaks, the heavenly ocean roars! He makes the clouds rise from the distant horizon. He launches his lightning in the midst of the rain and unleashes his stormy winds from heaven’s storehouses. Out of his treasuries of rain, lightning bolts, and stormy winds, he launches them forth.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Everyone is ignorant, knowing nothing. Every craftsman is shamed by the idols they make since their idols are nothing but lifeless lies.</verse>
				<verse number="15">What they make is worthless—nothing but a joke! When Yahweh comes to punish them, they will perish.</verse>
				<verse number="16">You idols are nothing like Yahweh, the true Treasure of Jacob. For he created the universe and has chosen Israel to be his inheritance. Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, is his name.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jerusalem, you besieged city, pack up your belongings and get ready to leave the land.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For Yahweh says: “Look! I am throwing you off the land, and I will bring you distress until you are captured.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Woe is me —my brokenness! My wound is incurable. I once said: “Oh, I must bear this suffering,” and I assumed I could endure it.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But my tent has been torn down, and all my cords are severed. I’ll never see my children again, for they have left me. There is no one left to stretch out my tent and no one who can hang my curtains.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For the leaders of the nation are foolish, and they refuse Yahweh ’s guidance. Therefore, without insight, they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Look, there is news to report! There’s a roar and a rumble coming from the north, coming to make the cities of Judah a rubble and turn it into a den of jackals.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now, I know, O  Yahweh, that our destinies are not our own to choose, and it is not in our power to direct our own steps.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Correct us, Yahweh, according to what is right, but go easy on us — don’t correct us in your anger, or there would be nothing left of us.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Vent your anger and pour it out on all these nations around us. They’re the ones who do not worship you. See how they’ve attacked the people of Jacob, consuming the land and leaving it desolate.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke these words to Jeremiah:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Hear the terms of this covenant and repeat them to the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Preach to them, ‘ Yahweh, the God of Israel, says to you: A curse will rest on whoever disobeys the terms of this covenant</verse>
				<verse number="4">that I made with your ancestors when I freed them from the fiery, iron furnace of their suffering in Egypt. Now, listen to my voice and do all that I commanded you, and you will be a beloved people to me, and I, I will be your God,</verse>
				<verse number="5">so that I may keep the promise that I gave to your fathers to give them a beautiful land flowing with milk and honey, the land which is yours today.’ ” And I answered him, and said, “ Yes, Yahweh, amen.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then Yahweh said to me: “Preach this message in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: ‘Hear the words of this covenant and do them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For I warned your fathers repeatedly, when I freed them from the land of Egypt until now, to listen to my voice.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But they refused to listen or change their ways. They lived in the stubbornness of their evil hearts, so I finally enforced the penalties of disobeying this covenant and its terms which I commanded them to keep.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="9">And Yahweh said to me: “The people of Judah and Jerusalem conspire against me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They have turned back to commit again the same sins of their ancestors, who ignored my words. They, too, have chased after foreign gods to serve them. The people of Israel and the people of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Therefore, I, Yahweh, say: Behold! I am bringing calamity upon them from which they will not be able to escape. And they will cry to me, but I will pay no attention.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense, but those false gods certainly will not be able to save them when calamity comes.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The people of Judah worship as many gods as they have cities. They have as many altars to burn incense to that shameful one, Baal, as they have streets in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“ Jeremiah, do not pray for these people nor cry out nor intercede on their behalf, for when trouble strikes and they cry out to me, I will pay no attention.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“My dearly beloved ones have done so much evil that they no longer have a right to come into my temple. Can the flesh of their many sacrifices avert their doom? When I send calamity, they will have nothing to be joyful about.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I, Yahweh, once called you a green olive tree, full of leaves and bearing beautiful fruit. But with the sound of a great roar, I will set fire and consume its branches.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, planted you and have decreed disaster against you because of the evil of the people of Israel and the people of Judah. You have provoked me to anger by burning incense to Baal.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">I knew about the evil some people were doing; it was Yahweh who revealed it to me.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I was like a trusting lamb led to the slaughter. I had no idea they were speaking about me when they said, “Let’s destroy the tree while it’s in full bloom. We’ll kill him so that no one will remember him anymore.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then I prayed, “ Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, you always judge fairly, and you test the most secret thoughts and desires of the heart. I have placed my cause before you, so let me live long enough to see you take revenge on them.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yahweh responded with a word for the men of Anathoth who wanted to take my life and who said to me, “You must no longer prophesy in the name of Yahweh, or we will certainly kill you.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">So Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, said, “Listen, I will punish them. The young men will die in battle, their sons and their daughters will die by food shortages,</verse>
				<verse number="23">and none will survive. For I will bring disaster upon the men of Anathoth when I come to punish them.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh, whenever I complain to you, you always prove to be right. Nevertheless, hear my plea that I bring to you. Why is it that wicked people are successful? Why do scoundrels live so secure and serene?</verse>
				<verse number="2">You plant them like trees that take root; they spread their branches and bear fruit. They talk like they know you, but their affections are so far from you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But as for me, Yahweh, you know me fully. You see me, and you understand me. You have tested my feelings for you and found that I am fully devoted to you. Set them aside like sheep that are going to be killed; keep them ready for the time of their slaughter.</verse>
				<verse number="4">How much longer will the land mourn? How much longer must the birds and animals perish? Even the grass of every field withers because of the wickedness of these people! For the people boast, “God doesn’t see what happens to us.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">“So, the footmen have beaten you, have they? How, then, will you run with the cavalry? If you stumble in the open country, how will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?</verse>
				<verse number="6">For even your brothers and relatives have betrayed you, and are in full pursuit of you. Don’t believe them when they speak to you as friends.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">“I have abandoned my house of Israel and deserted the people I call my own. I have surrendered the beloved of my soul over to her enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="8">My own inheritance has turned against me like savage, roaring lions in the jungle; therefore, I will deal with her as though I hate her.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Are hyenas and birds of prey all trying to devour the people I chose for myself? Are birds of prey circling around her? Go, gather all the wild beasts and bring them to devour her.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Many rulers have destroyed my vineyard. They have trampled my property and have made my magnificent fields into a desolate desert.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They have left it a wasteland— wasted, waterless, and empty before me. The whole land is laid waste, yet there is no one who seems to care.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Many destroyers have marched over those barren hills. Yahweh ’s sword has devoured the people throughout the land; no one is safe.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The people planted wheat but reaped nothing but weeds. They wearied themselves for nothing. They will be disappointed by their small harvest because of the burning anger of Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Here is what Yahweh said to me concerning our evil neighboring nations who attacked the land he promised to my people Israel: “I will uproot those nations and throw them off their land. I will also uproot the people of Judah and rescue them from the midst of their enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then after a period of exile, I will again show compassion to each nation and bring each one back to their homelands.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They once taught my people to worship Baal, but if they acknowledge me as the only true God, and if they learn from my people how to worship me, then I will establish them and prosper them alongside my people.</verse>
				<verse number="17">However, if they don’t listen to me, I will uproot them from their lands and completely destroy them. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Here is the command Yahweh spoke to me: “Go and buy a linen loincloth and put it around your waist, but don’t wash it.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">So I obeyed Yahweh ’s command, and I bought the loincloth and wore it under my tunic.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then, Yahweh spoke to me a second time:</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Now, take the loincloth you bought and are wearing and go at once to Perath and cover it up there in a crevice of the rock.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So, I obeyed Yahweh and went and buried it at Perath.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then, after a long time, Yahweh spoke to me again, saying, “Go at once to Perath and dig up the loincloth that I commanded you to bury there.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So I went to Perath and dug up the loincloth from where I had buried it, and I found it ruined. It was worthless.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then Yahweh spoke these words to me:</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Even so, like a soiled undergarment, I will ruin all the arrogant pride of Judah and Jerusalem, says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="10">These evil ones refuse to hear my words, they stubbornly follow the inclinations of their own hearts, and they follow other gods to serve and worship them. So then, they will all become like this worthless, rotten undergarment.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For as the loincloth clings snugly to the loins of a man, so I brought close to me all the people of Israel and Judah, says Yahweh. I wanted them to cling to me as my people and bring honor to me and proclaim my glory. But they would not obey.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Speak this word to them: ‘Here is what Yahweh, the God of Israel says: Every wine jar should be filled with wine.’ And if they say to you, ‘Of course, everyone knows that wine jars should be filled with wine. Do you think we don’t know that?’</verse>
				<verse number="13">then answer them, ‘ Yahweh says: I am going to fill all the people of this land with a drunken stupor, including the kings of David’s descendants, the unfaithful priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And I will smash them one against the other, parents and children alike, says Yahweh. I will show no pity or compassion, and my mercy will not stop me from destroying them.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Hear this and listen well. Forsake your pride, for Yahweh has spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Give all glory to Yahweh your God before he brings darkness, and you stumble and fall on mountain paths in the dusk of twilight. Give him glory before he turns the light you’re longing for into a death shadow and deep gloom.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If you will not listen, I will weep bitterly in secret from the depths of my soul because of your stubborn pride. My eyes gush with copious tears running down my face, because the flock of Yahweh is taken captive.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Say to King Jehoiachin and his mother, “Come down from your high thrones and take a humble seat, for your glorious crown has tumbled off your heads.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">The cities in southern Judah are under siege, and no one can free them. All the people of Judah will be carried into exile, carried completely away.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Lift up your eyes and see the Babylonians coming from the north. What will become of the cities of Judah? Like a beautiful flock of lambs, they were entrusted to your care.</verse>
				<verse number="21">What will you say when those you courted as allies are appointed as your masters? You will be gripped with pain as a woman giving birth.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And when you ask yourself, “Why are these things happening to me?”— it is because your sin was so enormous that your skirts are lifted up and your private parts exposed.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Can the Ethiopian change the color of his skin, or the leopard remove his spots? Of course not. And neither can you change from being schooled to do evil to doing good.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“This is why I will scatter you like dust driven by the desert wind.</verse>
				<verse number="25">You have it coming, and I have precisely measured your punishment,” declares Yahweh, “because you have trusted in lies and forgotten me entirely.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I, in turn, will lift your skirts over your face, and everyone will see your nakedness.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Woe to you, Jerusalem! I have seen your adulteries, your lustful neighing, your shameless prostitution, your vile acts on the hills and in the fields. How long will you continue being unclean?”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">This is what Yahweh spoke to me concerning the drought:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Judah is weeping, and her doors are dark with discouragement. Her people sink to the ground in mourning; their cries of lament rise from Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The elite send their servants for water, but when they come to the cisterns, they are bone dry. So, they return with their vessels empty. Humiliated, they cover their faces with shame.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Since there has been no rain, the ground is dry and cracked at harvest season, and the farmers hang their heads in humiliation.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Because there is no grass, even the doe in the field forsakes her newborn fawn.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights, Panting for air like jackals; their eyes are glazed over because there is no pasture.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Our guilty sins cry out against us; in our rebellion, time and time again, we have sinned against you. Yahweh, do something to help us, for the sake of your honor.</verse>
				<verse number="8">O Hope of Israel, Our only deliverer in time of trouble, why do you act like some stranger in the land, like an uninterested traveler who stops only for the night?</verse>
				<verse number="9">You are a mighty warrior! Why are you acting like a man overcome with weakness, like someone who can’t save us? Yet here you are, dwelling among us, Yahweh. You’ve attached your name to us. Don’t leave us now!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Yahweh spoke to me concerning these people: “They love to go astray, and they find such pleasure in their wandering. Therefore, I no longer find pleasure in them. Now I will remember all the evil they have done and punish their sins.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">And Yahweh said to me, “Don’t intercede on behalf of these people!</verse>
				<verse number="12">They can fast and pray all they want, but I still won’t listen to their cry. Neither will I accept their burnt offerings and meal offerings that they present to me. I will destroy them by war, food shortages, and plague.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">I said, “But Lord Yahweh! The prophets are prophesying: ‘You won’t experience war; neither will food shortages come upon you. God will protect you securely in this place.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Yahweh replied: “The prophets are using my name to lie to the people. I’ve not sent them or commissioned them. I’ve not spoken a word to them. They prophesy false promises and speak of an imaginary future—things they have made up in their minds.</verse>
				<verse number="15">This is what I, Yahweh, am going to do to those lying prophets. They claim to speak in my name although I did not send them, and they say that there will be no war or food shortages in this land. Therefore, it is by war and food shortages that I will kill them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And those who foolishly believed these prophecies will meet the same end. They will all die from war and food shortages, along with their wives and sons and daughters. Their bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, with no one to bury them. For I will bring evil to them as they have been evil.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“So, Jeremiah, speak your message of sorrow over them: “ ‘My eyes gush with tears day and night. I can’t stop weeping over all that my people have suffered. For my beloved people have suffered a great wound and are left grievously injured. They are as precious to me as a young daughter.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If I go into the countryside— there they lie, slain by the sword. If I enter the city— there they lie, sick and starving. Both prophet and priest wander throughout the land, with no revelation to share.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Lord, have you completely rejected Judah? Does your soul really despise Zion? Why have you crushed us so that we can’t be healed? We longed for peace and happiness, but nothing good ever came. We longed for a time of healing, and we find a time of terror instead.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yahweh, we acknowledge our wickedness before you— we have sinned against you, just like our fathers did.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For the sake of your great name, do not disown us; do not dishonor Jerusalem, that glorious place from which you rule. Don’t break your promise; remember your covenant with us.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Can any of the false gods of foreign nations give us rain? Can the skies by themselves give showers? Only you can, O  Yahweh, our God! So, we place all our hope in you, for only you accomplish all these things.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Then Yahweh said to me: “Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me to intercede for these people, I would not turn my heart back to them. Send them away from me and make them go.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And if they ask you, ‘Where are we to go?’ answer them, ‘Here is what Yahweh says: “ ‘Those destined to die by the plague, go die by the plague. Those destined to die by the sword, go die by the sword. Those destined to die by food shortages, go die by famine. Those destined for captivity, go into captivity.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="3">For Yahweh says, “I will send them four destroyers—the sword to slay, the dogs to drag away, the wild animals to devour, and the birds of prey to consume them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I will make them a horrible sight that will shock the entire world because of the wicked things King Manasseh son of Hezekiah of Judah did in Jerusalem.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yahweh says, “Who will feel sorry for you, people of Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you? Who will even bother to ask about your welfare?</verse>
				<verse number="6">I, Yahweh, say to you: You left me, turned your back on me, and walked out. So, I have stretched out my hand to punish you. I am weary of feeling sorry for you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I threw you to the wind like straw, scattering you throughout the cities of the earth. I made my people childless and killed them, since they would not repent from their ways.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Their widows became more numerous than the sands of the seas. In broad daylight, I have brought against them an unexpected destroyer to kill young men and mothers alike. Suddenly, I brought upon them terror and panic.</verse>
				<verse number="9">She who was honored to have seven children grows faint; robbed of her children, she wasted away. Her sun has set while it is still day. She is shamed and disgraced. Any who are left alive, I will hand them over to the sword of their enemies,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="10">My mother, how terrible that you ever bore me— a man doomed to conflict and strife with everyone against me! I have never cheated anyone, yet everyone curses me.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh answered me: “I will surely deliver you for a good reason. Have I not stood beside you in times of difficulty and in times of distress against the enemy?</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Will a man break the hardest iron or bronze?</verse>
				<verse number="13">I will turn over your wealth and your treasures as spoil for your enemies. This is the price you will pay because of all the sins you’ve committed throughout the land.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And I will make you serve your enemies in a foreign land, for my anger has caught fire, and I am furious against you.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then I said, “ Yahweh, you understand everything perfectly. Remember me and act on my behalf. Pay back all those who persecute me. Do not be so patient with my enemies; take revenge on them before they kill me. It is for your sake that I suffer insult after insult.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When you speak to me, I devour every word. Your word brings me such boundless joy. The endless delight of my heart is in knowing that your beautiful name is attached to me, O  Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I haven’t joined the crowd at their merry celebrations just to have a good time. I’ve kept to myself because your strong hand upon my life sets me apart. And your anger over what they have done fills me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Why must my pain be endless? Why are my wounds incurable? Why won’t they heal? You’ve been to me like a deceitful spring that stops flowing, like a brook that goes dry.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Here is what Yahweh said to me: “If you give up your hopeless tone of despair and return to me, I will restore you as my spokesman, and you will stand before me and enjoy my favor. If you separate the precious from the worthless, you will be my mouthpiece. They will turn to you, but you are not to turn to them.</verse>
				<verse number="20">They will fight and attack you, but I will make you as strong and secure as a fortified wall of bronze. They will not conquer you, for I already have! I am with you to deliver and rescue you,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“I will save you from the power of the wicked and rescue you from the clutches of ruthless men.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me again and said:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“You are not to marry or have children in this land.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For this is what I, Yahweh, have to say concerning any children that may be born in this place and concerning their mothers and fathers in this land:</verse>
				<verse number="4">They will die of deadly diseases. No one will mourn for them or bury them; their bodies will lie like dung on the ground. They will be consumed by the sword and by food shortages, and the birds and beasts will feast on their corpses.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">For Yahweh says: “You are not to enter a house of mourning or go there to lament and to console them. For I have lifted my favor off that people,” declares Yahweh. “I will no longer show them my kindness and compassion.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The least and the greatest alike will die in this land. They will not be buried. No one will mourn for them, cut themselves, or shave their heads to show their grief.</verse>
				<verse number="7">No one is to offer food to people in mourning, to comfort them in their loss. Even if it is their fathers or mothers who have died, do not give them a cup of consolation.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Nor are you to go into a house where people are feasting, to enjoy their festivities.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For here is what Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, the God of Israel, says: I will silence in this land the joyful shout of bride and bridegroom, the sounds of gladness and laughter. It will happen in your lifetime, before your very eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“And when you prophesy all these words to that people, and they ask you, ‘Why has Yahweh decreed all this great evil against us? What is the wrong and the sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God?’</verse>
				<verse number="11">Answer them, ‘Because your ancestors walked away from me, declares Yahweh, and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They abandoned me and failed to keep my instruction.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yet you have acted even worse than your ancestors. Each of you follow the stubborn desires of your evil hearts and refuse to listen to me.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Therefore, I will fling you out of this land to a land that neither you nor your fathers have known. And there you will serve other gods, day and night to your heart’s content, for I will have no pity for you.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Listen, a time is coming,” declares Yahweh, “when it will no more be said, ‘As surely as Yahweh lives, who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt,’</verse>
				<verse number="15">but rather, ‘As surely as Yahweh lives, who brought the Israelites back from the land of the north and from all the lands to which he had banished them.’ For I will restore them to their homeland, which I gave to their ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Behold, I will summon many fishermen,” declares Yahweh, “and they will fish them out. After that, I will summon many hunters, and they will hunt them out of every mountain and hill and chase them out of their hiding places in the rocks.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For I see everything they do. They are not hidden from my presence, nor does their guilt escape my gaze.</verse>
				<verse number="18">First, I will pay them back in full— even double for their evil and their sins. They have defiled my land and made it unfit for me because of their dead, detestable idols and have filled the land I have chosen for my own with their abominations.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yahweh, you are my strength and my stronghold, my sanctuary in a time of trouble. Nations will stream toward you from the ends of the earth and say: “The gods of our ancestors are nothing but frauds, worthless idols that could do nothing for them.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Can anyone make his own gods? If so, how could they be real gods?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yahweh says, “Surely, I will teach these people. Once and for all, I will cause them to experience my powerful hand and my might, and they will learn that my name is Yahweh!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh says: “ People of Judah, your sins are engraved indelibly on the stone tablets of your hearts and on the horns of your altars, engraved with an iron pen and a chisel with a diamond point.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Your people have set up pagan altars to the goddess Asherah everywhere in your land—under large trees, on hills</verse>
				<verse number="3">and mountains, and in open fields. So, as punishment for all your sins, I will take your treasures—everything you own, including your altars —and give them all to your enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You will forfeit, by your own deeds, the wonderful inheritance I have given you to possess. I will make you serve your enemies in a foreign land you have never known, for you have kindled the flame of my anger, which will burn forever.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yahweh said to me: “Even a strong person is cursed when his confidence rests in his own strength. To place your confidence in the strength of man means that you are turning your heart away from me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">That person is like a desert tumbleweed in a dry and dusty desert, in a rocky wilderness without inhabitant. Even when goodness is all around him, he won’t experience it.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“I will bless with happiness the one who trusts in me, the one who trusts in me alone.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He is like a tree planted on the riverbank, extending its roots into streams of water. It does not fear when scorching heat comes, for its leaves remain fresh and never fading even in a year of drought. It has no anxieties but continues to bear luscious fruit.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">There is nothing more deceitful than the heart of man; who can understand it? Man’s heart is sick, in need of healing.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“I, Yahweh, probe the heart, and I thoroughly test the inner being to give to all people what they deserve according to their ways and based on their deeds.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Go ahead and cheat others dishonestly, but by mid-life, everything you’ve gained will fly away, like birds hatched from stolen eggs. You will be proven a fool in the end.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Our sacred sanctuary is a throne radiating the glory of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh, you are the only hope of Israel! All who forsake you will be covered with shame. Those who turn away from you will be written in the dirt. To forsake you, Yahweh, is to forsake the fountain of living waters.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yahweh, you alone are my praise. Heal me, and I will be perfectly healed; save me, and I will be completely saved.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Listen to what the people keep saying to me: “Where is the word of Yahweh? Let it come to pass!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But I have not stopped running after you and being a true shepherd. Nor have I secretly longed for the day of disaster. You know every word my lips have spoken, for they were spoken in your presence.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Do not cause me disappointment. You are my safe place in a day of calamity.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Let those who persecute me be ashamed, and don’t let me be disgraced; let them be the ones who are disheartened and not me. Bring on them the day of disaster, and shatter them with double destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yahweh said to me: “Go and stand in the public gate of Jerusalem by which the kings of Judah enter and leave, and then go to all the gates of Jerusalem</verse>
				<verse number="20">and preach to the people: ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, you kings and people of Judah, and all who live in Jerusalem who enter by these gates!</verse>
				<verse number="21">“ ‘ Yahweh declares: If you value your lives, stop carrying any loads on the Sabbath day, bringing them through the gates of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Nor shall you carry any loads out of your houses on the Sabbath day or do any work; rather, you must set apart that day to honor me as I commanded your ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="23">(Yet they would not listen or obey; they stubbornly refused and would not obey or accept instruction.)</verse>
				<verse number="24">If you listen to me, declares Yahweh, and do not bring in any load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day but observe the Sabbath day as set apart for me and do no work that day,</verse>
				<verse number="25">then kings of David’s lineage will pass through the city’s gates. The kings and their officials will be riding in chariots or riding horses and will be accompanied by the people of Judah and the people of Jerusalem. There will always be people living here.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then people will come from the towns of Judah and from the villages around Jerusalem and from the land of Benjamin, from the lowlands west of Jerusalem, from the hill country, and from the southern desert of Judah, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and frankincense, and offerings of thanksgiving to Yahweh ’s house.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But if you do not listen to me, if you treat the Sabbath as any other day on which you carry loads through the gates of Jerusalem, then I will set its gates on fire, and that fire will consume even the palaces of Jerusalem, and no one will be able to extinguish it!’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">Here is the word Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Arise and go to the potter’s workshop, and I will speak to you there.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So I went to the potter’s workshop, and there was the potter spinning his wheel.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And whenever a piece of pottery turned out flawed, he reworked it into another vessel, as seemed good to the potter.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Yahweh began to speak to me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Can I not do with the people of Israel just as the potter has done with the clay?” declares Yahweh. “Listen, people of Israel. You are clay that I shape in my hands like the clay in the potter’s hands.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If I speak of uprooting, breaking down, or destroying a nation or a kingdom,</verse>
				<verse number="8">and that nation turns back from its wicked ways, then I will turn back from the disaster that I planned against it.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And at another time, if I speak of planting or building a nation or a kingdom,</verse>
				<verse number="10">but that nation does evil in my eyes and does not listen to my voice, then I will relent concerning the good that I planned to show it.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“So now, go say to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, ‘ Yahweh says: Listen, I am a potter shaping punishment for you and working on a plan against you. Turn back, each person, from the evil way you live and the evil things you do!’</verse>
				<verse number="12">“But they will answer: ‘It’s too late! We’ll live as we choose and be just as stubborn and evil as we want to be.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Therefore Yahweh says: “Ask the people of every nation and find out if they have ever heard of such a horrible sin as what you, virgin Israel, have done to betray me.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Does the snow on Lebanon’s mountains ever melt away? Do the cold mountain streams ever run dry?</verse>
				<verse number="15">But my people have forgotten me and burn incense to gods who are nothing, who make my people stumble in their ways. They no longer follow the ways of blessing they knew before but have followed paths that lead them nowhere.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Their homeland is a wasteland, and everyone who passes by is horrified and trembles with fear.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Like a strong wind from the east, I will blow them away before their enemies. Since they have turned their back on me, I will turn my back on them and refuse to help them in their day of trouble.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then the people said: “Come on, let’s plan a scheme against Jeremiah! There are always priests and wise ones who can give us instruction. We will still have prophets to give us Yahweh ’s message. Come on, let’s attack his reputation and drum up phony charges against him. And let’s pay no attention to anything he says.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So I prayed, “ Yahweh, hear my cry! Can’t you hear the voice of my adversaries?</verse>
				<verse number="20">Good should not be repaid with evil, but look! They are digging a pit for me. Remember how I made intercession for them, pleading in your presence to turn away your wrath from them?</verse>
				<verse number="21">Therefore, may their children experience food shortages, and let them be killed by the sword. May death and warfare take away the men and youths, leaving the women as childless widows.</verse>
				<verse number="22">May cries be heard from their homes as you suddenly bring raiders upon them without warning. For they’ve dug a pit to catch me and hidden snares for my feet.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Yet, you know, Yahweh, all their plots to kill me. Do not pardon their sin or blot out their guilt! Let them stumble before you. Deal with them severely in the time of your anger.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh said to me, “Go to the pottery shop and buy a clay jar. Then take along some of the city officials and leading priests</verse>
				<verse number="2">and go to the Hinnom Valley, just outside the Potsherd Gate. Speak to the people the words I give you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Say to them, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, you kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, the God of Israel, says to you: I am going to bring such a great disaster upon this place that the ears of all who hear about it will tingle with astonishment.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For they, their ancestors, and the kings of Judah have defiled this place and forsaken me. They have sacrificed here to strange gods, whom they never knew, and have filled this place with the blood of innocent people.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They have built altars to Baal and sacrificed their children to the fire as burnt offerings to Baal. This is not something I commanded them to do, nor did it ever enter my mind.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Because they have done all this, behold, the time is coming when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the Hinnom Valley, but people will call it Slaughter Valley, declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“ ‘And I will also frustrate the plans of Judah and Jerusalem in this place. I will cause their bloodthirsty enemies to triumph over them, and I will give their dead bodies as food to the beasts of the field and birds of the sky.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I will make this once revered city an object of horror and astonishment; everyone who passes by it will be appalled and will make insulting remarks because of all its wounds!</verse>
				<verse number="9">I will cause their bloodthirsty enemies to lay siege to their city and cause them great suffering. They will become so desperate that they will become cannibals, eating their neighbors and even their own children.’</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Then, smash the clay jar in the sight of the men who go with you</verse>
				<verse number="11">and say to them: ‘ Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says to you: See this smashed clay jar? That is what I will do to you. I will smash these people and this city as one smashes a potter’s vessel, never to be repaired. You will bury your dead here in Topheth, this unclean place; so many of you will die that there won’t be enough room to bury them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">That is what I will do to this city and its inhabitants, declares Yahweh. I will make this sanctuary city into a cemetery like Topheth.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Both the houses of the kings of Judah and the houses of Jerusalem will be defiled like the place of Topheth—all the houses upon whose roofs offerings have been made to the whole host of heaven and drink offerings have been poured out to false gods.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="14">When Jeremiah returned from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy, he stood in the court of Yahweh ’s temple and said to all the people:</verse>
				<verse number="15">“ Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, the God of Israel, says to you: ‘I am going to bring upon this city and all its nearby villages every disaster that I have decreed against them because they have stubbornly hardened their hearts and refused to listen to my words.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">Pashhur son of Immer was a priest and the temple overseer. When he heard what Jeremiah had prophesied, he became angry.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So he arrested Jeremiah, beat him, and put him in stocks at the upper Benjamin Gate of Yahweh ’s temple.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The next morning, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “Pashhur, Yahweh has given you a new name—Terror Everywhere!</verse>
				<verse number="4">For Yahweh says to you: ‘I am making you a terror to yourself and to all your friends, who will be killed in battle while you look on. I will give all Judah into the hands of the king of Babylon. He will take them captive to Babylon or kill them with the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I will give all the wealth of this city—her resources, her prized possessions, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah—into the hands of their enemies, who will seize all the plunder and carry it off to Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You, Pashhur, and all your household will go into captivity as prisoners to Babylon. You will die there and be buried there, you and all your gullible friends to whom you have prophesied falsely.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yahweh, you pushed me into being a prophet, and I let you do it. You overpowered me, and now I am overcome. I have become nothing but a joke all day long, with everyone mocking me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Whenever I prophesy, you have me speak, “Violence and destruction!” I am ridiculed every time I proclaim your word. I get nothing but trouble and insults all day long.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When I tell myself, “I’m not going to speak his message ever again or prophesy any more in his name,” then all at once you are within me like a burning, consuming fire deep in my bones. I try my best to hold your word inside, but I can’t hold it back any longer!</verse>
				<verse number="10">For I heard them whispering behind my back: “Terror everywhere! That’s all he prophesies. ” All my close friends watch for me to fall. “Let’s turn him in to the authorities,” they say. “Perhaps we can set a trap for him. Finally, we will prevail over him and take our revenge on him.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">But Yahweh is a mighty, fearless warrior standing at my side. My persecutors are the ones who will fall down and fail; disgraced by their failure, they will not succeed. Their shame will stick to them forever.</verse>
				<verse number="12">O  Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, you test the righteous. You probe my deepest thoughts and motives. I have committed my cause to you, so let me watch as you take revenge on my enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Sing! Sing praises to Yahweh, for he rescues the soul of the needy from the power of the wicked.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Cursed be the day on which I was born! The day when my mother bore me, may that day never be blessed!</verse>
				<verse number="15">Put a curse on the man who made my father glad by saying, “Good news—it’s a boy! You have a son.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Let that man be like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah that Yahweh destroyed without pity. Let him hear shouts of alarm in the morning and battle cries at noon.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For he did not kill me before I came from the womb, making my pregnant mother’s womb my grave forever.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Why was I even born? Was it just to experience toil and sorrow and spend my days in shame?</verse>

			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">Judah’s King Zedekiah sent for Pashhur son of Malchiah and for a priest named Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and he told them, “Tell Jeremiah to intercede for us to Yahweh because Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, is coming to war against us. Perhaps Yahweh will perform an extraordinary miracle for us, as he has done in times past, and cause the king of Babylon to withdraw from us.” Yahweh spoke through Jeremiah to say to them, “Tell King Zedekiah,</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">‘Here is what Yahweh, the God of Israel says to King Zedekiah: Behold! I am going to take the weapons your troops are using to fight the Babylonians who are outside the city, and I will gather them together there.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And I myself will fight against you with a strong arm and with all my might. Yes, I will fight against you, fueled by my furious anger and by my great wrath!</verse>
				<verse number="6">And I will strike down the inhabitants of this city—both people and animals, and they will die from a great plague.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“ ‘And after this, declares Yahweh, I will hand over Judah’s king, Zedekiah, his officials, and everyone else in the city who survives the disease, war, and food shortages, to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and their enemies. He will slaughter them with the sword and show no mercy, pity, or compassion.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Furthermore, speak to the people the words of Yahweh: ‘Behold! I will set before you the way that leads to life and the way that leads to death.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Whoever remains in this city will die by the sword and by food shortages and by pestilence, but whoever goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live, and they will escape with their lives.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“ ‘For I am determined to bring calamity to this city, not good, declares Yahweh. I will turn the city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it to the ground.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh spoke through Jeremiah to the household of the king: “Hear the word of Yahweh,</verse>
				<verse number="12">royal family of David. Here is what Yahweh says to you: Each new day, make sure that justice is done and rescue those who have been robbed from the power of their oppressor, or my wrath will go forth like an unquenchable fire on account of their evil deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh declares: I will fight against you, Jerusalem, you who are enthroned above the valley, a rock over the plain. Those who say, ‘Who would dare come here and attack us and penetrate the defenses of our city?’</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will punish you as your evil deeds deserve, declares Yahweh. And I will kindle a fire in your forest, and it will consume everything around you.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke these words to Jeremiah: “Go to the palace of the king of Judah and give him my word.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Say: ‘Listen to the word of Yahweh, king of Judah, who occupies the throne of David, your officials, and people who enter these gates!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh says to you: Be concerned for justice and righteousness. Rescue the one who is robbed from his oppressor. Do not exploit or mistreat the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow. Stop the violence and do not shed the blood of the innocent in this place.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For if you fulfill this command, then there will be kings of David’s lineage to pass through the city’s gates. The kings and their officials will be riding in chariots or riding horses and will be accompanied by the people.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But I swear by myself as a witness, if you do not obey these commands, then this palace shall become a ruin, declares Yahweh!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Yes, listen to what Yahweh thinks about Judah’s royal palace: “You are as glorious as Gilead to me, as beautiful as the summit of Lebanon; but I swear that I will make you as empty as a desert— like a ghost town.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will appoint a wrecking crew to destroy you, each member with his weapons and tools. They will cut down your pillars of choice cedar and set them on fire.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“When many foreigners pass by this city and each one asks another, ‘Why did Yahweh do this to such a great city?’</verse>
				<verse number="9">the reply will be, ‘Because they forsook the covenant with Yahweh their God and worshiped and served other gods.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Do not weep for King Josiah, who died, and do not mourn for him; rather, weep bitterly for King Jehoahaz, who is carried away as a captive, for he will never return to see the land of his birth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For this is what Yahweh has said concerning Shallum son of King Josiah of Judah, who succeeded his father Josiah as king but was led away from here: “He will never return.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He will die in the land of his exile, and he will never see his homeland again.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Doomed is the one who builds his house with unrighteousness, and the upper chambers of his palace with injustice, who compels his fellow man to work for nothing and pays him no wages for his hard labor.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Doomed is the one who says, ‘I’ll build a vast palace for myself with spacious upper chambers and large windows. I’ll panel it with cedar and paint it red.’</verse>
				<verse number="15">Does it make you a king just because you build a finer house of cedar than others? Your father lived a satisfying life, yet he dispensed justice and righteousness— and because of this, all went well with him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He upheld the rights of the poor and needy— and look how well he did. Whoever lives this way shows that he knows me,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“But your eyes and heart are only interested in what brings you unjust profit, in violently oppressing your people even if it means shedding innocent blood.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Therefore, Yahweh says to you, Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah: “No one will cry at your funeral or say, ‘How terrible! How sad!’ No one will weep for you or say, ‘How sad! Why did his majesty have to die?’</verse>
				<verse number="19">He will have a donkey’s burial. He will be dragged outside the gates of Jerusalem and left on the ground to rot.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Go up to the peaks of Lebanon, you people of Jerusalem, and cry out. Raise your voice in the heights of Bashan, cry out from the mountains of Moab, for all your lovers, the nations you trusted in, are crushed.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I warned you in your prosperous times, but you said, ‘I don’t want to hear it.’ You have treated me like that ever since your youth, refusing to listen to me.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Now you will be disgraced and humiliated because of all your evil. Your leaders will be swept away like dust in the wind, and your lovers, the nations you trusted in, will be captured and dragged into captivity.</verse>
				<verse number="23">You, O  king, although you feel safely nested there in your palace of cedar pillars from Lebanon, you will be in pain and will groan like a woman giving birth!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Yahweh declares, “As surely as I am the living God, listen, O King Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah. Even if you were the royal signet ring I wear on my right hand, I would still pull you from my finger.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I will hand you over to the power of those who seek your life, into the hands of those you dread—King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and the Babylonians.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into a foreign land, where neither of you were born and where both of you will die.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Your people will be in exile and will not return to the land to which they yearn to come back.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Is this man Coniah now thrown away like a worthless, broken pot that no one wants? Why are he and his offspring hurled out and taken away to a land they knew not?</verse>
				<verse number="29">Land of Judah! My land! My land! Hear the word of Yahweh!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Yahweh decrees: “List this man as ‘Childless,’ one who will never succeed in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will be accepted to sit on the throne of David and rule in Judah again.”</verse>

			<chapter number="23">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh declares, “Doomed are the shepherds who scatter the sheep of my pasture and cause them to be destroyed!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh, the God of Israel, say to the shepherds of my people: You have scattered my flock, driven them away, and failed to take care of them. So, I will be sure to take care of you and deal with you for your evil,” Yahweh declares.</verse>
				<verse number="3">“But I will gather the remnant of my flock from all the countries where I have scattered them and will bring them back to their folds where they will thrive and increase in number.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yahweh declares, “I will raise up faithful shepherds to shepherd them; ones who will really care for them. There will be no more fear or terror for them anymore, and not one will be missing.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Listen to me! I, the Lord, promise you that a time is coming when I will raise up a righteous Branch, who will sprout from David’s lineage. He will rule as their King, and his reign will prosper with wisdom and understanding. He will succeed in bringing justice and righteousness to all.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Under his rule, Judah and Israel will be kept safe and secure. He will be known by this name: Yahweh, Our Righteousness!</verse>
				<verse number="7">“So I, Yahweh, declare that a day is coming when people will no longer say, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought the Israelites out of Egypt,’</verse>
				<verse number="8">but rather, ‘As surely as Yahweh lives, who brought the Israelites back from the land of the north and from all the lands to which he had banished them.’ Then they will dwell in their own land.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Concerning the prophets: my heart is broken within me, and all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome with wine. I’m overcome by the wine of Yahweh, and his holy words spoken to me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The land is full of people unfaithful to him; they lead wicked lives and misuse their power. Because of a curse, the land is in mourning, and the pastures of the wilderness have dried up.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh declares, “Even the prophets and priests are ungodly! I have seen their wickedness in my own temple.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So the paths they take will be dark and slippery. Certainly, they will stumble in the dark and fall headlong.” Yahweh declares, “I will bring disaster on them when the time for punishment comes.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The prophets of Samaria were disgusting to me! They prophesied in the name of Baal and led my people Israel astray.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And I have seen the prophets of Jerusalem do horrible acts: adultery, persistent lying, and promoting the cause of the wicked, so that no one renounces his evil ways. To me, they are all depraved like Sodom, and the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, say this about the prophets: The prophets of Jerusalem have spewed their spiritual poison throughout the land. Therefore, I will make them drink poisoned water and feed them bitter food.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, say: Ignore what those prophets prophesy to you; they are deluding you and imagining visions of their own, and not what comes from the mouth of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“They keep saying to those who despise me, ‘ Yahweh has spoken: You will have peace!’ And to those who follow their own stubborn ways, they prophesy, ‘No disaster will touch you.’</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Yet which of these prophets ever stood in Yahweh ’s council to hear and receive his word? Who has truly heard and paid attention to his message?</verse>
				<verse number="19">Behold, Yahweh ’s anger is like the fury of a fearsome whirlwind about to hit the wicked head-on with gale-force winds.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yahweh ’s anger will not relent until he has perfectly carried out what he has in mind. In the latter days, you will clearly understand this.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yahweh says: “I did not send these so-called prophets, yet they ran eagerly to prophesy their message. I did not speak to them, yet they claimed to prophesy in my name.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Had they been present in my divine council and heard my words, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and caused them to turn from their evil ways and their wicked deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“Am I just a God nearby,” demands Yahweh, “and not a God who is both near and far away?</verse>
				<verse number="24">Can anyone hide somewhere in secret where I do not see him?” declares Yahweh. “Is there anywhere in heaven or on earth where I am not present?” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“I have heard the lies of those prophets who claim to have received a message from me. ‘I dreamed a dream,’ they say, ‘I dreamed a dream!’</verse>
				<verse number="26">How long must this go on? These prophets of falsehood preach illusions from their own minds.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Their dreams, by which one tries to outdo the other, make my people forget me just as their ancestors forgot me in favor of Baal.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let the one who has my word speak my word faithfully. For what do straw and grain have in common?” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Is not my word like a mighty fire? Is it not like a powerful hammer shattering a rock in pieces?” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="30">“So then I, Yahweh, affirm that I am against the prophets who steal prophetic words from someone else and yet affirm that they came from me!</verse>
				<verse number="31">I am against the lying prophets who make up their prophecies and say, ‘Thus says the Lord!’</verse>
				<verse number="32">I am against the prophets who boast in their lies,” declares Yahweh. “They lead my people astray by their lying prophecies, dreams, and exaggerations. I affirm that I never sent them or commissioned them; they are no good at all for these people,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“ Jeremiah, when these people, a prophet, or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of Yahweh ’s heart?’ you must answer, ‘ Yahweh declares, “ You are my burden, and I will cast you aside!” ’</verse>
				<verse number="34">“If any of you flippantly says, ‘This is Yahweh ’s message,’ I will punish you and your household, even if you are a prophet or a priest.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Instead, you must ask each other, ‘What has Yahweh said?’ or ‘What is Yahweh ’s answer?’</verse>
				<verse number="36">But stop using the expression ‘This is Yahweh ’s message,’ for their message is nothing more than their own opinion. Otherwise, you distort the words of Yahweh our God, the living God, the Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="37">“This is the way to speak to a prophet: ‘What has Yahweh said?’ or ‘What answer has Yahweh given you?’</verse>
				<verse number="38">But if you disobey me and say, ‘The message of Yahweh,’ though I spoke to you and told you not to say, ‘The message of Yahweh,’</verse>
				<verse number="39">then believe me, I will pick you up and fling you from my presence. And I will also do the same thing to the city I gave to you and your ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="40">I will bring down everlasting shame on you, everlasting disgrace that will never be forgotten.”</verse>

			<chapter number="24">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh opened my eyes to see a supernatural vision. It happened after King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had taken into captivity Jehoiakim’s son King Jeconiah, his officials, and all artisans and skilled workers and brought them to Babylon. In this vision, I saw two baskets of figs placed in front of Yahweh ’s temple.</verse>
				<verse number="2">One basket was full of excellent figs that ripened early, and the other was full of rotten figs that were not fit to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Jeremiah,” Yahweh asked, “what do you see?” “Figs,” I said. “Some are very good, but the others are very bad, too rotten to eat.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Yahweh replied,</verse>
				<verse number="5">“This is what I, Yahweh, the God of Israel, say to you: ‘The good figs are the people of Judah whom I sent away in exile to Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="6">My eyes will compassionately watch over them for their good, to bring them back to this land, to build them up and not to tear them down, to plant them and not to uproot them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will give them a willing heart to know that I am Yahweh. They will be my beloved people, and I will be their loving God, for they will return to me with every passion of their heart.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“ ‘As for the bad figs that were too rotten to eat, they represent King Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, and all the others left in Jerusalem who were not taken away to Babylon, whether they stayed here in Judah or went to live in Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I will punish them with such a disaster that everyone on earth will tremble in horror when they hear about it. I will force the people of Judah to go to foreign countries, where they will be an object of scorn, cursing, and insult.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I will send the sword, food shortages, and plague against them until they have vanished from the land I gave to them and their ancestors.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="25">
				<verse number="1">This is the message that came to Jeremiah about the people of Judah. He received this prophecy in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah and the first year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign in Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="3">“For the last twenty-three years, ever since the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon was king, I have been warning you and continually prophesying to you the words of Yahweh, but you have not listened.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Additionally, Yahweh has sent all his servants the prophets to you over and over again, but still you have neither listened nor humbled your hearts to pay attention to them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They told you, ‘If you turn, each person, from your evil ways and from your evil doings, Yahweh will let you remain in the land that he gave you and your ancestors for all time.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Do not run after other gods to serve and worship them.’ “ ‘Do not provoke me to anger by worshiping idols your own hands have made, and I will do you no harm,’</verse>
				<verse number="7">declares Yahweh. ‘But you have not listened to me and have provoked my anger by worshiping idols your own hands have made, to your own harm.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Therefore, because you have not listened to my words, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says:</verse>
				<verse number="9">‘Behold, I will summon my servant Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, along with all the northern armies, and bring them to fight against this land, its people, and all these surrounding nations. I will devote them to destruction and make them a desolation. I will turn them into ruins forever. Everyone will be utterly astonished by the sight of what I have done to them.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Moreover, I will banish the voices of celebration and laughter from them and the sweet voices of the groom and his bride. I will silence the noise of grinding grain in the morning, and in the evening, lamps will no longer burn in their homes.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The entire region will become a ruin, empty as a desert, and these nations will be carried off to Babylon to serve her king for seventy years.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“ ‘Then, after seventy years, I will punish the king of Babylon and the land of the Chaldeans for their sin,’ declares Yahweh. ‘I will make their land desolate forever.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I will bring against that land all my words of warning that I have spoken against it, everything written in this scroll, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Indeed, I will pay back the Babylonians for every wrong they have done. Great kings from many other nations will conquer the mighty Babylonians and will even make slaves of them.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh, Israel’s God, spoke these words to me: “ Jeremiah, take this cup from my hand; it is the cup of the wine of my wrath. Make all the nations to whom I send you drink from it.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They will stagger as drunkards and lose their minds because of the massacres I am sending among them.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">So I took the cup from Yahweh ’s hand and made all the nations to whom Yahweh sent me drink from it.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I started with Jerusalem and the cities of Judah. Their kings and leaders were removed from power in disgrace and made an object of horror, derision, and a curse, as they are today.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then I went to Egypt to her king, Pharaoh, his officials, his leaders, and all the Egyptians,</verse>
				<verse number="20">and all foreigners who lived there, and they, too, drank from the cup. Next, I went to all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of the territory of the Philistines, of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and what was still left of Ashdod.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then, I went to the kings of Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites;</verse>
				<verse number="22">the kings of Tyre, the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the Mediterranean lands.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Afterward, I went to the cities of Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all the desert tribes of Arabia,</verse>
				<verse number="24">all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed people groups who live in the desert,</verse>
				<verse number="25">all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media,</verse>
				<verse number="26">all the kings of the north, near and far, one after another, to all the kingdoms of the earth. As for the king of Babylon, he will drink from the cup last of all.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“You will say to each one, ‘ Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, the God of Israel, says to you: Drink from this cup that is full of the wine of my wrath. Vomit, fall over, and rise no more. And when I send war against the nations, you will be completely defeated.’</verse>
				<verse number="28">“If they refuse to drink from the cup from your hand, you will say to them, ‘ Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says this: You have no choice —drink!</verse>
				<verse number="29">For take note, starting with the city called by my own name, Jerusalem, everyone on earth will suffer from war. So there is no way I will let you escape unpunished, declares Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.’</verse>
				<verse number="30">“ Jeremiah, you must prophesy all these words to them: “ ‘ Yahweh roars from heaven’s heights; his voice thunders from his holy dwelling place. He roars mightily against his people, and his shout will be like those who tread grapes— a shout that echoes to the ends of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The noise will resound over all the earth. For Yahweh declares: I am indicting the nations, bringing all humanity to trial, and sentencing the wicked to death.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, decrees: “Behold, disaster is spreading from nation to nation. My anger, like a perfect storm, is rising from the far ends of the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Those whom Yahweh slaughters that day will be from all over the earth, and no one will mourn for them. No one will gather their bodies or bury them; they will lie as dung on the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Howl, you shepherds, wail in sorrow, and roll on the ground, you leaders of the flock, for your day has come to be slaughtered like sheep. You will fall and be scattered, like pieces of broken pottery.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Shepherds, you have nowhere to hide, nowhere to run, you leaders of the flock.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Listen as the shepherds cry out in distress! Listen as the leaders of the flock wail in sorrow! For Yahweh has laid their pasture waste,</verse>
				<verse number="37">and their peaceful meadows are reduced to silence because of Yahweh ’s furious anger.</verse>
				<verse number="38">The lion has left his lair, and their land is left a wasteland because of the sword of the oppressor and because of his fierce anger.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="26">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke these words to Jeremiah at the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh said to me, “Stand in the court of my house, the temple, and announce what I tell you to say to the crowds coming to worship me from the cities of Judah. Do not leave out anything or hold back a word.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Perhaps they will listen, and they will all turn from their evil ways. If so, I will relent and not bring the impending disaster I have planned for them because of their evil deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Give them this warning: ‘ Yahweh says: If you will not listen to me and obey the instructions that I have given you</verse>
				<verse number="5">or heed the words of my servants the prophets, whom I keep sending to you even though you have not obeyed them,</verse>
				<verse number="6">then I will make this temple into a pile of ruins just like I did to Shiloh. This city will become a worldwide object of cursing.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="7">The priests, prophets, and all the people heard what Jeremiah said in the temple court of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="8">When Jeremiah had finished speaking the message Yahweh had ordered him to give to the people, all the priests, prophets, and people forcefully seized him and said, “You ought to be killed for this!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Why have you prophesied in Yahweh ’s name, ‘This temple will become a pile of ruins like Shiloh, and Jerusalem become an uninhabited ruin?’ ” Then a mob formed and ganged up against Jeremiah in the temple court of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Upon hearing about this, the leaders of Judah went up from the royal palace to the temple of Yahweh and took their seats to hold court at the gate of Yahweh ’s temple.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then the priests and prophets said to the leaders and all the people, “This man deserves to die, since he has prophesied horrible things against this city, which you yourselves have heard.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Jeremiah defended himself before all the leaders and the people, saying, “ Yahweh himself sent me to prophesy this message you have heard me speak against this temple and this city.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But if you stop doing evil, change your ways, and obey the voice of Yahweh your God, then Yahweh will stop the impending disaster and relent of what he has decreed against you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">As for me, I am in your hands. Do with me whatever seems right to you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Only be sure of this: if you put me to death, you will be bringing innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its people, since Yahweh has truly sent me to bring you the warning you have heard.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then all the leaders and the people said to the priests and prophets, “This man does not deserve to die, for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">And some of the elders of the nation then stood to address the crowd:</verse>
				<verse number="18">“In the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, the prophet Micah of Moresheth prophesied to all the people of Judah, ‘ Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, declares: “ ‘Zion will be plowed under like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, and the Temple Mount will be covered with overgrowth.’</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Did King Hezekiah and the people of Judah sentence Micah to death for prophesying this? Did not the king rather fear Yahweh, humble himself, and plead earnestly with him so that he relented of the disaster that he had decreed against them? Do we really want to bring a disaster upon ourselves with such a crime?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">There was another prophet in those day who prophesied in Yahweh ’s name, Uriah son of Shemaiah, from Kiriath Jearim. He prophesied the same things against Judah and Jerusalem as Jeremiah.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When King Jehoiakim and all his leaders and mighty men heard what Uriah prophesied, the king was determined to put him to death. On hearing this, he was afraid and escaped to Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="22">King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Achbor to Egypt with others,</verse>
				<verse number="23">who brought Uriah back from Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim. The king executed Uriah with the sword and had his body thrown into the common burial ground.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Nevertheless Jeremiah escaped execution—but only because Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, protected him and would not allow him to be handed over to the furious crowd.</verse>

			<chapter number="27">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke these words to Jeremiah at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah.</verse>

				<verse number="6">Now I have given all your countries to my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I have even given him the wild animals to serve him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">All nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson —until the time of the fall of his own kingdom comes, when other nations and great kings will make him their servant.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The nation or kingdom that refuses to submit to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and does not put its neck into the harness of the yoke to serve the king, I will punish,” declares Yahweh. “I will punish it with the sword, food shortages, and pestilence until I have let Nebuchadnezzar completely destroy it.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“ ‘ “Do not listen to your prophets; they are false. Do not listen to your fortune tellers, dream interpreters, mediums, sorcerers, and magicians who say to you, ‘The king of Babylon will not conquer you.’</verse>
				<verse number="10">They are prophesying lies to you; do not believe them! They open the door for your enemies to take you away. I will drive you out of your land, and you will perish.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But the nation that harnesses herself to the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, I will allow her to live and farm her land,” declares Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="12">I, Jeremiah, also delivered a similar message to King Zedekiah of Judah: “You must harness yourself to the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and you will live.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Otherwise you will die together with your people by sword, food shortages, and pestilence, as Yahweh has threatened any nation that does not serve the king of Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Pay no attention to the words of the prophets who say to you, ‘Do not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they prophesy lies to you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">‘I have not sent them,’ declares Yahweh. ‘They lie when they affirm that they are speaking in my name. If you listen to them, I will drive you out. You will be destroyed—you and the prophets who are lying to you.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="16">And to the priests and to all the people I said: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who lie to you, saying, ‘The holy vessels plundered from Yahweh ’s temple are going to be brought back to you soon from Babylon,’ for they prophesy falsely to you, declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Do not listen to them! Serve the king of Babylon and live a long life. Why should Jerusalem be destroyed?</verse>
				<verse number="18">If they are true prophets and the word of Yahweh is in them, let them intercede with Yahweh, the Commander of Angel Armies, so that the furnishings that are still left in Yahweh ’s temple, in the king’s palace, and in Jerusalem may not be carried off to Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="19">That’s because Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has already spoken about the temple furnishings that remain in the city—the bronze pillars, the large bronze basin, the stands, and all the other bowls and chalices.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn’t take them away when he took captive Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim to Babylon along with all the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For the God of Israel, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, said that the furnishings left behind in Yahweh ’s temple, in the royal palace, and in Jerusalem</verse>
				<verse number="22">will be carried off to Babylon, and ‘they will stay there until the day that I restore them and bring them back where they belong,’ declares Yahweh.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="28">
				<verse number="1">That same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, a Gibeonite, spoke to me in the temple of Yahweh in the presence of the priests and of all the people:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“ Yahweh, the God of Israel, the Commander of Angel Armies, says, ‘I have shattered the yoke of the king of Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Within two years, I will return all the temple treasures of Yahweh that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon carried off from here and took to Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And I will also bring back Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who have gone to Babylon.’ For Yahweh declares, ‘I will shatter the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Jeremiah the prophet replied to Hananiah the prophet in front of the priests and all the people who had come to worship at the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“So be it! May he fulfill the words that you have prophesied and return all the temple treasures of Yahweh and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Nevertheless, listen to this word that I speak to you and the people:</verse>
				<verse number="8">From ancient times, the prophets who preceded you and me prophesied war, disaster, and plague against many countries and great kingdoms.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But when a prophet prophesies peace, wait to see if his words come true; then you will have proof that Yahweh had truly sent him.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">All at once, the prophet Hananiah snatched the yoke off Jeremiah’s neck and broke it.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And in front of all the people, Hananiah said, “Hear the word of Yahweh: ‘Just as I broke this yoke, so Yahweh will free all the nations from the power of King Nebuchadnezzar within two years.’ ” At this, the prophet Jeremiah walked away.</verse>
				<verse number="12">After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke around Jeremiah’s neck, Yahweh gave Jeremiah this message:</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Go back and inform Hananiah, ‘ Yahweh has told me that, indeed, you have broken wooden bars only to forge iron bars in their place.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For Yahweh, the God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says: I now lay on the necks of all these nations a heavy iron yoke to enslave them to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. They will be enslaved to him; I will even make the wild animals serve him!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, “You had better listen, Hananiah. Yahweh has not sent you; you have misled the people to trust in a lie.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And so, Yahweh declares, ‘I will remove you from the face of the earth. You will die this year because you have preached rebellion against Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="17">The prophet Hananiah died the same year, in the seventh month.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="29">
				<verse number="1">This is the open letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders in exile, to the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had deported from Jerusalem to Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="2">(Among the exiles were King Jeconiah, Nehushta the queen mother, the high-ranking officials, the leading men of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen and metalworkers.)</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jeremiah entrusted the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah had sent to Babylon, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. The letter read as follows:</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yahweh, the God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says to all the exiles deported from Jerusalem to Babylon:</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Build houses and settle in the land. Plant gardens and eat their produce.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Get married and have children; encourage your sons and daughters to get married and raise families. Flourish in your captivity, for you must increase and not decrease.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Work for the good of the city to which I have exiled you. And pray to Yahweh, asking for a blessing on your city since your peace depends on its peace.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">For Yahweh, the God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says: “Do not be deceived by the false prophets in your midst or by those who presume to know the future. Pay no attention to their dreams,</verse>
				<verse number="9">for,” Yahweh declares, “they prophesy lies to you in my name, and I have not sent them.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I say to you: After Babylon has ruled over you for seventy years, I will show compassion to you and will fulfill my promise of giving you good things, and I will bring you back to your land.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Here’s what Yahweh says to you: “I know all about the marvelous destiny I have in store for you, a future planned out in detail. My intention is not to harm you but to surround you with peace and prosperity and to give you a beautiful future, glistening with hope.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When you call on me and come to me in prayer, I will listen to your every word.</verse>
				<verse number="13">If you reach out to me, you will find me when you search for me with all your heart.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will not disappoint you,” declares Yahweh. “ All that you have lost, I will restore, and I will regather you from all the nations where I have scattered you. I will bring you back home to the land from which I exiled you,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh says all these things to you because you claim that he has raised up prophets for you in Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="16">This is what Yahweh says about David’s descendant, King Zedekiah, and all the people living in this city, your relatives who were not taken away as prisoners with you:</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says: “I am now going to send catastrophe to them—war, food shortages, and plague. I will make them like worthless figs, so rotten they cannot be eaten.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I will make them into a horrible sight to all the earth, a curse, a thing of horror, scorn, and derision to all the nations where I have driven them. I will afflict them with war, food shortages, and plague</verse>
				<verse number="19">because they have refused to listen to my words,” declares Yahweh, “although I have sent all my servants the prophets to them over and over, but still they closed their ears,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“So pay attention, you exiles, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon, to what I, Yahweh, have said!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says about Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah. He says, “These men are telling you lies in my name. Therefore, I will hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and he will have them put to death before your eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And in the future, when the people of Judah who are exiles in Babylon want to put a curse on someone, they will say, ‘I pray that Yahweh kills you in the same way the king of Babylon burned Zedekiah and Ahab to death!’</verse>
				<verse number="23">For they have done outrageous scandals in Israel, committing adultery with other men’s wives and speaking lying words in my name that I never spoke to them. I know all that they have done and am a witness against them. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">“This is what you should say to Shemaiah of Nehelam:</verse>
				<verse number="25">Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says: You have taken it upon yourself to write letters to all the people in Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah and to all the priests. Your letter states,</verse>
				<verse number="26">‘After the death of Jehoiada the priest, Yahweh chose you to be the priest in charge of the temple security. You know that anyone who acts crazy and pretends to be a prophet should be arrested and put in chains and iron collars.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Why, then, haven’t you done this to Jeremiah of Anathoth, who is now posing as a prophet to the people?</verse>
				<verse number="28">He even sent us a letter in Babylon, saying: You’ll be there a long time, so build houses, settle down, plant gardens, and eat what they produce.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Now, when the priest Zephaniah had read this letter to Jeremiah,</verse>
				<verse number="30">Yahweh said to Jeremiah,</verse>
				<verse number="31">“Send another letter to all the exiles in Babylon: I, Yahweh, have not chosen Shemaiah of Nehelam to be one of my prophets, and he has misled you by telling lies in my name.</verse>
				<verse number="32">He has even stirred up rebellion against me. Therefore, I will punish Shemaiah. He and his descendants will not live to see the good things I will do for my people. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="30">
				<verse number="1">This is the message that Yahweh gave to Jeremiah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave Jeremiah this command: “Write everything I have told you in a book.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For I decree that the time is coming when I will restore all that you have lost and bring back my captive people, Israel and Judah,” says Yahweh. “I will bring them back to possess the land that I gave to their ancestors.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Yahweh told me to say to Israel and Judah: “I, Yahweh, hear the voice of panic, the screams of terror, and no sound of peace anywhere.</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6">Now, ask yourself this and carefully consider: can a man give birth to a child? Then why do I see each man gripping his sides like a woman in labor? How terrible! Why has every face turned pale?</verse>
				<verse number="7">A disaster! A terrible day like no other. It will be great tribulation for Jacob, yet he will be saved out of it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“In that day,” declares Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, “I will break off the yoke from your neck and snap your chains, and foreigners will no longer enslave you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But Israel and Judah will be servants of Yahweh their God, and I will raise up a king for them from the lineage of David.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yahweh says, “My servant Jacob, do not fear; Israel, do not be alarmed. I will rescue you and your descendants from that foreign land in which you are held captive. You will return and live in peace, safe and secure, with no one to trouble you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For I am with you and will save you,” Yahweh declares. “Someday, I will bring destruction to all the nations where I have driven you, but I will not destroy you. I will discipline you but in moderation. I will not let you go entirely unpunished.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yahweh says: “Your wound is incurable; your injuries are so serious, they’re beyond healing.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Everyone has given up on you. At least for an ulcer there are remedies, but for you, there’s no cure at all.</verse>
				<verse number="14">All those ‘lovers’ you had have abandoned you; they could not care less. Yes, I struck you with cruel punishment because of your great guilt and countless sins. I struck you mercilessly like you were my enemy.</verse>
				<verse number="15">There is no point in crying out over your pain, for your wound is incurable. I have treated you like this because of your great guilt and countless sins.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“But rest assured, all those who devoured you will be devoured; all your enemies, every one of them, will go into captivity. Those who devastated you will be devastated, and all who made you their prey, I will make a prey.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For I, Yahweh, say to you who were once called ‘Outcast,’ I will heal your wounds. And to you who were once called ‘Forgotten Zion,’ I will restore your health.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Yahweh says: “See, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob and have compassion on his families. The city will be rebuilt on its mound with the city fortress in its rightful place.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Out of them will be heard the joyous songs of thanksgiving and the raucous shouts of joy. I will cause them to flourish and not diminish. I will bring them honor, and they will not be humiliated.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Their descendants will be just like they were before. Their community will be fixed firmly before me, and I shall punish all their oppressors.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Their majestic prince will be one of their own. Their ruler will arise from among them, and I will give him free and easy access to me. For who is he who will pledge his heart to remain close to me?” Yahweh asks.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“You will be my very own people, and I shall be your very own God.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Behold, Yahweh ’s anger is like the fury of a fearsome whirlwind about to hit the wicked head-on with gale-force winds.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Yahweh ’s anger will not relent until he has perfectly carried out what he has in mind. In the latter days, you will clearly understand this.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="31">
				<verse number="1">“At that time,” Yahweh declares, “I will be the true God of every family of Israel, and they will be my very own people.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh says: “My people who survived the slaughter and the sword found grace in their difficult wilderness. I am bringing Israel to her rest.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh appeared to me from another realm and said, “I have deeply loved you with a forever-love; that is why I have been so patient and kind to draw you to my heart.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You are precious to me, and I will build you up again. Yes, Israel, you will be rebuilt! Once more, you will be decked out in your best attire, take up your tambourines, and go out dancing with great joy.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Once more you will plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria, and those who plant them will enjoy the fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Yes, there will be a day when the watchmen cry out on the mountains of Samaria, ‘Come on! Let’s go up to Zion to meet with Yahweh our God and worship him!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="7">For Yahweh says: “Sing with joyous delight for Israel! Yes, shout out praise for the foremost of the nations. ‘ Yahweh, save your people, the remnant of Israel. Proclaim the news! Praise him! Shout it out!’</verse>
				<verse number="8">Watch, as I bring them back from the land of the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. Even the blind and the lame will be among them. Expectant mothers, women about to give birth, will come and be a part of that great homecoming.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They will return praying with tears as I lead them home. I will guide them to streams of water, by a smooth path where they will not stumble. For I am Israel’s Father, and Ephraim is my firstborn son.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Listen, nations, to the word of Yahweh. Proclaim it on the distant coastlands, saying, ‘He who scattered Israel will gather him. Like a shepherd guards his flock, Yahweh watches over his people.’</verse>
				<verse number="11">For Yahweh has ransomed the people of Israel and rescued them from an enemy stronger than themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="12">They will come, singing for joy on the heights of Zion, and the goodness of Yahweh will make them radiant. Yahweh will bless them with grain, new wine, olive oil, flocks, and herds. They will be prosperous and grow like a well-watered garden, with no reason to be discouraged.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The young girls, the young men, and the elderly will dance and celebrate together. I will turn their sad memories into gladness. I will give them joy after all their trouble and will be their comfort.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yahweh says, “I will refresh the desire of my priests with abundance and lavish gifts on my people until they are more than satisfied.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh says, “In Ramah voices are crying; it is the sound of wailing and bitter weeping. Rachel is mourning for her children, and she refuses to let anyone comfort her over her loss, because her children are no more.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yahweh says, “Stop weeping and wipe away your tears! For I will reward you for raising your children,” declares Yahweh, “and they will return from the land of their enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="17">There is a door of hope for your future after all, your children will return to their homeland,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“I have heard it! The people of Israel moaning, ‘You disciplined us like young, untamed bulls, but you broke us, and we’ve learned to obey. Bring us back, Yahweh; let us come home, for you are our God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Although we turned away, we have repented. You made us aware of our guilt, and we hung our heads, for we were deeply ashamed and humiliated, and we bear the disgrace of our youth.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yahweh replies, “Ephraim, you are still my child no matter what you’ve done; you are still my beloved children, my very precious children. Even though I rebuke you, my thoughts are filled with love. That is why I am so deeply moved with compassion, for I long for you and have mercy in my heart for you,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Set up your signposts and road markers to find your way home. Take note of the pathway, and remember the road by which you went. Come home, my beloved Israel; return to your own cities.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Faithless one, how long will you hesitate? For Yahweh is creating something new on earth. A woman will rescue a warrior!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Yahweh, the God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says, “This blessing will once again be heard throughout Judah and its towns when I bring their captives home: “ ‘May Yahweh bless the Holy Place where he lives, O holy mountain of Jerusalem!’</verse>
				<verse number="24">“People throughout Judah and her towns will live together in peace, both the farmers and shepherds with their flocks.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For I will refresh the weary soul and satisfy all those who have given up on life.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">At this, I awoke and realized that my sleep had been sweet to me.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Look, the days are coming,” Yahweh declares, “when I will repopulate the land of Israel and Judah with both people and livestock.</verse>
				<verse number="28">I have watched over them to uproot, to knock down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring calamity, so now, I will carefully watch over them as they start over again and rebuild. And I will help them grow,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="29">“In those days, people will no longer quote the proverb: ‘Children must pay the consequences of their fathers’ sins.’</verse>
				<verse number="30">“Rather, everyone who eats sour grapes will have a stomachache. Each one will be responsible for their own sins.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Yahweh declares: “Look, the days are coming when I will enter into a brand-new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="32">It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt. They broke that covenant even though I was their husband,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“No, this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel when the time has come,” declares Yahweh. “I will embed my law into the core of their being and write it on their hearts and minds. Then I will truly be their God, and they will truly be my people.</verse>
				<verse number="34">None of them will have to teach their friends or family, saying, ‘Come and know Yahweh intimately!’ No, from the least to the greatest, they will all know me intimately,” Yahweh declares, “for I will remove their guilt and wipe their sin from my memory.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">“I am Yahweh All-Powerful. I declare to you: I order the sun to light up the day, the stars and moon to brighten the night. I stir the sea and make the ocean waves roar. My name is Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Just as this established order will not pass away, so I will never let Israel cease from being a nation. “I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="37">It is impossible for you to measure the heavens above or to fathom the foundations of the earth below. In the same way, it is impossible for me to reject my people Israel, no matter what they have done,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="38">“Look, the days are coming when the people will rebuild Jerusalem for me,” declares Yahweh. “ They will rebuild it from the northeast Tower of Hananel to the northwest Corner Gate.</verse>
				<verse number="39">And the measuring line will stretch out farther to the Gareb Hill, turning then to Goah.</verse>
				<verse number="40">And the entire Hinnom Valley, with its bones and ashes, and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate eastward, will be consecrated and sacred to Yahweh. Jerusalem will never be overthrown or destroyed again.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="32">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me in the tenth year of Zedekiah’s reign in Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign.</verse>
				<verse number="2">At that time, the Babylonian army was attacking Jerusalem, and I was confined in the king’s palace guardhouse.</verse>
				<verse number="3">King Zedekiah had imprisoned me because I had prophesied Yahweh ’s message: “I am Yahweh, and I am about to let the king of Babylonia conquer Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="4">King Zedekiah will not escape but will be captured and taken to the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, who will see him face-to-face and speak with him in person.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Zedekiah will be taken captive to Babylon, where he will remain until I am finished with him. If you fight against the Babylonians, you will not succeed. For I, Yahweh, have decreed it.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then Yahweh spoke to me and said,</verse>
				<verse number="7">“ Your cousin Hanamel, son of your uncle Shallum, will come to you and say: ‘Buy my field at Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to purchase it.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">And it happened just as Yahweh had said. My cousin Hanamel came to me in the palace guardhouse and said, “Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. As my nearest relative, you have the right of possession and redemption, so buy it.” Then I knew that this was Yahweh ’s plan.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So I bought the field from my cousin Hanamel at Anathoth and weighed out the purchase price to him of seventeen silver shekels.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I signed the deed and sealed it, called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on the scales.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then I took both the sealed deed of purchase (with the price and conditions of the sale) and the unsealed copy,</verse>
				<verse number="12">and I handed them over to Baruch son of Neriah, grandson of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel. The witnesses who had signed the deed of purchase and all the people who happened to be in the palace guardhouse were gathered there.</verse>
				<verse number="13">In their presence, I gave Baruch the order,</verse>
				<verse number="14">“ Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says: ‘Take the sealed deed of purchase and its open copy and secure them in a clay pot so that they may be preserved for a long time.’</verse>
				<verse number="15">For Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says: ‘People will once again buy houses, fields, and vineyards in this land.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="16">After I had entrusted the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed:</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Lord Yahweh, you stretched out your mighty arm and created the heavens and the earth by your awesome power. Nothing is impossible with you!</verse>
				<verse number="18">You show your loyal, tender love to thousands and thousands. But you also repay the guilt of fathers upon their children. You are the great and mighty God, whose name is Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You surpass all with your wise counsel and wise planning. Your miracles reveal your mighty power. Your eyes see everything people do, and you repay each one according to what their ways and actions deserve.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You performed signs and wonders in Egypt as you still do in Israel even to this day. Your name is famous yesterday, today, and forever.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Your signs and wonders in Egypt resulted in rescuing your people Israel. You stretched out your mighty hand and bared your omnipotent arm and terrifying power.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then you gave them this land that you had promised their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But when they entered and took possession of it, they would neither listen to your voice nor follow your law. They would do nothing you commanded them to do, so you brought this disaster on them.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Look! The Babylonians have already set up siege ramps to take the city! Jerusalem is now within their clutches. The people will suffer from war, food shortages, and disease when they attack the city. What you prophesied has now come true, as you see.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Yet you, Lord Yahweh, are the one who told me: ‘Buy the field, pay for it, and get witnesses,’ even though the Babylonians are about to capture the city.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Behold, I am Yahweh, God of all the world. Nothing is impossible with me.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Therefore, I say to you, I will hand Jerusalem over to the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar the king, and he will conquer it.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The attacking army of Babylon will seize this city, set it on fire, and burn it to the ground. The people offered sacrifices to Baal on those same rooftops and poured out drink offerings to other idols, provoking my anger.</verse>
				<verse number="30">From their earliest history, the people of Israel and Judah alike have done evil in my presence. In fact, the people of Israel have done nothing but make me angry by their actions, declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="31">From the day they built this city, these people have made me angry and furious. Therefore, I will destroy it</verse>
				<verse number="32">because of all the wickedness of the people of Israel and Judah. They have all provoked my anger, their kings, their officials, their priests, their prophets, the people of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="33">They have turned their backs to me and not their faces. Even though I taught them so untiringly over and over, they would not listen or accept correction.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Instead, they have defiled the house that bears my name by placing their detestable idols inside it.</verse>
				<verse number="35">And in the Valley of Hinnom, they have built shrines to Baal. They have sacrificed their little sons and daughters to Molech in the fire —something I never commanded, nor did it ever enter my thoughts!”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Yahweh, God of Israel, says, “You say that because of war, plague, and food shortages that Jerusalem will fall and be handed over to the king of Babylon, but this is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says:</verse>
				<verse number="37">I will graciously regather the people of Jerusalem although I was previously filled with anger and scattered them in foreign countries by my great indignation. Yes, I will bring them back to this place, and they will live under my protection.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.</verse>
				<verse number="39">I will give them one single purpose and one wonderful way to live so that they will always honor me, for their own good and for the good of their descendants.</verse>
				<verse number="40">I will make an everlasting covenant with them, and I will never stop doing good things for them. I will inspire them to honor and respect me so that they will never walk away from me again.</verse>
				<verse number="41">What delight I will have in doing good things for them! With all my heart and soul, I promise that they will be planted firmly in this land once again.</verse>
				<verse number="42">“For Yahweh promises: Just as I have brought great disaster on the people, I will someday do all these great things for them.</verse>
				<verse number="43">People will again buy fields in this land that you call a wasteland without men or animals. I have given it over to the Babylonians.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Yes, people will pay cash for property, draw up deeds, seal them, and have them witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, throughout the villages around Jerusalem, the towns of Judah, the highlands, the western foothills, and the southern desert. For I will restore what was lost and bring the captives back to their land,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="33">
				<verse number="1">Jeremiah was still confined to the palace guardhouse when the word of Yahweh came to him a second time, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“I, Yahweh, made the earth, formed its contours, and set it in place. Yahweh is my name. I say to you,</verse>
				<verse number="3">cry out to me and I will answer you. I will reveal to you great things, guarded secrets that you never could have known.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For I, Yahweh, God of Israel, have something to say about the houses of this city and the dwellings of the kings of Judah. You have torn them down to be used to defend yourselves against the attack of the Babylonian armies.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The defenders of the city will go out and battle the Babylonians, but this will only serve to fill the ruins with the corpses of men who are the victims of my furious anger. I have hidden my face from this city because of all their evil.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Nevertheless, I will heal them, restore them, and give them prosperity and lasting peace.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will bring back the captives of Israel and Judah and reestablish them as before.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I will cleanse them from all the guilt of all the sins they have committed against me. I will even forgive all their sins of rebellion against me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And it will become to me a source of joy, honor, and splendor for all the earth to see. When they hear of all the prosperity that I bestow upon the people, they will be shaken to the core at all the good and prosperity that I lavish upon it.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“They say about this place, ‘It is a wasteland, without people or animals.’ But this is what I, Yahweh, say to you: In the desolate towns of Judah and in the abandoned streets of Jerusalem without people or animals, you will hear once more</verse>
				<verse number="11">the raucous shouts of joy and mirth and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride. You will once again hear the glad songs sung by those who bring thank offerings to my temple, singing, ‘We give thanks to mighty Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, for he is so good, and he will love you forever!’ “I, Yahweh, promise that I will bring back the country’s captives, as before.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And surrounding all the towns of this uninhabited wasteland without people or animals, there will once again be pastureland for the shepherds to rest their flocks,” says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“In the towns of the highlands, the lowlands, and the southern desert, in the land of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah, flocks will once again pass under the hand of a shepherd who counts them,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yahweh says, “The time is coming when I will fulfill the gracious promise of good things to come that I made to the people of Israel and Judah:</verse>
				<verse number="15">At that time, I will cause a righteous Branch to sprout from David’s lineage. And he will administer justice and righteousness in the land.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Under his rule, Judah will triumph and Jerusalem will live in safety. And the city will be called Yahweh Is Our Righteousness.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yahweh says, “There will always be a descendant of David to be king in Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And there will always be priests from the tribe of Levi to stand before me to offer burnt offerings, grain offering, and daily sacrifices to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="20">“I say to you that I, Yahweh, have a covenant with the day and the night so that they always come at their appointed times. As no one can break the covenant I made with them,</verse>
				<verse number="21">so no one can break the covenant I have made with my servant David and with the priests from the tribe of Levi who serve at my altar. A descendant of David will always rule as king of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Just as no one can count the stars in the sky nor measure the sand of the seashore, so I will increase the descendants of my servant David and the Levites who minister to me until they cannot be counted.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Have you heard that these people are saying, ‘ Yahweh has forsaken Judah and Israel, whom he chose for himself’? They despise my people and no longer consider them as a nation.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I, Yahweh, say to you that I will never break my covenant with the day and the night or let the heavens and the earth stop obeying my commands.</verse>
				<verse number="26">In the same way, I will never reject the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of David my servant. There will always be a descendant of David to rule over his people. For I will show kindness to my people Israel, and they will prosper and be successful again.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="34">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, was at war against Jerusalem and the cities of Judah. He had all his army with him, including soldiers from all the kingdoms of his empire.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh, God of Israel, then told me to go to Zedekiah king of Judah and give him this message: “ Yahweh says to you, ‘I am going to hand over this city to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down.</verse>
				<verse number="3">You will not escape from his clutches but will certainly be captured and given over to him. You will see the king of Babylon face-to-face and speak to him in person. Then you will go into exile to Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So listen now to the promise of Yahweh, Zedekiah king of Judah. I, Yahweh, say that you will not be executed.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You will die in peace, and incense will be burned for you at your funeral as they burned it for the kings before you. They will mourn for you, saying: “How terrible! Our highness is dead! ” I, Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So I repeated all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Meanwhile, the army of Babylon was trying to break through the walls of Lachish and Azekah, the only remaining fortified towns of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah after King Zedekiah had made an agreement with the people of Jerusalem to set free all the Jewish slaves.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, men and women, and no longer enslave a fellow Jew.</verse>
				<verse number="10">All the leaders and all the people made an agreement that everyone should free their slaves, men or women, and no longer keep them enslaved, so they set every slave free.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But afterward, they went back on their word and forced the men and women whom they had set free back into slavery.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="13">“I, Yahweh, God of Israel, made a covenant with your ancestors when I led them out of the house of bondage in Egypt. I said</verse>
				<verse number="14">that every seventh year, each one of you is to free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. They may be your slave for six years, then you must give them their freedom. Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me and would not obey.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You recently decided to obey me and did what pleases me by setting your Hebrew slaves completely free. You even went to the temple dedicated to me, and in my name, you made a covenant to set them free.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But now you have broken your promise and dishonored my name by forcing your former slaves back into slavery. From those whom you once set free to live as they please, you have taken their freedom away again to please yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“So, I, Yahweh, say you have disobeyed me by failing to grant freedom to your fellow Jews. Very well then. I, Yahweh, declare that I will give you freedom—the freedom to die by the sword, disease, and starvation. And I will make you a disgusting sight to every nation in the world.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The officials of Judah and of Jerusalem, together with the palace officials, the priests, and all the leaders, made a covenant with me. And to seal their agreement to set their slaves free, they walked between the two halves of a calf that they had cut in two. But they broke the covenant and did not fulfill its terms. So, I will do to these people what they did to the calf.</verse>
				<verse number="19"></verse>
				<verse number="20">I will hand them over to their enemies, to those determined to kill them. And their dead bodies will be food for the birds and beasts.</verse>
				<verse number="21">These enemies are the king of Babylon and his army. They have stopped attacking Jerusalem for now, but they still want to kill King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials. So, I will command them to return and attack again. This time they will conquer the city and burn it to the ground. I will hand over King Zedekiah and all his officials. I will also turn the towns of Judah into an inhabitable wasteland.”</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="35">
				<verse number="1">When Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, Yahweh spoke to me and said,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Go to the Rechabites and invite them to come with you into one of the side rooms of the temple of Yahweh. When they arrive, offer them a drink of wine.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So I went to see Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah and grandson of Habazziniah, his brothers, and all his sons, and the entire Rechabite clan.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I brought them all to the temple of Yahweh and into the room where the disciples of the prophet Hanan son of Igdaliah stayed. The room was next to that of the temple officials, directly above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum, the keeper of the temple entrance.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine with some cups and said, “Here, have some wine.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">But they replied, “We don’t drink wine because our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab made a rule that we must obey. He insisted that we and our descendants must never drink wine,</verse>
				<verse number="7">build houses for ourselves, or plant crops or vineyards. He told us, ‘You must always live in tents as resident aliens so that you may live long in the land.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">Our clan has always fully obeyed the command of Jonadab son of Rechab, our ancestor. To this very day, we and our wives, sons, and daughters don’t drink wine, build houses, or plant vineyards or crops. And we have lived in tents.</verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">However, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded the land, we decided, ‘ We must protect ourselves! Let’s go to Jerusalem to escape the armies of the Babylonians and the Syrians.’ That is why we are living now in Jerusalem.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Yahweh spoke to me and said,</verse>
				<verse number="13">“I am Yahweh, the God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies. Go and say to the people of Judah and Jerusalem: ‘You must listen to me and receive instruction. Learn a lesson from the Rechabites, declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The words of Jonadab son of Rechab ordered his descendants to drink no wine, and they have fully obeyed their ancestor’s command, for they drank no wine even until today. But I have spoken to you so urgently, over and over, yet you refuse to listen.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I have repeatedly sent my servants the prophets to you, saying, “Repent, every one of you, from your evil actions and correct the way you’ve been living. Do not chase after other gods to serve them, and you will continue to live on the land I gave to you and your ancestors.” But you have not paid attention or listened to me.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The descendants of Jonadab and Rechab have kept the command their ancestor gave them, but your people have not listened to me.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So now, I, Lord Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, say to you people of Judah and Jerusalem: I spoke to you, and you would not listen; because I called to you and you would not answer me, I will bring upon you all the destruction I have decreed against you.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Jeremiah said to the Rechabites, “ Yahweh, the God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says to you, ‘Because you have obeyed the commands of your ancestor Jonadab and observed all his rules, obeying everything he ordered you to do,</verse>
				<verse number="19">therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, promises you this: There will always be a male descendant of Jonadab son of Rechab who will stand before me and serve me forever.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="36">
				<verse number="1">In the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, Yahweh said to me,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Get a scroll and write on it every word that I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations from the first time I spoke to you when Josiah was king up to now.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Perhaps when the people of Judah hear of the totality of destruction that I intend to bring on them, they will turn from their evil ways; then I will forgive their perversity and their sins.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So I summoned Baruch son of Neriah and dictated to him everything that Yahweh had said to me, and Baruch wrote it all down on a scroll.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then, I instructed Baruch: “I am forbidden to go back into the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So during the next day of fasting in the temple, you must go and read aloud from the scroll so that the people will hear everything that Yahweh has said to me and that I have dictated to you. Make sure all the people of Judah who have come in from their towns hear you clearly.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Perhaps they will pray to Yahweh and turn from their evil ways, for Yahweh has promised to punish these people with his terrible anger and fury.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">So Baruch followed my instructions, went into the temple, and read Yahweh ’s words from the scroll.</verse>
				<verse number="9">In the ninth month of the fifth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the people of Judah and Jerusalem were fasting.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then, while all the people were listening in the temple, Baruch publicly read from the scroll everything that I had said. He did this from the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan, the king’s royal scribe. His room was in the upper courtyard near the entrance of the New Gate of the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The moment Micaiah the son of Gemariah heard Yahweh ’s message being read from the scroll,</verse>
				<verse number="12">he went straight to the king’s palace and to the chambers of the king’s royal scribe, where all the government officials were holding a meeting. Those attending were Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other government officials.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Micaiah recounted everything that he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then the officials sent Jehudi (the son of Nethaniah, grandson of Shelemiah and great-grandson of Cushi) to tell Baruch to bring them the scroll that he had read to the people. So Baruch went to them, carrying the scroll in his hand.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Have a seat,” they said, “and please read the scroll to us.” They listened attentively as Baruch read its entirety to them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When they had heard its contents, the officials were seized with panic, and they said to Baruch, “ This is dreadful! We must report this to the king.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then they asked him, “Tell us, how did you write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it to you?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Baruch answered, “Yes he did. I wrote it down word for word in ink on this scroll.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then they said to him, “ For your own safety, you and Jeremiah must go into hiding. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">For safekeeping, the officials put the scroll in the office of Elishama, the court secretary, and went to the king’s court, where they reported everything to the king.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then the king sent Jehudi to retrieve the scroll. He brought it from the room of Elishama and read it to the king and all his gathered officials.</verse>
				<verse number="22">It was winter and the king was sitting in front of the fireplace in his winter palace.</verse>
				<verse number="23">As soon as Jehudi finished reading three or four columns from the scroll, the king would cut them off with a small knife and throw them into the fire until the entire scroll was burned up.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But none of those who heard the contents of the scroll showed the slightest hint of remorse or sorrow, including the king.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Although Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll, he brushed them off and paid no attention to them.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then he commanded Prince Jerahmeel, together with Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to arrest me and my scribe Baruch, but Yahweh had hidden us.</verse>
				<verse number="27">After King Jehoiakim had burned the scroll that I had dictated to Baruch, Yahweh instructed me</verse>
				<verse number="28">to get a new scroll and write everything on it that was in the first scroll.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Yahweh told me to tell the king, “ Yahweh says to you: You have burned the scroll, and you have demanded that Jeremiah tell you why he prophesied that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land and exterminate its people and its animals.</verse>
				<verse number="30">So now, I, Yahweh, say to you, King Jehoiakim of Judah, people will cast your dead body out on the ground, where it will rot and be exposed to the sun by day and the frost by night. And none of your descendants will succeed you on the throne of David.</verse>
				<verse number="31">I will punish all of you, your descendants, and your officials for all your blatant sins. You and the people of Judah and Jerusalem have not stopped to pay attention to any of my warnings. Therefore, I will pour out on all of you every disaster that I have pronounced against you.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then I took another scroll and gave it to Baruch my scribe, and he wrote down everything that I dictated. He wrote everything that had been on the first scroll that Jehoiakim had destroyed. I also dictated to Baruch many similar prophecies, which were added as well.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="37">
				<verse number="1">King Nebuchadnezzar had deported Judah’s King Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim to Babylon. He then installed Josiah’s son Zedekiah as king in his place.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But Zedekiah, his officials, and the people paid no attention to the words Yahweh had spoken through me.</verse>
				<verse number="3">King Zedekiah sent two men to me with a request, Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah. They said to me, “Please intercede to Yahweh our God that he would help us.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">(Now I was still moving about freely among the people, for I had not yet been put in prison.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Meanwhile, Pharaoh and his Egyptian army were on the move. And when the Babylonians who had besieged Jerusalem heard that the Egyptians were on the move against them, they withdrew from the city.)</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then Yahweh, the God of Israel, spoke to me: “This is what you are to say to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, who asked you to consult with me: ‘Pharaoh’s army that you thought was coming to help you is about to return to Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">And the Babylonians will come back and attack this city. They will capture it and burn it down.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I, Yahweh, warn you, do not deceive yourselves into thinking, “The Babylonians won’t come back to attack us,” because they surely will.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For even if you were to defeat the entire army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you and only severely wounded men were left lying in their tents, they still would rise up and burn this city to the ground!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now, the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh’s army.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So I set out from Jerusalem to go to Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin to settle some affairs regarding my share of an inheritance among my people.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But when I arrived at the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard named Irijah, son of Shelemiah, grandson of Hananiah, seized me and accused me of trying to desert to the Babylonians.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“You’re wrong,” I replied. “I’m not a traitor.” But Irijah refused to listen to me. He arrested me and brought me to the officials.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The officials were furious with me, and they beat me and locked me up in the house of Jonathan, the court secretary, which they had made into a prison.</verse>
				<verse number="16">After I had been put into the dungeon for a long time,</verse>
				<verse number="17">King Zedekiah had me secretly brought to his palace. He asked me, “Has Yahweh given you a word for me?” “Yes,” I answered. “ Yahweh is going to let you be captured by the king of Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But please tell me, what crime have I committed against you, your officials, or these people that you have thrown me in prison?</verse>
				<verse number="19">Your ‘prophets’ who told you that the king of Babylonia would not attack you or invade the land, where are they now?</verse>
				<verse number="20">So now, please hear me, my lord the king. Let my humble plea come before you. Do not send me back to the dungeon at the court secretary Jonathan’s house. That would be my certain death!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">So King Zedekiah gave orders to confine me to the palace guardhouse. Each day a loaf of bread from the bakery was given to me until all the bread of the city was gone. So I remained there in the palace courtyard.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="38">
				<verse number="1">The officials of Jerusalem were listening to me as I was prophesying, including Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchiah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I told them: “ Yahweh says that whoever stays in this city will die by sword, plague, or food shortages, but anyone who leaves the city and surrenders to the Babylonians will escape with their lives and live.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For Yahweh has said, ‘ I will certainly hand over Jerusalem to the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then the officials said to the king, “This traitor must die! His words are demoralizing the soldiers and all the people left in the city. This man is not seeking the welfare of the people but their ruin.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">King Zedekiah answered, “He is in your hands, so do what you want, I will not stand in your way.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So they took me and put me into the muddy cistern of the king’s son Malchiah in the palace courtyard. There was little water in the cistern, only mud. They lowered me down with ropes, and I sank down deep into the mud.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, a palace official, heard that I had been put into the cistern. As the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate,</verse>
				<verse number="8">Ebed-Melech came out from the palace and spoke to the king.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“My lord the king,” he said, “these evil men were wrong to throw the prophet Jeremiah into a muddy cistern. He will starve to death there since there is no more food left in the city.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So the king commanded Ebed-Melech, “Take thirty men with you from the palace guard and pull the prophet Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So he went with the men into the palace to a room under the treasury and took some worn-out clothing and rags and lowered them on ropes to me in the cistern.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Ebed-Melech then shouted down to me, “Here, put these worn-out clothes and rags under your armpits to pad the ropes.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So they hauled me up from the cistern and pulled me out, and I remained in confinement in the palace guardhouse.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Later, King Zedekiah summoned me to meet him at his private entrance to the temple of Yahweh. “I want to ask you for a word,” the king said to me, “and keep nothing back from me.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">I answered him, “If I tell you the truth you will put me to death. And if I tell you what you should do, you will not listen to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">King Zedekiah then secretly promised me with an oath, saying, “As surely as Yahweh, the giver of this life of ours, lives, I will neither have you put to death nor hand you over to these men who are determined to kill you.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Well then,” I said to Zedekiah, “ Yahweh, the God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies says, ‘If you go out and surrender to Nebuchadnezzar’s generals, your life will be spared, and Jerusalem will not be burned down. You and your family will survive.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But if you do not surrender to Nebuchadnezzar’s generals, this city will be handed over to the Babylonians, they will burn it down, and I will make sure that you are taken prisoner by your enemies.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="19">King Zedekiah then said to me, “I’m afraid of our own people who have already defected to the Babylonians. They might give me into their hands; then they will torture me!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">“That will not happen,” I told him. “Please listen to Yahweh ’s voice in what I say, and then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yahweh has given me a vision of what will happen to you if you refuse to surrender.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I saw all the women left in the king’s palace being led out and given to the generals of the king of Babylon. And they were all taunting you as they were led away: “ ‘Your trusted friends led you astray and overcame you! They told you to resist, as they all ran away! See, now your feet are stuck in the mire, yes, you’re trapped so deep in the mud.’</verse>
				<verse number="23">“Yes, all your wives and children will be marched out into your enemy’s camp. And you, Zedekiah, will be a prisoner in the clutches of the king of Babylon, powerless to escape. And this city will be burned to the ground.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Zedekiah then said to me, “If you wish to keep on living, tell no one about our conversation.</verse>
				<verse number="25">If my officials hear that I have been talking to you, and they come and ask you, ‘What did you say to the king and what did the king say to you? You’d better tell us everything, or we will kill you,’</verse>
				<verse number="26">then you must reply, ‘I humbly begged the king not to send me back to the prison at Jonathan’s house to die there.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="27">In fact, the officials did come to interrogate me about my meeting with the king, so I told them exactly what he had instructed me to say. Because no one overheard my conversation with the king, they stopped questioning me at that point.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And so, I remained confined in the palace guardhouse until the tragic day Jerusalem was captured.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="39">
				<verse number="1">It was in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign. In the tenth month of that year, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked Jerusalem with his entire army, laying siege to it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">After the city had been surrounded for two years, they broke through the city walls.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When the Babylonians captured Jerusalem, the king’s leading officials took their seats in the Middle Gate to form their military government: Nergal-Sharezer, Samgar-Nebo, Sar-Sechim a high dignitary of state, Nergal-Sharezer the king’s chief adviser, and all the other officials of the king of Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Upon seeing them at the Middle Gate, Zedekiah and all his soldiers tried to escape the city under cover of darkness. They went by way of the king’s garden and slipped through the gate between the two city walls and headed toward the Jordan River Valley.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But the Babylonians pursued them and caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was at the town of Riblah in the territory of Hamath, where he passed sentence on him there.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Nebuchadnezzar had Zedekiah’s sons slaughtered at Riblah and forced him to watch their execution. The king of Babylon also executed all the leading men of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then, he ordered that Zedekiah be bound with chains and have his eyes gouged out. Blinded, King Zedekiah was dragged off to distant Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Meanwhile in Jerusalem, the Babylonians demolished the city walls, and burned down the temple of Yahweh and the king’s royal palace.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Nebuzaradan the field general held captive anyone left behind in Jerusalem and the deserters who had gone over to him and took them all away to distant Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But he left behind some of the extremely poor people in the land of Judah. They owned nothing, so he gave them fields and vineyards to possess as their own.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders to Nebuzaradan, the field general:</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Find Jeremiah, look after him well, and don’t harm him. Do for him whatever he asks.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Nebuzaradan the field general, Nebushazban the chief palace official, and Nergal-Sharezer a high official, along with the other officers of King Nebuchadnezzar,</verse>
				<verse number="14">dispatched some men to bring me from the courtyard of the guardhouse. They entrusted me to the care of Gedaliah son of Ahikam, grandson of Shaphan, and told him to make sure I get home safely. And so, I stayed with the people who remained in Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="15">While I was still confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse, Yahweh spoke to me and said,</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Go and prophesy to Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian and tell him what I, Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies have to say: ‘I am going to do what I promised to do to this city, and it will not be good but disastrous. And you will see it come true before your eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But I will rescue you that day, declares Yahweh, and you will not be handed over to the people you fear.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I will certainly protect you so that no one will kill you. Yes, your life will be your reward because you have put your trust in me, declares Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="40">
				<verse number="1">The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah. I was bound with chains and led away along with all the other people from Jerusalem and Judah that the Babylonians were taking as prisoners to Babylon. When we got to Ramah, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, realized what had happened to me and released me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He took me aside and said to me, “Your God, Yahweh, prophesied disaster for your country,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and now he has brought it to pass. He has done what he threatened to do because your people sinned against Yahweh and would not listen to his voice. So all this has happened to you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Today I release you from your chains. If you would like to come with me to Babylon, then come. I will make sure you are cared for. If you do not want to come to Babylon with me, then stay here. See, you have the whole land before you, so go wherever you think it best.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">However, before I turned to leave, Nebuzaradan added, “Have you thought about staying with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, grandson of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed governor over the towns of Judah? You could stay with him among the people or go anywhere else you think best.” With that, Nebuzaradan gave me a gift and ample provisions for my journey and let me go.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I decided to stay with my people in the land of Judah, so I went to live near Gedaliah in Mizpah.</verse>
				<verse number="7">There were still some Judean forces in the open country. Their captains heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor of Judah and made him responsible for everyone, including the poor, who had not been deported to Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Those who came to Gedaliah at Mizpah included Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah son of the Maacathite, they and their men.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, grandson of Shaphan, reassured them and gave them his word that they need not be afraid to serve the Babylonians. “Stay in the land,” he said. “Serve the king of Babylon, and everything will be fine.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I will stay here at Mizpah and represent you to the Babylonians on their official visits. Meanwhile, you can harvest the wine, the summer crops, and olive oil. Go ahead and store up the harvest and settle in the towns you have taken over.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Many people from Judah had fled to Moab, Ammon, Edom, or other countries. But when they learned that the Babylonian king had allowed the rest of the people in Judah to return and had named Gedaliah governor,</verse>
				<verse number="12">they also returned to Judah from all the places where they had been scattered and reported to Gedaliah in Mizpah. The people harvested large amounts of wine and fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="13">One day Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders still in the field came to Mizpah to meet with Gedaliah.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They said to him, “We came to warn you that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to assassinate you.” But Gedaliah would not believe them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So Johanan went privately and approached Gedaliah, saying, “Please let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know who did it. Why should he assassinate you and scatter all the Israelites who have rallied around you? Why should the remnant of Judah perish?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But Gedaliah replied to Johanan, “This is an order; don’t do it! For what you say about Ishmael is not true.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="41">
				<verse number="1">But in the seventh month of that same year, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and grandson of Elishama, came to Mizpah with ten of his soldiers. He had been one of the king’s officials and was a member of the royal family. Ishmael and his men had a meal together with Gedaliah in Mizpah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then suddenly Ishmael jumped up with his armed men and killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, grandson of Shaphan. They killed Gedaliah, the man whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Ishmael also struck down all the Israelites who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Babylonian soldiers who happened to be there.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The very next day, before anyone knew of it,</verse>
				<verse number="5">eighty men arrived from the towns of Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. They were on their way to the temple to offer gifts of grain and incense to Yahweh. They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and cut themselves because they were mourning.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And Ishmael son of Nethaniah went from Mizpah to meet them at the town gate, pretending to be weeping as he came. He said to them, “Come in to see Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">But after they had entered the gates, Ishmael and the men with him slaughtered them and cast their bodies into a cistern.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He spared ten of the men who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us,” because they offered to give him supplies of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey they had hidden in a field.</verse>
				<verse number="9">(Now he threw all the bodies, including Gedaliah’s, into the large well that had been dug by King Asa of Judah when he was invaded by King Baasha of Israel.)</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Ishmael took captive the king’s daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah. Ishmael took them captive and crossed over the Jordan to join up with the Ammonites.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the army officers with him heard of all the murderous evil that Ishmael had done.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him at the great pool that is in Gibeon.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And when all the captives who were with Ishmael saw Johanan and all the army officers, they rejoiced.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So all Ishmael’s prisoners from Mizpah turned and ran to Johanan and the officers.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But Ishmael escaped from Johanan with eight of his men and went to the Ammonites.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So Johanan and all the army officers with him rescued all of Ishmael’s prisoners from Mizpah—the soldiers, women, children, and royal officials taken captive after Ishmael murdered Gedaliah. Johanan brought them all back alive from Gibeon.</verse>
				<verse number="17">However, they were afraid of the Babylonians because Ishmael had murdered Gedaliah, the king of Babylon’s governor of the land. So, they set out for Egypt in order to avoid the Babylonians. On the way, they stopped at Geruth Chimham, near Bethlehem.</verse>
				<verse number="18"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="42">
				<verse number="1">Then Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, the military leaders, and all the people from the least to the greatest who were with him, approached</verse>
				<verse number="2">me and said, “Please listen to our humble plea and pray to Yahweh your God for us and for all this remnant. We were once many, but as you see, only a few of us remain.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Pray that Yahweh your God may show us where to go and what we must do.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Very well then,” I replied. “I will take your request to Yahweh your God and tell you whatever answer he gives me, and I will keep nothing back from you.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then they in their turn said to me, “May Yahweh be an honest and faithful witness against us if we do not obey what Yahweh your God speaks to us through you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Whether we like it or not, we will obey Yahweh our God to whom we have asked you to pray. We know that all will go well with us if we obey the voice of Yahweh our God.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Ten days later, Yahweh gave me his answer.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So I called together Johanan, the military leaders, and all the people who were with him without distinction</verse>
				<verse number="9">and said, “ Yahweh, God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition, says this:</verse>
				<verse number="10">‘If you will remain in this land, I will build you up and not pull you down; I will firmly plant you and not uproot you. For I am filled with sorrow because of the disaster I had to bring upon you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Stop being afraid of the king of Babylon. Your fears are for nothing, for I am with you to save you and rescue you from his clutches,’ declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="12">‘I will show you mercy, so that he has mercy toward you and will restore you to your land.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But you must obey Yahweh your God and remain in this land.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“ Do not think for a moment: ‘We must go live in Egypt, where we will see no warfare nor be hungry nor hear the sound of the trumpet.’</verse>
				<verse number="15">If you do, remnant of Judah, then listen to what Yahweh, the God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies says to you: ‘If you are determined to go to Egypt and settle there, then this is what will happen.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The sword you fear will overtake you, and the famine you dread will follow you to Egypt, and there you will die.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Everyone who is determined to run to Egypt and settle there will die by sword, plague, and food shortages. Not one of you will survive the disasters I will send.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Yes, I, Yahweh, the God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, say to you: Just as my furious anger was poured out on the people of Jerusalem, so will my fury be poured out on you if you go to Egypt. You will be something that people will curse, and people will use your name when they pronounce a curse. You will be a horrifying sight, and people will make fun of you, and you will never see this place again.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then I said to the remnant of Judah, “ Yahweh has told you, ‘Do not go into Egypt.’ So now, you should know very clearly that I am warning you</verse>
				<verse number="20">that you are in danger of your very lives. You deceived me when you sent me to Yahweh your God and said, ‘Pray for us to Yahweh our God; whatever he says, we will do it.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">Today I have told you exactly what he said, but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything he sent me to tell you.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So understand this clearly: you will die by sword, plague, and food shortages in Egypt, where you are determined to go.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="43">
				<verse number="1">Jeremiah finished telling the crowd what the Lord had commanded him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and other arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are lying. Yahweh our God did not tell you to say to us, ‘Do not go live in Egypt.’</verse>
				<verse number="3">It was Baruch son of Neriah who stirred you up against us to hand us over to the Babylonians to be either killed or deported to Babylon.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Johanan, all the army officers, and all the people refused to obey Yahweh ’s command to stay in Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Instead, Johanan and his military leaders gathered up everyone left in Judah who had come back from all the nations where they had been scattered.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They also led off the men, women, children, and the king’s daughters, too, and every single person that Nebuzaradan the field general had left under the charge of Gedaliah son of Ahikam. This included the prophet Jeremiah and Baruch son of Neriah.</verse>
				<verse number="7">In total disobedience to the voice of Yahweh, they entered the land of Egypt and arrived at Tahpanhes.</verse>
				<verse number="8">At Tahpanhes, Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah and said,</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Take some large stones to the entrance of Pharaoh’s royal building in Tahpanhes. Bury the stones underneath the clay pavement and make sure the people of Judah are watching.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then say to them, ‘ Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. He will set up his throne on the exact spot where I buried these stones and spread his royal tent over them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When he comes to invade, he will defeat Egypt: “ ‘Those destined for the plague will die by the plague; those destined for captivity will go into captivity; those destined for the sword will die by the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“ ‘He will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt and burn up their gods or take them prisoner. He will fold up the land of Egypt as a shepherd folds his cloak over himself. Then he will leave victorious without anyone standing in his way.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He will break the obelisks of the temple of the sun in Egypt and will burn to the ground the temples of the gods of Egypt.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="44">
				<verse number="1">Here is the word Yahweh gave Jeremiah concerning all the Israelites who were living in Egypt. They were in the cities of Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis, and in the Pathros region.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“ Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says this: You have seen with your own eyes all the disaster I have brought upon Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah. Look at them; now they are in ruins and left uninhabited.</verse>
				<verse number="3">This disaster came to your people because of their evil deeds; they have worshiped foreign gods, which they have previously known nothing about nor have their ancestors. They have brought them offerings and provoked my anger.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yet I kept sending you my servants the prophets to plead with you to stop doing such detestable things, which I hate with a passion!</verse>
				<verse number="5">But you would not listen or pay attention, in order to turn from your wickedness and stop offering incense to other gods.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So I let loose a firestorm of my anger, burning down the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem until nothing remained but a desolate wasteland, as it still is today.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“And now I, Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander God of Angel Armies, ask you: Why do you insist on heading for another disaster, one that will destroy every man, woman, and child in Judah? Why should you leave yourselves without a remnant?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Why do you keep provoking my wrath by offering incense to Egyptian gods where you have settled? Are you bent on your own destruction? Don’t you realize you will become a curse and a laughingstock for all the nations of the earth?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Have you forgotten all you have done in Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your ancestors, your wives, your kings, and their wives?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Even now, you refuse to humble yourselves or be in awe of me. You have not followed my law or my teachings, which I set before you and your ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“So, I, Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, say to you that I am determined to bring disasters upon the people of Judah living in Egypt to eliminate you completely.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will make sure that the remnant of Judah who were determined to live in Egypt will die in Egypt. You will all be killed by the sword or die of starvation, from least to greatest. You will die such horrible deaths in war or from starvation that people of other nations will use you as an object of horror, a curse word, and mockery.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I will punish those who settled in Egypt just as I punished Jerusalem: by sword, starvation, and plague.</verse>
				<verse number="14">None of the remnant of Judah who have settled in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the country of Judah. Even though they want to go and live there again, only a few will escape and return.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then all the women there, along with all the men who were aware that their wives were sacrificing to other gods, answered me. There was a great crowd of people there listening to me, a large group of the people of Judah who lived in southern Egypt and were meeting together. They all answered me, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="16">“You claim to speak to us on behalf of Yahweh, but we refuse to listen to you whatsoever!</verse>
				<verse number="17">We will keep our vows to continue offering incense to our goddess, the Queen of Heaven, and pouring out drink offerings in her honor as we used to do. We will worship her in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem just as we, our ancestors, kings, and officers did in the past. We had plenty of food then, we prospered, and we suffered no disasters.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But since we ceased offering incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have been destitute, and our people have died either by sword or by starvation.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And besides,” the women added, “when we offer incense to the Queen of Heaven, pour out drink offerings to her, and make cakes bearing her image, do you really think we do this without our husbands’ knowledge?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then I replied to all the men and women who had made their statement,</verse>
				<verse number="21">“You and your ancestors, your kings and your leaders, and the people of the land offered sacrifices in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. But Yahweh knew about this and did not forget.</verse>
				<verse number="22">He could not endure your wicked and disgusting practices any longer. He placed a curse on your land and turned it into a desert without inhabitants as it is today.</verse>
				<verse number="23">This disaster has plainly overtaken you because you sinned and offered incense to other gods, refusing to listen to the voice of Yahweh or follow his law, his teachings, and his commandments.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then I said to the men and their wives, “Listen to the word of Yahweh, all you people of Judah living in Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says to you, ‘Both you and your wives have said that you will fulfill the vows you made to give offerings to the Queen of Heaven and pour out drink offerings to her. You have said it, and you have done it. Very well, by all means, keep your promise and fulfill the vows you made!’</verse>
				<verse number="26">But listen to the word of Yahweh, all you people of Judah living in Egypt: ‘I swear by my mighty name, never again will I let any of you profane my name to make a vow by saying, “I swear by the living Lord Yahweh!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Behold, instead of watching over you for good, I will watch for chances to harm you. Some of you will die in war, and others will die by famine until you are wiped out.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Only a very few will escape the sword and will return to the land of Judah from Egypt. Then all the remnant of Judah who came to settle in Egypt will know whose word comes true, mine or theirs.</verse>
				<verse number="29">“ ‘And here is the sign for you,’ Yahweh declares, ‘that I will keep my threats and I will punish you here:</verse>
				<verse number="30">Behold, I will hand over Egypt’s Pharaoh Hophra to his enemies who seek his life just as I handed over Zedekiah king of Judah to his enemy Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was determined to kill him.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="45">
				<verse number="1">In the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, Yahweh gave me a word for Baruch son of Neriah while I was dictating to Baruch the message that he wrote down in a scroll.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I said to him, “Baruch, this is what Yahweh God of Israel says about you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">‘You have been thinking: “These are horrible times for me. In addition to my pain, now Yahweh adds sorrow to my troubles. I am worn out with groaning, with relief nowhere in sight!” ’</verse>
				<verse number="4">But here is a message for you. Yahweh says to you: ‘That which I have built I am about to knock down, and what I have planted I will uproot over the entire land.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Are you seeking personal greatness for yourself? Do not seek it, for I am now going to bring disaster on all humanity, but I will ensure that you escape with your life wherever you may go,’ declares Yahweh.”</verse>

				<verse number="1">The words of Yahweh spoken through the prophet Jeremiah against the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="2">This is a prophecy against the army of Pharaoh Neco of Egypt at Carchemish on the river Euphrates. King Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians defeated the Egyptians in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Egypt’s commanders shout: “Shields up, both large and small! Onward to battle!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Horsemen, harness the horses and mount up! Prepare for battle and put on your helmets! Put on your armor and sharpen your spears!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But Yahweh asks, “What do I see? The army breaking ranks and retreating? Their heroes flee for their lives, beaten, defeated, and terrified, not once looking back.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Don’t let the swift ones get away. Stop the warriors from fleeing! In the north near the Euphrates River, they collapse, slain in battle.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Who is this that rises like the Nile, like a river in flood stage?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Why, it’s Egypt that rose like the Nile, like a river in flood stage. It is prideful Pharaoh who says, ‘I will rise and cover the earth. I will destroy cities and the people who live in them.’</verse>
				<verse number="9">Go ahead, Egypt, tell your horsemen—‘Charge!’ And your chariots—‘Ride forth!’ March out your mighty warriors, your hired soldiers from Ethiopia and Libya with shield in hand, your archers from Lydia skilled with the bow.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For this is the day of Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, a day when he takes vengeance on his foes. The sword will devour until gorged, until drunk on their blood. For Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, is hosting a sacrificial feast in the land of the north, by the river Euphrates.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Go ahead —try to find some healing medicine in Gilead, you frail, unfortunate people of Egypt! None of your medicine will do you any good.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The nations have heard of your humiliation; all the world has heard your scream. For your warriors stumble over each other. No one escapes with his life.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">This is the message Yahweh spoke to the prophet Jeremiah about Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advancing to strike Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Tell this throughout Egypt; proclaim it in the cities of Migdol, Memphis, and Tahpanhes. Say to them, ‘Stand your ground, grab your weapons, for the war will destroy everything around you.’</verse>
				<verse number="15">Why has your mighty god Apis fled? Why did your bull-idol topple over? Yahweh, the true God, has overthrown him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yahweh made many stumble and fall. Falling over each other, they say, ‘Get up! Go back to our own people, to our homeland, and get away from our enemies’ devastating sword!’</verse>
				<verse number="17">They have given a nickname to Pharaoh, king of Egypt— ‘The Loudmouth Who Missed His Opportunity!’</verse>
				<verse number="18">“As surely as I am the King, the Living God, whose name is Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, I declare that there is one coming who will tower over you like Mount Tabor towers over the hills, and like Mount Carmel stands high above the sea.</verse>

				<verse number="20">Egypt was a lovely, splendid heifer, but a stinging fly from the north has settled on her.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The mercenaries she had with her were like pampered, fattened calves, but they, too, turned and ran away; they failed to stand and fight. For the day has come when Yahweh will bring disaster and punishment to them.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Egypt hisses like a snake crawling away, as her enemies advance in force and attack her with axes like woodsmen chopping down trees.</verse>
				<verse number="23">They shall cut down her impenetrable forest,” declares Yahweh, “because they are more numerous than locusts; they are without number.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Fair Egypt will be put to shame. I will give her over to the power of a nation from the north.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says: “Behold, I will punish Amon, the god of the Egyptians in the city of Thebes. Yes, I will punish Egypt, her gods, her rulers, Pharaoh, and those who put their trust in him.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I will hand them over to those who seek their lives, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his commanders. But afterward, Egypt will be inhabited again as in the past,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Do not yield to fear, my servant Jacob. Israel, do not be alarmed. For I will rescue you and your descendants from that foreign land in which you are held captive. You will return and live in peace, safe and secure, with no one to make you afraid.”</verse>

Someday, I will bring destruction to all the nations where I have driven you, but I will not destroy you. Let me assure you, I will discipline you but in moderation. I will not allow you to go entirely unpunished.”</verse>

				<verse number="7">Moab, you put your faith in your works and your wealth. That is why you, too, will be conquered. Your god Chemosh will go into captivity, along with his priests and officials.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The destroyer will attack every city; not one will escape. This enemy will ruin both the valleys and the plains, just as Yahweh has said.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Give Moab wings so she can fly away. Her cities will be empty and desolate with no one living in them.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Cursed be the one who does the work of Yahweh halfheartedly, and cursed be the one who withholds his sword from blood.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Moab has always lived securely and has never been taken into exile. Moab is like wine left to settle undisturbed, and never poured from jar to jar. It still has a good flavor, and its taste has never changed.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">But Yahweh declares, “The days are coming when I will send enemies who will pour her out like wine. They will empty her wine jar and smash it to pieces.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Moab will be ashamed of their god Chemosh just as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, the god who was once their confidence.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“How, then, can you say, ‘We are heroes of Moab and mighty men of war’?</verse>
				<verse number="15">The destroyer has attacked the cities and destroyed Moab, and the best of her young men have gone down to the slaughter,” declares King Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“The fall of Moab is at hand, and soon she will be destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Grieve for her, all you neighboring countries and all you who know her fame. How shattered is its rule, that mighty rod, that splendid scepter!</verse>
				<verse number="18">You who live in Fair Dibon, come down from your prideful place and sit in the dust. For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you and has destroyed your fortresses.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You who live in Aroer, stand at the side of the road and wait. Ask the fleeing men and women: ‘What has happened?’</verse>
				<verse number="20">They answer, ‘Moab is humiliated. Weep and cry for Moab, for she has been defeated!’ Announce the news beside the Arnon River: ‘Moab is devastated.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">“ Yahweh has judged the cities of the plateau and has punished them. Those cities include Holon, Jahzah, Mephaath,</verse>
				<verse number="22">Dibon, Nebo, Beth Diblathaim,</verse>
				<verse number="23">Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul, Beth Meon,</verse>
				<verse number="24">Kerioth, and Bozrah. He has punished all the cities of Moab, far and near.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Yahweh declares: “All the strength of Moab is cut off, and her power is broken.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">“Make Moab drink from this cup until drunk because she exalted herself against Yahweh. Drunken Moab will wallow in her own vomit until she makes the world laugh at her.</verse>
				<verse number="27">And they will say, ‘Didn’t you make fun of Israel in the past? Didn’t you say Israel was nothing but crooks? Whenever you spoke of her, didn’t you shake your head in disgust?’</verse>
				<verse number="28">“People of Moab, flee your cities and hide in the rocks. Be like doves that make their nests among the cliffs.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Everyone knows about the pride of Moab. I have heard about how very proud, arrogant, and lofty she is. How highly she thinks of herself!</verse>
				<verse number="30">But I, Yahweh, know of her insolent defiance. Her boasts are empty and accomplish nothing.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Therefore I wail for Moab; I cry out for the whole country, and I mourn for the people of Kir Hareseth.</verse>
				<verse number="32">I will weep for you more than I wept for Jazer, O vine of Sibmah! Your branches passed over the Dead Sea and spread to the sea of Jazer. An enemy has destroyed your figs and your grapes.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“The people no longer experience joy and gladness in the fruitful land of Moab; for I have stopped the people from making wine. They are no longer shouting happily as they tread the grapes, for no wine is coming out of the wine presses. People are indeed shouting but not for joy.</verse>
				<verse number="34">“The loud cries of Heshbon are heard as far as Elealeh and Jahaz. Cries from Zoar are heard in Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah. The brook of Nimrim has dried up.</verse>
				<verse number="35">I will eliminate Moab’s idolaters, those who offer sacrifices in the high place and make offerings to their god,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Therefore, my heart sobs for Moab like a mournful flute. My heart moans as a sad funeral song played on a flute for the people of Kir Hareseth. All the wealth they accumulated has disappeared.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Every head is shaved, and every beard is cut off as a sign of mourning. And around the waist is sackcloth, on all the hands are gashes.</verse>
				<verse number="38">“On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets, people are mourning because I have broken Moab like a discarded vessel for which no one cares,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="39">How it is broken! How they wail! How Moab has turned her back in disgrace! All the surrounding nations find Moab a laughingstock and a thing of horror.</verse>
				<verse number="40">For Yahweh says: “Look, an enemy will swoop down and attack Moab with no warning, like an eagle diving from the sky.</verse>
				<verse number="41">The enemy will capture the cities and the fortresses of Kerioth. On that day, Moab’s warriors will be as frightened as a woman in her birth pains.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Moab will be destroyed, wiped from the earth, because she exalted herself against Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">For Yahweh declares, “Terror, pit, and a snare are waiting for you, people of Moab!</verse>
				<verse number="44">The one who flees from the terror will fall into the pit, and the one who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the snare.” For Yahweh declares, “I will bring upon Moab the year of her punishment.</verse>
				<verse number="45">In Heshbon’s shelter, exhausted refugees are helpless, for fire came out from Heshbon, a flame from the house of Sihon. It has burned everything from the frontiers to the mountain heights of those war-loving people, the Moabites.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Woe to you, O Moab! The people who worshiped Chemosh are gone, for your sons have been taken captive and your daughters into exile.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Yet in the days to come, I will bring Moab’s captives home,” declares Yahweh. This ends Jeremiah’s prophecy concerning Moab.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="49">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh says to the Ammonites: “Has Israel no sons? Is there no one to inherit her land? What right did your god Molech have to take the territory of Gad, and the people of Molech to occupy its towns?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Therefore, I say to you, The days are coming when I will cause the Ammonites of Rabbah to hear the battle cries of their attackers. I will turn her into a heap of ruins and her surrounding villages will be set on fire. Then Israel will drive out those who drove her out. I, Yahweh, affirm it!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Weep and wail, Heshbon, for Ai has been destroyed! Shriek, women of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth and mourn; run back and forth in confusion! For enemies will lead Molech away and take him captive with all his priests and servants.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Why do you glory in your ebbing strength, you rebellious ones? For you trust in your great wealth and say, ‘Who will dare to attack me?’</verse>
				<verse number="5">Look, I will bring terror upon you,” says Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. “Terror will come from every side; everyone will run away, and no one will be there to bring them back together.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But I affirm to you, I will one day bring back the captive Ammonites.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says to Edom: “Is there no wise person left in Teman? Have all the advisers run out of common sense? Has all their wisdom vanished?</verse>
				<verse number="8">People of Dedan, turn and run! Go into hiding, for I will bring ruin on Esau when my time to punish him has come.</verse>
				<verse number="9">People who harvest grapes always leave some for the poor. Thieves who break in at night only take what they want.</verse>
				<verse number="10">However, I have taken everything from Esau’s descendants. I have uncovered his hiding places so that he can hide no longer. All the Edomites are ruined, along with their relatives and neighbors, with no one left to say,</verse>
				<verse number="11">‘Leave your orphans, I’ll take care of them; let your widows depend on me!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="12">For Yahweh says, “Even those nations that don’t deserve to be punished must drink from the cup filled with my anger. So how do you hope to escape? You will not go unpunished but will certainly have to drink from that same cup.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For I have sworn by my great name, Yahweh, that your capital city of Bozrah and all its surrounding villages will become nothing but desert ruins. Bozrah will be a laughingstock, a curse, and an object of horror forever.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">I have received a word from Yahweh. A messenger has been sent to tell the nations: “Assemble your armies for battle and get ready to attack Edom.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Behold, I will make you the least of nations; all the world will despise you.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Your proud heart has deceived you. Your pride rests in thinking everyone is afraid of you.

				<verse number="17">“I will make Edom an object of horror and astonishment; everyone who passes by it will be appalled and will make insulting remarks because of all its disasters!</verse>

				<verse number="21">The earth will shudder at the sound of their downfall while the echoes of their cry reach to the Red Sea.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Look, an enemy will swoop down on Bozrah and attack Edom without warning, like an eagle diving from the sky. The enemy will capture the cities and the fortresses. And on that day Edom’s warriors will be as frightened as a woman in her birth pains.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Yahweh says to Damascus: “ Your neighboring cities of Hamath and Arpad are humiliated, for they have heard the bad news. They are shaken with anxiety like the troubled sea that cannot be calmed.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The people of Damascus are in a panic. They have lost their courage and have turned to run. Anguish and travail have taken hold of them, like a woman in labor.</verse>
				<verse number="25">You were once famous, and I was pleased with you, but now I warn you, ‘Escape while you can!’</verse>
				<verse number="26">Nevertheless, I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, say to you: On that day, the enemy will kill your young men in the streets, and all your warriors will perish.</verse>

			<chapter number="50">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me this prophecy against mighty Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Tell the nations the news; proclaim it everywhere. Publicize it far and wide; make no secret of it, and declare: ‘Babylon has fallen! Her god Marduk is greatly humiliated, and his power is broken. Her idols are disgraced; her filthy images are shattered.’</verse>
				<verse number="3">For a nation is attacking Babylon from the north that will reduce her nation to a desert. People and animals will flee, and no one will inhabit it.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yahweh says: “When that day comes the people of Israel and the people of Judah will go out together with tears streaming down their cheeks to seek Yahweh their God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They will ask the way to Zion and turn their faces toward her, saying to one another, ‘Come, let us bind our hearts to Yahweh in an eternal covenant, which we will never break.’</verse>
				<verse number="6">“My people are like lost sheep; their shepherds led them astray. They are lost, wandering about in the mountains. They went from mountain to hill, forgetting their resting place.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Whoever came across them took advantage of them. Their enemies said, ‘We are not to blame, for they have sinned against Yahweh, the True Home of Justice, against Yahweh, the Living Hope of their ancestors.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">“ My people, flee Babylon and run from the land of the Chaldeans. Be the first ones to leave!</verse>
				<verse number="9">For listen, I am stirring up trouble out of the north against Babylon, and raising up a coalition of mighty nations to attack her. They will take up battle positions against her and conquer her. Their arrows are like a skilled soldier who kills and never returns empty-handed.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I, Yahweh, declare that Chaldea will be plundered, and all who plunder her will be satisfied.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">“ I, Yahweh, say to the people of Babylon: You rejoiced when you robbed my people, my inheritance. You had a good time, making more noise than horses neighing and frolicking like playful heifers at the time of the threshing of grain.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But your motherland is covered with shame, and the city that nurtured you like a mother is totally disgraced. Now, she is the least of nations, nothing but a desert, a parched wasteland.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Because of Yahweh ’s anger, Babylon will become desolate and uninhabited forever. Everyone who passes by will be shocked to see what has happened and will hiss out their scorn.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Archers! Take your positions against Babylon and surround her. Shoot at her! Empty your quiver, for she has sinned against Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Raise the war cry against her from all sides. She surrenders! The attackers have broken down her fortifications and walls. This is Yahweh ’s vengeance! Take revenge on her. Do to them what they did to others.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Uproot from Babylon those who plant fields and harvest crops. They have all fled from the attacking army and returned to their homelands.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Israel was like straying lambs, driven away and scattered by lions. “First, the king of Assyria devoured them, and now, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has gnawed their bones.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So I, Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, say this: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation as I punished the king of Assyria.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“I will bring Israel back to her own land. The people will be like sheep eating their fill on Mount Carmel, in Bashan, in the hill country of Ephraim, and in Gilead. They will all be satisfied.</verse>
				<verse number="20">I, Yahweh, declare that at that time, you may look for Israel’s guilt, but it will disappear, you may search for Judah’s sins, but you will not find them, for I will forgive the remnant whose lives I have spared.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yahweh says: “Now, carry out my instructions to the letter. Attack the land of Merathaim and those who live in Pekod! Kill them and destroy everything they leave behind.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For the noise of battle fills the land, and already great destruction is taking place.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Babylon, you hammered the whole world to pieces, but now your hammer is broken and shattered to pieces. Now you are an object of horror to the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="24">You defied me and fought against me, Babylon, so I laid a trap for you. You were caught before you knew it!</verse>
				<verse number="25">I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, had a work to do in Babylon, So, I opened my armory and brought out the mighty weapons of my wrath.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Attack it from every side! Open her granaries. Pile her up like heaps of grain; curse her with destruction until nothing is left of her.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Slaughter all her warriors; lead them away as cattle to be slaughtered. Woe to them, for their day of reckoning has come, their time for being punished is here.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Listen! Fugitives and refugees from the country of Babylon arrive in Zion, proclaiming on Mount Zion how Yahweh our God has punished the Babylonians for destroying his temple!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Assemble the archers and attack Babylon! Encamp around her and leave no way of escape. Treat her as she has treated others and repay her for all she has done, for she was arrogant and defiant to Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="30">“I, Yahweh, say to you: On that day, your young men will fall in the streets, and all your warriors will perish.</verse>
				<verse number="31">I am against you, O arrogant one! I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, decree: Your day of reckoning has now come, the time for me to punish you is here.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Your proud, arrogant city will stumble and fall with no one to lift her up. I will set the cities of Babylon on fire, and everything around you will go up in flames.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says: “My people, Israel and Judah, are oppressed, You hold them fast and will not let them go.</verse>
				<verse number="34">But their Redeemer is powerful! My name is Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. I will take up their cause and rescue them. I will give the nation rest but make the people of Babylon tremble.</verse>
				<verse number="35">“I, Yahweh, have decreed war against the Chaldeans, against the people of Babylon, and against her mighty rulers and advisers.</verse>
				<verse number="36">I have decreed war against her false prophets. May they lose their wits! I have decreed war against her warriors; let them panic.</verse>
				<verse number="37">War against her horses, her chariots, and the foreign troops among them! Their mighty warriors will become frightened like ordinary citizens. May the war result in all their treasure being plundered!</verse>
				<verse number="38">May a drought dry up all their rivers! For it is a country full of idols, and their terrors make them delirious.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Demons and dark spirits dwell in Babylon, and ostriches make their home there. For all generations, no one will live there again.</verse>
				<verse number="40">As Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns were destroyed and left uninhabited, not one person will ever settle in Babylon again, for I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="41">“Look! They’re coming! Warriors approach from the north. From the remote parts of the earth, great nations and mighty kings are preparing for war.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Armed with bows and scimitars, they are merciless and without compassion. The sound of their armies riding their horses is like the roaring sea. The cavalry is in battle formation and ready to attack you, Fair Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="43">The king of Babylon heard the news, and his strength melted away. Anguish seized him, like the pain of a woman in labor.</verse>
				<verse number="44">“Behold, like a lion suddenly comes out of the jungle of the Jordan to a rich pastureland, I will suddenly make the people of Babylon run away, and I will appoint a leader that I choose. For who can be compared to me? Who is able to challenge me? Name the ruler who can stand up to me.</verse>
				<verse number="45">So now, listen to the plans that I have against you, Babylon. Listen to what I have in store for the land of the Chaldeans. Like little lambs, your children will be dragged away before your own eyes, and everyone will be horrified!</verse>

			<chapter number="51">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh says, “I will stir up the spirit of a destroyer to fight against Babylon and the heart of my enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I will bring foreigners against Babylon to winnow her and plunder her country. They will attack her on every side in the day of her disaster.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Shoot down all their archers and all their proud warriors dressed in armor. Do not spare her soldiers! Destroy her entire army!</verse>
				<verse number="4">The slaughtered will fall throughout the land of the Chaldeans. They will be wounded and die in their city streets.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Remember, your God, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has not forsaken Israel and Judah even though the land is awash with their sins against me, the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Flee from Babylon! Save your lives! Don’t you perish when I punish her for her guilt; the time of revenge is here. Now Yahweh will pay her back for what she has done.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Babylon was like a golden cup in Yahweh ’s hand; she made the whole world drunk. The nations drank her wine and then went mad.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Suddenly the cup of Babylon falls to the ground and is shattered. Wail for her! Get medicine for her wounds; perhaps she can be cured.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They said, ‘We tried to heal Babylon but failed. She can’t be healed, so let’s each go to our own country. For her judgment has reached up to heaven and rises to the very clouds.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yahweh has judged in our favor. Come, let us tell the news in Zion, all the wonders that Yahweh our God has done!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh has stirred up a spirit of hostility in the king of the Medes because Yahweh ’s plan is to destroy Babylon. This is Yahweh ’s revenge for destroying his temple. “Sharpen the arrows; fill up your quivers!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Give the signal to attack Babylon’s walls! Post sentries and reinforce the guards! Prepare a surprise attack! Yahweh has done what he said he would do to the people of Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You who are enthroned beside many rivers and canals and are rich in treasures, your end has come. The thread of your life is cut.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For I have sworn by my great name, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, that I will fill your land with warriors as a swarm of locusts, and they will raise up the victory shout over you.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh made the earth by his glorious power and firmly established it by his great wisdom. His skill stretched out the sky.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When he speaks, a roar is released in the waters of heaven. Clouds rise from the far-off horizons. He unleashes on the earth from his storehouses, rain, lightning bolts, and stormy winds.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Idolaters are senseless and know so little. Idol-makers are shamed by what they make since their idols are nothing but lifeless lies.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They are worthless—nothing but a joke! When Yahweh comes to punish them, they will perish.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yahweh, the Riches of Jacob, you are nothing like these. He created the universe and has chosen Israel to be his inheritance. Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, is his name!</verse>
				<verse number="20">“You were my war club, my battle club. I used you to crush nations and overthrow kingdoms.</verse>
				<verse number="21">With you I defeated horses and riders, and with you I broke chariots and their riders in pieces.</verse>
				<verse number="22">With you I shattered men and women, with you I conquered old and young, and with you I triumphed over young men and girls.</verse>
				<verse number="23">With you I overpowered shepherds and flocks, with you I devastated plowmen and animals that pull the plow, and with you I crushed governors and officials.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">“But now,” Yahweh says, “you will see with your own eyes how I repay you, Babylon and the Chaldeans, for all the wrongs you have done to Zion.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I have become your enemy,” says Yahweh, “O mountain of destruction, destroyer of the whole world! I will unleash my power against you, send you tumbling to the ground, and turn you into a mountain of soot and ashes.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I, Yahweh, declare: After I am through with you, people will not be able to find any among you to rebuild you, not one foundation stone or cornerstone. You will lie desolate forever.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Raise up a signal flag throughout the world; sound the war trumpet among the nations! Prepare the nations to attack her! Assemble the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, Ashkenaz to make war against her. Appoint a commanding officer to lead her enemies in battle; send multitudes of horsemen like swarms of locusts.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Prepare the kings of Media, her governors, all her officials, and all the lands they rule to come make war against Babylon.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then, when Yahweh executed his plan against Babylon, the earth trembled and convulsed. He determined to make Babylon an uninhabited desert.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Babylon’s warriors had enough of fighting, so they stayed inside their forts. With their courage melted away, they have been left like ordinary civilians. Their city gates have been broken through, and her houses are on fire.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Courier after courier, messenger after messenger, runs to inform the king of Babylon: One says, “Your city has been taken from every side.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Another says, “The river crossings have been overrun.” And another, “The thickets and reed marshes have all been burned.” And yet another one says, “All your fighting men are gripped with panic.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">For Yahweh, the God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, says to you: “When people trample down the threshing place, the time of threshing is not far off. The time to harvest Fair Babylon is almost here!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, devoured us, chewed us up, and consumed us like a hungry man consumes a meal. Like a monster he swallowed us whole, filled his belly with our delicacies and then expelled us.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Let the people of Zion say, “May the violence done to our people fall upon Babylon!” Let Jerusalem say, “May the Chaldeans pay for the crime of shedding my blood!”</verse>
				<verse number="36">This is what Yahweh says: “Look, I am taking up your cause to make sure you are avenged. I will dry up her water source and make her rivers run dry.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Babylon will be reduced to a pile of ruins, the haunt of jackals, a thing of horror and scorn, a place where no one lives.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Like lions, the Babylonians all roar over their prey; they growl like lions’ cubs.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Are they ready to feast? I will prepare them a drink that will make them drunk. They will drink themselves tipsy and fall into an everlasting sleep,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="40">“I will lead these proud lions down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams and goats to be sacrificed.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">“What! Has the great city of Babylon been taken? Has the pride of the whole world been seized? Babylon has become an object of horror throughout the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="42">The sea has risen over Babylon; she sinks beneath its crashing waves.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Her nearby towns have become desolate, a parched land, a desert where no one lives and where nobody goes.</verse>
				<verse number="44">I will punish Bel, the god of Babylon, and make him give back what he has stolen. The people will no longer stream to him to bring him their offering. The walls of Babylon have fallen.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">“Leave Babylon behind, my people. Each of you, save your lives from Yahweh ’s furious anger.</verse>
				<verse number="46">But make sure that you are not discouraged. Do not worry about the many conspiracy theories that are being circulated throughout the country. For every year a different rumor spreads— rumors of violence, rumors of one king fighting another.</verse>
				<verse number="47">“Behold, the days are coming when I will punish Babylon’s ‘gods.’ Her entire country will be humiliated, with all her slaughtered lying in the streets.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Creation itself will sing for joy over Babylon’s demise. Destroyers from the north will attack her,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="49">“For people throughout the world have been slain by Babylon. And now, because of Israel’s slaughtered ones, Babylon will fall.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">“You who have escaped with your life, do not wait to leave Babylon behind. Remember Yahweh your God in a distant land, and let your thoughts turn to beautiful Jerusalem.”</verse>
				<verse number="51">“We were mocked and ashamed; we were covered with disgrace because foreigners had entered the temple of Yahweh ’s holy places.”</verse>
				<verse number="52">Yahweh declares, “Behold, the days are coming when I will punish Babylon’s ‘gods,’ and throughout the land, wounded people will be groaning in pain.</verse>
				<verse number="53">I, Yahweh, say, even if Babylon should climb up to the sky, and entrench herself in an inaccessible height, I would still call her enemies to destroy her.”</verse>
				<verse number="54">“Listen! The voice of a shout from Babylon. It is a noise of great destruction coming from the country of the Chaldeans.</verse>
				<verse number="55">I am attacking Babylon and will destroy her and will silence the noise of the city. The enemy armies rush in like roaring waves and attack with shouts and battle cries.</verse>
				<verse number="56">An enemy has come to destroy Babylon. They have captured Babylon’s soldiers and broken their bows into pieces. For Yahweh is a God of recompense; he never fails to repay.</verse>
				<verse number="57">I will make her soldiers and all her leaders drunk, including the advisers, officials, and military commanders. They will fall into an everlasting sleep, never to wake again,” declares the King, whose name is Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="58">“The attacking army will demolish the massive walls protecting Babylon and burn down the lofty gates of the city. The nations wear themselves out to no avail; they will see the flames destroy what they’ve done,” declares Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="59">Now Jeremiah had written all these prophecies of Babylon’s doom on a scroll. In the fourth year of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, the king traveled to Babylonia, accompanied by his personal attendant, Seraiah son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah. Jeremiah gave Seraiah the scroll</verse>
				<verse number="60"></verse>
				<verse number="61">together with this command: “When you arrive in Babylon, be sure to read all the prophecies written on this scroll to all the people.</verse>
				<verse number="62">Afterward, pray this prayer: ‘O  Yahweh, you have promised to destroy this place so that no one will live here ever again, neither human nor animal. You said it will be desolate forever.’</verse>
				<verse number="63">“Then, Seraiah, when you finish reading this book to the people, tie a heavy stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates River</verse>
				<verse number="64">with these words: ‘Just as this scroll will sink, so Babylon will sink to the depths, never to rise again from the disaster I am going to bring on her.’ ” This ends Jeremiah’s writings.</verse>

			<chapter number="52">
				<verse number="1">Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king. He reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah, of Libnah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He did what was displeasing in the sight of Yahweh, just as King Jehoiakim had done.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh became so angry with the people of Jerusalem and Judah that he banished them from the land. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="4">In the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked Jerusalem with his entire army and laid siege to it.</verse>
				<verse number="5">After the city had been surrounded for a year and half, they broke through the city walls.</verse>
				<verse number="6">On the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine was so severe in the city that there was nothing left to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="7">That was when the Babylonians broke through the city wall. That same night, Zedekiah and his soldiers tried to escape through the gate between the two walls near the royal garden even though they knew the enemy had the city surrounded. They fled toward the Jordan Valley,</verse>
				<verse number="8">but the Babylonians pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his army deserted him there and fled.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The Babylonians captured him and brought him to King Nebuchadnezzar, who was based at the town of Riblah in the territory of Hamath, where he passed sentence on Zedekiah.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Nebuchadnezzar had Zedekiah’s sons slaughtered at Riblah, and Zedekiah was forced to watch their execution. The king of Babylon also executed all the officials of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him with chains. Then they dragged him off blinded to distant Babylon and put him in prison till the day of his death.</verse>
				<verse number="12">In the nineteenth year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon, on the tenth day of the fifth month of that year, the field general Nebuzaradan, who served the king, entered Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He burned down the temple of Yahweh, the royal palace, and all the homes of the wealthy of Jerusalem, and other buildings went up in flames.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The Babylonians under the command of Nebuzaradan demolished all the walls surrounding Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Nebuzaradan, the field general, took as prisoners some of the poor who were left behind in Jerusalem, together with the skilled workers and the deserters who had gone over to him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But he also left behind some of the extremely poor people in the land of Judah. They owned nothing, but he gave them vineyards and fields of their own.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The Babylonians took everything of value from the temple of Yahweh. They smashed the bronze pillars and confiscated the wheeled stands and the bronze laver. Everything made of bronze they carried off to Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They also took the ash pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the sprinkling bowls, the incense bowls, and all the bronze vessels that had been used in worship.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The field general took away every small bowl, the censers, the sprinkling bowls, the ash containers, the lampstands, the ladles, and the saucers —everything that was made of gold or silver.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But the two pillars, the one sea and the twelve bronze bulls on their movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of Yahweh, were too heavy to weigh.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Both pillars were identical, and each stood eighteen cubits high. Their circumference was twelve cubits, and they were four fingers thick and hollow inside.</verse>
				<verse number="22">On top of each column was a large section of bronze; its height was over five cubits, and all around it were filigree and pomegranates, all in bronze.</verse>
				<verse number="23">There was a total of one hundred pomegranates on the filigree all around, and ninety-six were visible from the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Nebuzaradan, the field general, arrested Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank, and other temple officials.</verse>
				<verse number="25">In the city he arrested an official who was in command of the fighting men, seven of the king’s closest associates, who were discovered in the city, the secretary to the army commander responsible for mustering the troops, and sixty men of distinction.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The field general took these men and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.</verse>
				<verse number="27">At Riblah, in the territory of Hamath, the king of Babylon had them executed. And so, the people of Judah were taken into exile.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Here is the record of the number of those deported by Nebuchadnezzar in the seventh year of his reign: 3,023 men from Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="29">In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, he deported 832 persons from Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="30">In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Nebuzaradan, the field general, deported 745 Judeans. In all, 4,600 persons were deported.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Thirty-seven years after King Jehoiachin was taken away as a prisoner, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of that year, King Evil-merodach of Babylon showed kindness to Jehoiachin by releasing him from prison. This was in Evil-merodach’s first year as king.</verse>
				<verse number="32">The king of Babylon treated Jehoiachin kindly and gave him a position of honor above the other kings.</verse>
				<verse number="33">So Jehoiachin laid aside his prison clothes and, for the rest of his life, always ate at the king’s table.</verse>
				<verse number="34">At the command of the king of Babylon, everything that he needed was given to him each day until his death.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">How lonely sits the city once thronged with people! Once great among the nations, she is now lonely like a widow. Once a fair princess ruling among the provinces, now a shackled servant.</verse>
				<verse number="2">She is weeping bitterly through the night, with tears streaming down her cheeks. Among all her lovers, not one can be found to comfort her. Her friends have all betrayed her and have now become her enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Judah’s people have gone into exile under harsh labor and much pain. They found no place to rest living among foreigners. All their enemies have seized them in the narrow passes.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The empty roads to Zion mourn, for no one travels to her sacred feasts anymore. The singing maidens suffer, and the priests can only groan. The city gates stand empty, and Zion can only moan.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Her foes have the upper hand while her enemies are now at ease. For Yahweh has made Jerusalem suffer for her many, many sins. Her young children are taken into captivity as captives before the oppressor.</verse>
				<verse number="6">All the splendor has departed from the fair daughter of Zion. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture. Weak and weary they stumble, unable to flee from those who pursue them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">In her days of wandering and affliction, Jerusalem still remembers all her precious treasures that were hers from days gone by. When the enemies defeated her people, there was no one to help her. Her conquerors looked on, jeering and cheering at her downfall.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jerusalem has committed a horrible sin and has become an object of scorn. All who once honored her now despise her, for they have seen her nakedness. Shunned, she groans aloud and turns to hide her face in shame.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Her filth stains her skirts— she never pictured this outcome. Therefore, her fall is terrible with no one to comfort her. Jerusalem groans, “ Yahweh, look how miserable I am; all the while my enemy gloats!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">The enemy has seized all her precious treasures. Before her very eyes she witnessed foreigners enter her holy sanctuary, although you had forbidden them ever to enter your assembly.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Everyone is groaning, longing for anything to eat; they have traded their treasures for food in order to keep themselves alive. “Look, Yahweh, and consider how pathetic I have become!</verse>
				<verse number="12">“None who passes by even cares. Turn around and look at me! Is there anyone who suffers as much as I? Yahweh, in the terrible day of your fierce anger, you punished me worst of all.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“From on high, he sent a fire deep in my bones, and it conquered me. He trapped my feet in his snare and hurled me back. He left me stunned in misery that had no end.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“ Yahweh took my sins in his hands and tied them into a yoke. Then, he set his yoke upon my neck and caused my strength to fail. The Lord let my enemies defeat me; I am helpless to resist.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“The Lord has despised and rejected all the mighty warriors who defended me. He mobilized an army to destroy me and crush my young men. The Lord has trampled like grapes in a winepress the fair daughter of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“This is why I weep bitterly, as tears stream down my cheeks. Truly, no one is here to comfort me or revive my life. My children no longer have a future, for the enemy has triumphed.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Zion stretches out her hands for help, but there is no one to comfort her. At Yahweh ’s command, Jacob’s neighbors became her enemies. They all treated Jerusalem as though she were a bloody rag.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“ Yahweh is just to judge, for I have rebelled against his word. Listen, everyone, and see my sorrow; my maidens and young men have gone into captivity.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“I called to my lovers, but they cheated on me. My leaders and priests died in the city while scrounging for food just to keep themselves alive.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“ Yahweh, can’t you see I’m in deep trouble? My gut is churning and my heart is burning— how rebellious I have been! The sword rules on the street; plague rules within the houses.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“They have heard my groans, yet I have no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad you have done this to me. You threatened me and kept your promise— oh, that the same would happen to them!</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Let all their wickedness condemn them. Deal with them as you have dealt with me for all my sins. My groaning seems endless, and I am sick at heart.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">The Lord was so angry that he shrouded the daughter of Zion with shame. He hurled down to the ground the splendor of Israel. He disregarded his footstool on the day of his anger.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The Lord has swallowed up without mercy all the homes of Jacob’s descendants. In his fury, he tore down the fortresses of Daughter Judah. He threw to the ground and brought disgrace to the kingdom of Judah and her leaders.</verse>
				<verse number="3">In his burning anger, he shattered all the might of Israel as her enemies approached. He raged among his people like a flaming fire, which consumes everything near it.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He bent his bow like an enemy and clenched his fist like a foe. Like an enemy, he slaughtered all his pride and joy. He poured out his fury like fire on the temple of beloved Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The Lord became our enemy; he destroyed Israel. He devastated all her palaces and ruined her strongholds. He has multiplied weeping and wailing for Daughter Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He wrecked his temple like a vineyard shack and utterly destroyed his meeting place. Yahweh erased the memory in Zion of his appointed feasts and Sabbaths. In the heat of his anger, he spurned both king and priest.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The Lord has rejected his own altar and disowned his sanctuary. He has given the walls of her fortresses to her enemies. When the enemy toppled Yahweh ’s temple, they shouted for joy like it was a festival day.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh was determined to destroy the walls of beloved Zion. As builders draw a straight line to build a wall, he stretched out the line of judgment to break down her walls. He caused her walls and towers to mourn, as they tumbled to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Her gates have collapsed to the ground; he has wrecked and shattered their bars. Her king and leaders are captives among the gentiles, and instruction from the Torah scrolls is no more. Her prophets, too, receive no vision from Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The elders of beloved Zion sit mute on the ground. They have thrown dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young virgins of Jerusalem bow their heads in sorrow to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="11">My eyes have no tears left, and my stomach is tied in knots. My heart is spilled out into the dirt over the destruction of the daughter of my people. Little toddlers and children collapse in the streets of the city.</verse>
				<verse number="12">They keep saying, “Mommy, I’m hungry,” as they faint like wounded men in the city streets. Their souls trickle away, and they breathe their last in the embrace of their mothers.</verse>
				<verse number="13">With what can I compare you? What can I say to you, beloved Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, in order to comfort you, fair Zion? For your wound is as deep as the sea. Who can heal you?</verse>
				<verse number="14">The visions your prophets saw for you were false and deceptive whitewash. They neither exposed your guilt nor brought you back in repentance. The false visions they told you were nothing but delusions.</verse>
				<verse number="15">All who pass your way applaud in mockery. They wag their heads with contempt, saying over beloved Jerusalem, “Is this really the city called The Perfection of Beauty, The Joy of All the Earth?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Your enemies are a choir of scoffers and scolders. They hatefully sneer and glare at you. They gleefully exclaim, “We have destroyed her. This is the day we’ve been waiting for, and now we have lived to see it!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yahweh has done everything he planned and has carried out his word. As he ordained long ago, he has destroyed without pity. He increased the power of your foes and caused your enemies to rejoice over you.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Beloved Zion, let your walls wail and your heart cry out to Yahweh. Let a waterfall of tears flow day and night. Give your eyes no rest; let tears keep streaming from your eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Arise, cry aloud through the night as each watch begins. Pour your heart out like water before the presence of Yahweh. Raise your hands toward him; intercede for the lives of your children, who faint with hunger on every street corner.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Look, Yahweh, and please consider. Whom have you ever treated this way? Should women eat their offspring, the little ones they have nursed? Should priests and prophets be slaughtered in the Lord’s sanctuary?</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Both children and the elderly alike are lying dead in the dusty streets. My young men and maidens have both fallen by the sword. You have killed them on the day of your anger; you slaughtered them without mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“You invited terror as if to a festival, to attack me from all sides. On the day of Yahweh ’s anger, none escaped and none survived. All whom I cherished and reared have been annihilated by the enemy.”</verse>

			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">I am the man acquainted with misery by the rod of his anger.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He has shepherded me into dark places with no light.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He laid a heavy hand on me, every day, over and over.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He has made my skin and my flesh waste away; he has broken my bones.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He has besieged and encircled me with a wall of hardship and bitterness.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He has made me sit in darkness like those long dead.</verse>
				<verse number="7">He has walled me in with no way out and weighed me down with heavy chains.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Even when I cry for help, he closes his ear to my prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He has made my paths a maze and obstructed my ways.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He has become to me like a bear ready to pounce or a lion lying in wait.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He dragged me away, tore me to pieces, and then left me stunned and helpless.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He has drawn back his bowstring and used me as a target for his arrows.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He shot his arrows deep into my heart, sons from his quiver.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Everyone has made me an object of ridicule; they mock me all day long with their songs.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He has given me my fill of bitterness and made me drunk with wormwood.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He has ground my teeth with gravel and crushed me down to the dust.</verse>
				<verse number="17">You have snatched peace from my soul; I have entirely forgotten your goodness.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I thought to myself, “My endurance has evaporated; Yahweh has stamped out my hope for the future.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">I remember wandering around in misery, drinking the poison of bitterness.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Whenever I ponder this, my soul fades away within me.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yet there is one ray of hope when I remember this:</verse>
				<verse number="22">Yahweh ’s tender mercies have no end, and the kindness of his endless love is never exhausted.</verse>
				<verse number="23">New, fresh mercies greet me with every sunrise. So wonderfully great is your faithfulness!</verse>
				<verse number="24">I tell my soul, “ Yahweh is my abundant portion. I need nothing more. So, I will put all my hope in him.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Yahweh is always good to all who trust in him, to the soul who searches for him.</verse>
				<verse number="26">It is always good to hope, quietly waiting for Yahweh ’s deliverance.</verse>
				<verse number="27">It is always good to learn patience and humility from a young age.</verse>
				<verse number="28">If your burden is heavy and hard to bear, endure it quietly.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Bow low in humble submission, for there may still be hope.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Offer a cheek to the one who would strike you, and learn to endure insults.</verse>
				<verse number="31">For the Lord will not reject you forever.</verse>
				<verse number="32">If he causes grief, he will show compassion from the cascading overflow of his endless love.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The Lord takes no delight in afflicting anyone with suffering.</verse>
				<verse number="34">To trample underfoot all the earth’s prisoners,</verse>
				<verse number="35">to violate human rights in the presence of the Most High,</verse>
				<verse number="36">to cheat someone of justice— these things the Lord does not approve.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Who can make anything happen unless the Lord is willing?</verse>
				<verse number="38">Is it not from the decree of the Most High that both calamities and good things come?</verse>
				<verse number="39">Why, then, should anyone complain over the punishment of their sins?</verse>
				<verse number="40">Let us examine our path, ponder our ways, and return to Yahweh ’s heart.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Let us pray, offering up our hearts in our hands to our God above.</verse>
				<verse number="42">“We have sinned and rebelled, and you have not yet pardoned us.</verse>
				<verse number="43">“You have blanketed us with your anger and then pursued us, slaughtering without pity.</verse>
				<verse number="44">You shrouded yourself in a cloud too thick for prayer to pierce.</verse>
				<verse number="45">You have reduced us to rubbish; we are the lowest scum among the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="46">“Our enemies are a choir of scoffers and scolders.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Panic and pitfall have been our portion; calamity and collapse have come upon us.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">My eyes stream with torrents of tears as I weep over the ruin of my beloved people.</verse>
				<verse number="49">My eyes will weep without stopping, with no relief in sight</verse>
				<verse number="50">until Yahweh looks down from heaven and sees how much we suffer.</verse>

				<verse number="52">My enemies, who hate me for no reason, have trapped me like a bird.</verse>
				<verse number="53">They buried me alive in a pit and covered it with stones.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Water rose over my head; I thought, “I’m going to die!”</verse>
				<verse number="55">I called on your name, Yahweh, from the bottom of the pit.</verse>
				<verse number="56">You have heard me cry out to you: “Do not close your ears to my sighs and to my cries.”</verse>
				<verse number="57">You drew near when I called to you. You told me, “Do not be afraid!”</verse>
				<verse number="58">Lord, like a lawyer you contended for my cause; you liberated my life, my Redeemer.</verse>
				<verse number="59">Yahweh, you have seen the wrong done to me; judge in my favor.</verse>
				<verse number="60">You have seen their malice and all their hateful plots against me.</verse>
				<verse number="61">You have heard their mockery, Yahweh, all their horrible schemes against me.</verse>
				<verse number="62">They murmur and whisper against me all day long.</verse>
				<verse number="63">See, from morning to night, I am the butt of their jokes.</verse>
				<verse number="64">Yahweh, repay them! Give them what their deeds deserve.</verse>

				<verse number="1">How the gold has lost its luster! How the pure gold has lost its value! The sacred stones lie scattered at the corner of every street.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The precious children of Zion, once worth their weight in the finest gold, are now regarded as jars of clay made by a potter’s hands.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Even the vicious jackal is kind enough to nurse her young, but the daughter of my people is as cruel as the desert ostrich.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The nursing babies have such thirst that their tongues stick to the roofs of their mouths. Little children ask for bread, but no one gives them a crumb.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Those who used to feast on delicacies now lie dying in the streets. Those who were raised in luxury now huddle in garbage dumps.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The punishment of my beloved people exceeded the judgment of sinful Sodom, which was suddenly destroyed without an army attacking her.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Israel’s nobility was once brighter than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies glowed with health and glistened like jewels.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now their faces are emaciated; they are not even recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones, as dry as a stick.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Better are those killed by the sword than those killed by famine. They slowly starve to death for lack of food.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The hands of caring women cooked their own children; they became their food when my beloved people were destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="11">At the peak of Yahweh ’s wrath, he vented his fierce anger! He lit a fire in Zion and burned it down to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="12">No king believed, nor anyone anywhere, that a hostile foe could ever break through the gates of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yet this happened because of the sins of her prophets and the crimes of her priests, who shed innocent blood in the heart of the city.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They wandered blindly through the city and were so defiled with blood that no one dared to even touch their clothes.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Get away! Unclean!” people shouted at them. “Keep back! Keep back! Don’t touch!” So, they fled Jerusalem and wandered to the nations, but they were not welcome to stay there either.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The face of Yahweh scattered them; he will look on them no more. They had no respect for the priests, no honor for her leaders.</verse>
				<verse number="17">We strained our eyes continually and looked, watching for help that never came. From our watchtowers we waited for a nation to help, for a nation that could not save us.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Men stalked us so that we could not walk on our streets. Our end drew near, our time ran out, for our end had come.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky; they hunted us on the mountains and lay in ambush for us in the wilderness.</verse>
				<verse number="20">They captured Yahweh ’s anointed leader, our king; the hope of our survival was caught in their traps. We thought that under his protective shadow we would live among the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Go ahead, you people of Edom and Uz, laugh on and be glad like nothing will happen to you! Your day is coming to drink from this cup; you will get drunk and stagger naked.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">I am Ezekiel the son of Buzi, a priest. I was living among the Jewish exiles in Babylon by the River Chebar. One day when I was thirty, the heavens opened before my eyes, and I saw visions of God! It happened on the fifth day of the fourth month during the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile. It was then that the word of Yahweh was powerfully revealed to me, and I felt the mighty hand of Yahweh come upon me!</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">As I looked into the spirit realm, I saw a fierce whirlwind and a massive cloud coming toward me from the north. Within the approaching cloud I saw raging flames of fire—flames enfolding themselves in flames! And outlining the glory cloud was a radiant light. And in the center of the flashing fire, I saw a substance of blinding brilliance with the appearance of electrum.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And I also saw standing in the middle of the storm what seemed to be four creatures, each with the appearance of a man. They looked like this:</verse>
				<verse number="6">Each had four faces, and each had four wings.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Their legs were straight, but they had hooves like calves. Their hooves were bright and glistening like polished brass.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All four of them had faces and wings, and each of the supernatural beings had a pair of human hands under its wings. There were hands on all four sides of the living creatures.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They joined one another with their wings, forming a square. When they moved forward in whatever direction, they went together as a group, without turning their bodies.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And all four beings had four faces: a human face in front, a lion’s face to the right, an ox’s face to the left, and an eagle’s face in the back.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Their wings were divided into two pairs; one pair was extended upward so that each one touched the wingtips of the one next to it, and the other pair covered its body.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And each one moved straight forward, moving where the Spirit directed them, and they did not turn as they moved.</verse>
				<verse number="13">These living creatures looked like burning coals of fire, like blazing torches. Flames flashed back and forth between the creatures. The light was blinding, and lightning was flashing out of it.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And the living creatures kept disappearing and reappearing like shooting stars.</verse>
				<verse number="15">As I observed the four-faced creatures, I saw four shining wheels standing on the ground beside each of them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">All four wheels looked entirely alike, glittering like sparkling jewels. Each appeared to have another wheel inside it.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And the wheels were able to go in any direction the living creatures faced without turning to change direction.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The circumference of the rims seemed enormous, breathtaking in size, and all four rims were full of eyes all the way around.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Regardless of the direction the living creatures moved, the wheels moved with them, and when the living creatures levitated off the ground, the wheels levitated also.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And the spirit in the living creatures was also in the wheels, and wherever the spirit went, the creatures went. Wherever the spirit wanted to go, the creatures went there, and the wheels also rose and went with them.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So every time the creatures moved, or halted, or levitated, the wheels did also because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Suspended above the living creatures I saw something that looked like a platform spread out above them. The platform was fearsome, transparent, and shining like sparkling glass.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And under the platform were the four living creatures with wings outstretched and touching one another and each with a pair of wings covering its body.</verse>
				<verse number="24">When they moved, I heard the awesome sound of their wings. It was like the noise of roaring rapids, like the voice of Shaddai, and like the sound of an army advancing! And when the creatures stopped moving, they lowered their wings.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then, as they stood still, I heard someone speaking from above the platform over their heads.</verse>
				<verse number="26">High on the platform over their heads, I saw something that looked like a beautiful throne made of sapphire. And high above on the throne was one who had the form of a man.</verse>
				<verse number="27">I saw what appeared to be his waist upward, and it was bright and dazzling metal; and from what appeared to be his waist downward, I saw what looked like flames of fire, giving off a brilliant light all around.</verse>
				<verse number="28">The radiance of the light encircling the throne had in it every color of the rainbow like on the day of a downpour. This was the appearance of the glory of Yahweh! And when I saw this, I fell on my face. Then, I heard the voice of someone speaking to me.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">He said to me, “Son of man, rise to your feet; I want to talk to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">The moment I heard these words, the Spirit flowed into me and set me upright on my feet.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And I heard him speaking to me, saying, “Son of man, I am sending you to the rebellious sons of Israel who have refused allegiance to me. They and their ancestors have been in revolt against me up to the present day.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I am sending you to a stubborn and hard-hearted people. Tell them, ‘Lord Yahweh says this.’</verse>
				<verse number="5">And whether they listen or not, this tribe of defiant rebels will know that a true prophet is among them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or of anything they say, even though you may feel like you are stepping on thorns and sitting on scorpions. Do not be afraid of their angry words or intimidated by their glaring stares, for they are rebellion personified!</verse>
				<verse number="7">You are to speak my words to them whether they listen to you or rebelliously refuse.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But you, son of man, listen to what I am saying to you: do not be like them, for they are a tribe of rebels. Now, open your mouth and eat what I am about to give you.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Just then, I saw a hand holding a scroll reaching out to me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He unrolled it in front of me with writing on both sides. On it was written “Lament, Mourning, and Cries of Doom.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you see in front of you; eat this scroll, then go and speak to the people of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">So I opened my mouth, and he fed me the scroll,</verse>
				<verse number="3">saying, “Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving to you and fill your belly with it.” So I began to chew it, and it tasted as sweet as honey.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then he said, “Son of man, now go to the people of Israel and speak my words to them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I am not sending you to a nation that speaks a difficult foreign language but to the people of Israel—</verse>
				<verse number="6">not to nations whose complex languages you could not understand and who speak words you cannot even pronounce. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you,</verse>
				<verse number="7">but the people of Israel will refuse to listen to you because they refuse to listen to me. The whole family of Israel has a hard heart and is stubbornly defiant.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But now, I will make you as stubborn and defiant as they are!</verse>
				<verse number="9">I will make your resolve as hard as the hardest stone, even harder than flint. So do not fear them or be afraid because of their angry stares, for they are a tribe of rebels.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then he said, “Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart everything I say to you,</verse>
				<verse number="11">then go to the Jews in exile and say to them, ‘Listen to what Lord Yahweh says,’ whether they listen or not.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then the Spirit lifted me up, and behind me I heard a loud, thunderous voice: “Blessed be the glory of Yahweh in his sanctuary!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">I heard the sound of the living creatures as their wings kissed each other and the sound of the rumbling wheels beside them, like the sound of a great earthquake.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I went in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Yahweh rested powerfully upon me.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The Spirit took me to Tel Abib, the very place where the Jewish exiles were living beside the River Chebar. I remained there with them for a week, dumbfounded and overwhelmed by what I had seen and heard.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Afterward, Yahweh spoke the following words to me:</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Son of man, I am appointing you as a watchman for the people of Israel. When you hear me speak to you, give them my warning.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If I say to wicked people, ‘You are headed toward certain death,’ and you fail to give them warning by not speaking up to warn the evil ones against their evil courses so as to keep them alive, then the wicked ones will die for their sinful deeds. But I will hold you responsible for their deaths.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But if you do warn the wicked and they keep sinning anyway, they’ll most certainly die for their sin, but you won’t die. You’ll have saved your life.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And if righteous people turn away from righteous living and pursue a life of sin, I will set calamities before them, and they will die. Because you did not give them warning, they will die for their sinful deeds, and all the righteous deeds done earlier in life will not be remembered. But I will hold you responsible for their deaths.</verse>
				<verse number="21">If, however, you do warn a righteous person not to sin and he responds to your warning, that person will live, and you will have also saved your life.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">While I was there, Yahweh seized me with his power, and he said to me, “Stand up, go out into the valley, and I will speak with you there.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So I got up and went down into the valley and behold, the awesome glory of Yahweh manifested in front of me! It was like the vision of glory I had seen by the River Chebar, and I fell facedown.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then the Spirit flowed into me and set me on my feet. And I heard him say to me: “Go home and shut the door behind you.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Behold! Son of man, you are about to be tied up with ropes and confined to your house and unable to mingle among the people.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And I am going to make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth; you will be mute and unable to speak to rebuke this rebellious people.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But whenever I want to speak through you, I will give you back the power of speech. And then you will say to them, ‘This is what Lord Yahweh says: If you have a heart to hear, then hear! If you refuse to listen, then so be it!’—for they are a tribe of rebels.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh said, “Son of man, take a clay tile and lay it in front of you. Sketch the city of Jerusalem on the tile.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Build a wall around it and, to represent a siege, pile up a dirt ramp against the wall. Then prepare to attack it as if it were a real city. Surround it with armed soldiers and station battering rams on all sides.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then take an iron frying pan and place it on edge as though it were an iron wall between you and the city. Then direct your gaze toward the city, for it is under siege and you are besieging it. This is to be a sign, an object lesson for the people of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Then lie down on your left side and stay like that for 390 days. The people of Israel sinned for 390 years, and you will lie one day for each year they sinned. You will symbolically bear their guilt for as many days as you lie on that side and bear their punishment.</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6">After that, lie down a second time but turn over on your right side and stay like that for forty days, one day for each year of the guilt of the people of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then direct your gaze on the model of the siege of Jerusalem, shake your fist at the city and prophesy against her.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Behold, I am going to tie you up, and you will not be able to turn from one side to the other until the period of your seclusion is over.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Now take some wheat, barley, beans, lentils, and other grains; store them all together and make bread for yourself. This will be your food for the 390 days you are lying on your side.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Of these grains, make a small loaf of bread at a set time each day.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And you are to ration the water you drink to two cups at a set time each day.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Eat the food as you would a barley cake. While everyone can see you, build a fire with dried human excrement, then bake the bread on the coals.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">And Yahweh said, “In this same way the Israelites will have to eat defiled food among the nations where I will disperse them.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then I replied, “Oh no! Lord Yahweh, I have never defiled myself, from childhood until now. I have never eaten meat from any animal that died a natural death or was killed by wild animals. Nothing unclean has ever entered my mouth.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Very well,” he said, “I will let you use dried cow manure instead of human excrement as fuel to bake your bread.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then he added, “Son of man, I am going to cut off Jerusalem’s food supply. In their horrible distress, the food they eat and the water they drink will be rationed.</verse>
				<verse number="17">They will watch as it all runs out and look at each other in total despair. And they will slowly die of starvation because of their guilt.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh said, “Son of man, take a sharp sword; use it like a barber’s razor and shave your head and beard. Then take scales and divide the hair into three piles.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When the days of your siege are over, burn up a third in the midst of the city of Jerusalem. Take another third and chop it up with the sword around the perimeter of the tile-city. Then scatter the last third to the wind. I will pursue those who escape the city with my sword.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Also keep back a few hairs and wrap them up in the folds of your cloak.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And of those, take just a few hairs and throw them on the fire and burn them. That fire will spread to all the people of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Listen to what the Lord Yahweh says: “This represents Jerusalem. I have placed her in the center of the nations, encircled by foreign countries.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Yet she has rebelled more wickedly against my ways and against my laws than the gentile nations that surround her. Indeed, she has deliberately rejected my commands and not kept my laws.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Therefore, the Lord Yahweh says, “Because you acted more wickedly than the nations around you, since you do not keep my laws or respect my commands, and since you do not respect even the moral standards of the surrounding nations,</verse>
				<verse number="8">therefore, behold—I, Lord Yahweh, declare that I am against you. And I will pass my judgment on you for all the nations to see.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Because of all your loathsome practices, I am coming against you more severely than I have ever done before or will ever do again.</verse>
				<verse number="10">As a result, those of you who are parents will eat their children, and children will eat their parents. I will punish you and scatter what remains of you to the winds.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“For as surely as I live, I, Lord Yahweh, declare: because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your horrible and loathsome practices, I will withdraw from you and will not even glance on you with pity or spare you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Inside Jerusalem, a third of your people will die of plague or starvation. Outside the city, a third will fall by the sword. And a third I will scatter to the winds and pursue with my sword.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then my anger will come to an end and be fully spent against them, and then my justice will have been satisfied. When I have carried out my anger against them, they will know how jealous I am for them. Afterward, they will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my zeal.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Moreover, I will reduce you to a heap of ruins, an object of scorn to the surrounding nations, in the eyes of all who pass by.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You will be mocked and insulted. Your downfall will be an appalling lesson to the surrounding nations. This will happen when I execute judgment on you in my furious anger and with my furious punishment. I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“I will release against them the deadly arrows of famine—arrows of destruction! Then I will make the famine even worse and cut off your food supply.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I will send severe famine and wild animals against you to rob you of your children. Sickness and bloodshed will overtake you, and I will bring the sword down upon you. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh said to me:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, turn toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Say to them, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the words of Lord Yahweh! He prophesies to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: “ ‘I am wielding a sword against you and I will demolish your shrines.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Your altars will be deserted, and your incense altars will be smashed. I will slay your people before your idols.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I will lay the corpses of the Israelites before their idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Wherever you live, your cities will be ruined and your shrines deserted. All your altars will be destroyed and desecrated, and your idols shall be broken and banished. Your incense altars will be chopped down, and all your works wiped out.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The slain will lie everywhere in your midst, and you will know that I am Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="8">“ ‘I will spare some of you who escape the sword when you are scattered among the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Those who escape will remember me among the nations where they are exiles. They will remember how my heart was crushed by their promiscuous ways when they turned their hearts away from me and by their wandering eyes that lusted after idols. They will loathe themselves for the evil things they did and all their detestable practices.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And they will realize that it was no idle threat when I, Yahweh, declared that I would bring this severe punishment upon them.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Hear the words of Lord Yahweh: “Stomp your feet angrily and pound your fist, and say, ‘How awful!’ over all the evil abominations of the people of Israel. For they will fall by the sword, by food shortages, and by plague.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Those far away will die by the plague, those nearby shall fall by the sword, and those who survive will die of hunger. They will experience the fullness of my fury!</verse>
				<verse number="13">“And you will be convinced that I am Yahweh when their corpses lie scattered around their idols and around their altars, on every high hill, on every mountaintop, under every spreading tree, and under every leafy oak—every place where they have offered soothing incense to all their lifeless idols.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will stretch out my mighty arm against them and turn the land wherever they live into a complete wasteland from the desert to Riblah. And when this happens, they will be convinced that I am Yahweh!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me and said,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, tell the people of Israel what I, Lord Yahweh, say to the land of Israel: ‘Finished! The end has come over all the land.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now the end has come. I will unleash my anger on you and judge you for the way you have lived. I will judge you for all your loathsome practices.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I will not show you pity nor spare you. Indeed, I will punish you for your conduct—the despicable evil you have done. Then you all will be convinced that I am Yahweh.’</verse>
				<verse number="5">“The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Look! An unheard-of disaster is coming.</verse>
				<verse number="6">It’s all over for you! The end is near! Doom is awakened against you. Behold, the fateful day!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now it is your turn to be punished. You who dwell in this land, doom is coming, for the day of Yahweh is near. The people will be shouting in panic, not shouting with joy at the shrines on the mountaintops.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Very soon I will vent my fury on you and punish you until my anger is finished. I will judge you for the way you live and punish you for all your loathsome practices.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I will show you no mercy nor spare you, but I will punish you for your conduct and for all your detestable deeds. Then you will know that I am Yahweh who has punished you.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“ ‘Now is the day of disaster. Behold, your doom has come! Brutality has blossomed, and pride is at its peak.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Violence has grown up into a rod to punish their wickedness. None of these proud, evil people will survive. All their wealth and prestige will be swept away.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The time of your doom is before you; the day of reckoning has come. Let not the buyer be happy nor the seller be sad, for wrath is upon the entire multitude.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For the seller will not be able to return to what has been sold while they live. For the vision concerns them all. Each persists in sin, and no one will hold on to their lives.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The trumpet sounds, everyone gets ready, but no one goes into battle, since my anger rests on everyone alike.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“ ‘Enemies are lurking outside the city; inside are disease and starvation. Anyone out in the countryside will die in battle; anyone in the city will die by starvation and plague.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And those who escape will flee to the mountains, moaning like doves of the valleys, each one moaning for his sin.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Every hand will grow weak. Gripped with fear, they wet themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Terror covers them as they put on sackcloth. Shame covers their faces as they shave their heads bald.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They will throw their silver away in the streets and their gold like filthy menstrual rags. Their wealth will not be able to save them on the day of Yahweh ’s fury. For it will be worthless on that day to buy food to fill their stomachs since it was their wealth that led them into sin.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Once they were so proud of their beautiful jewelry, out of which they made their disgusting, horrible idols. Now I have made their wealth and jewels repulsive to them.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I will give your wealth to foreigners, as spoils of war to the evilest people on earth, and they will profane it.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I will turn my face away from them while my hidden, treasured place is profaned and thugs force their way in and defile it.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“ ‘Prepare plenty of chains to bind up the captives. For the country is full of bloodshed and murders, and the city is full of violence,</verse>
				<verse number="24">so I will bring evil nations here to seize their homes. I will put an end to the pride of their elite, and their sanctuary will be profaned.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Panic is on the way! They will look for peace but never find it.</verse>
				<verse number="26">One disaster will follow another, with rumor upon rumor. They will seek a vision from the prophet but in vain. The priestly teaching of the divine law will be destroyed, along with the counsel of the elders.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The king will go into mourning, the officials will be wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people will tremble in terror. I will punish them for the way they have lived and judge them the same way as they have judged others. Then they will be convinced that I am Yahweh!’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">In the sixth year of our exile, on the fifth day of the sixth month, the elders of Judah and I were sitting in my home. Suddenly, I felt the mighty power of the Lord Yahweh come over me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Behold, I saw a fiery human figure. His body looked like fire! Below the waist were flames of fire; above the waist he glistened as bright as glowing bronze.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He reached out with what seemed like a hand and grabbed me by my hair. Then, in a great and wonderful vision from God, the Spirit lifted me up high in the air and transported me to Jerusalem. He took me to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court where the disgusting idol that provokes Yahweh ’s jealousy was standing.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And all at once, the dazzling glory of the God of Israel appeared! It looked like what I had seen in the Euphrates Valley.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then God said, “Son of man, look now to the north.” So, I raised my eyes to the north, and standing there, north of the pathway entrance of the altar gate was this vile statue that infuriates God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And he said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing? Look at all the repulsive, loathsome things that the people of Israel are practicing here! Their disgusting deeds drive me farther and farther from my sanctuary. And you will see even more shocking things than these.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">He next transported me to the entrance to the outer courtyard. I looked carefully and noticed there was a hole in the wall.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He said, “Son of man, dig through the wall.” When I dug into the wall, I discovered a doorway.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He said, “Now, go in and look at the shocking, despicable things they are doing inside.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So I went through the door, and I noticed the walls were covered with drawings of every kind of snake, bugs, creeping things, repulsive animals, and all the disgusting idols of the people of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Worshiping these animals were seventy leaders of Israel, and standing among them was Jaazaniah son of Shaphan. Each one had an incense burner in his hand, from which rose a fragrant cloud of incense.</verse>
				<verse number="12">God said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what these leaders of Israel are doing in secret, each one worshiping in his own personal shrine? They say, ‘Oh, Yahweh cannot see us; he has left the land.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then God said, “ This is not even the worst of the practices. You will see things more terrible than this.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Next he took me to the entrance of the north gate of the temple of Yahweh where women were weeping over the death of the god Tammuz.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He said, “Son of man, do you see their worship of Tammuz? You will see even more terrible things than that.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Next he transported me to the north gate to the inner court of his temple. And there, at the entrance to Yahweh ’s sanctuary, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men standing with their faces to the east worshiping the sun with their backs to Yahweh ’s sanctuary. They bowed down to the east, before the rising sun.</verse>
				<verse number="17">God said to me, “Son of man, do you see this? It is bad enough that the people of Judah are doing these despicable things, but they also spread violence throughout the land and provoke my anger further! Look at how they insult me in every possible way they can.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Therefore, with wrath I will deal with them. I will show neither pity nor mercy. They can cry to me as loudly as they want, but I will not listen to them.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Then I heard the Lord shout loudly for me to hear, “Executioners, draw near! Each bring your weapon of destruction!”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Immediately six men advanced from the upper north gate, each one holding a deadly weapon. Also, I saw with them a man clothed in white linen, with a scribe’s case tied to his belt. They came and stood in front of the bronze altar.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then the dazzling glory of the God of Israel rose from above the cherubim where it had been resting and moved toward the threshold of the temple. Then he called to the man dressed in white linen with a scribe’s case at his side,</verse>
				<verse number="4">and Yahweh said to him, “Go throughout Jerusalem, and place a mark on the foreheads of all who grieve and are greatly distressed over all the disgusting things done in the city.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">And I heard him say to the other six, “Follow the man in white linen through the city and strike down everyone with no mark on their forehead —old men, young men, girls, children, women—kill them all. Show no mercy, not even one glance of pity. But do not touch anyone with a mark on his forehead. And begin at my sanctuary.” So, they began with those men in front of the temple and with the elders.</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">He said to the executioners, “Go make my temple unfit for worship. Fill its courtyard with corpses. Now get to work.” They departed and began to strike the people throughout the city.</verse>
				<verse number="8">While they were slaying, I was left alone in the temple. I threw myself facedown on the ground and cried out, “Oh, Lord Yahweh, are you really going to wipe out the remnant of Israel by venting your fury on Jerusalem?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">He answered me, “The guilt of the people of Israel and Judah is enormous. The land is full of bloodshed, and Jerusalem full of perverted justice. They say, ‘ Yahweh can’t see us! He has abandoned the nation.’</verse>
				<verse number="10">So, I no longer will show them any mercy nor give them one glance of pity. They hereby suffer the consequences of their own behavior.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Just then, the man dressed in white linen with the scribe’s case came back and made his report: “ It is finished; I have carried out your orders.”</verse>

				<verse number="1">Then I saw a vision. On top of the dome over the heads of the cherubim, I saw something that looked like a sapphire throne.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh said to the man dressed in white linen, “Go among the whirling wheels below the cherubim and take a handful of burning coals from between the living creatures and scatter them over the city.” While I was watching, he went in among the whirling wheels.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The cherubim were on the south side of the temple as the man went in, and the billowing glory cloud filled the inner courtyard.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The dazzling glory of Yahweh rose from between the cherubim and rested over the entrance of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the radiance of the glory of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The noise of the living creatures’ wings was as loud as the voice of God Almighty! The people could even hear it in the outer courtyard!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Afterward, Yahweh commanded the man dressed in white linen to go among the wheels and take fire that was burning among the cherubim. So, the man went among them and stood beside one of the wheels.</verse>
				<verse number="7">One of the living creatures then reached his hand into the fire between the cherubim and took some fire and placed it into the hands of the man dressed in white linen, who took it and left.</verse>
				<verse number="8">It seemed that the living creatures had what looked like a human hand under their wings.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I saw the four wheels by the living creatures, one wheel beside each living creature. And the wheels sparkled like precious gemstones.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Each wheel appeared to be identical with another wheel inside it.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As the wheels moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the living creatures faced, without having to turn around. They went in whatever direction their head faced without turning as they went.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Their entire bodies, their backs, their hands, their wings—along with all four of their wheels—were covered with eyes all around.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I heard a voice refer to the wheels as “whirling wheels.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Each living creature had four faces; the first was a cherub’s face, the second a human face, the third a lion’s face, and the fourth an eagle’s face.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the cherubim rose to the sky. They were the same living creatures I had seen by the River Chebar.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When the living creatures moved as a group in any direction, the wheels followed them, and when the living creatures levitated off the ground by spreading their wings, the wheels did not leave their place beside them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When the living creatures stopped, the wheels stopped; when the former rose, the wheels rose with them, since they shared the same living Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then the dazzling glory of Yahweh departed from the entrance of the temple and hovered over the living creatures.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They spread their wings, and before my eyes, I saw them levitate from the ground, with the wheels spinning beside them. Then they paused at the entrance to the eastern gate of Yahweh ’s temple, with the dazzling glory of the God of Israel shining over them.</verse>
				<verse number="20">These were the same living creatures I had seen beneath the throne of the God of Israel by the River Chebar; I knew that they were cherubim.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Each had four faces, four wings, and what appeared to be human hands under their wings.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Each one moved straight ahead. Their faces were identical to those I had seen by the River Chebar.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">God’s Spirit swept me off my feet and transported me to the eastern gate of the temple of Yahweh. And behold, there at the entrance to the gate facing east stood twenty-five men, including the two officials Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, these men are making evil plans to spread their wicked counsel throughout this city.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They say, ‘Isn’t it time to start building houses again? Jerusalem is like an iron storage pot, and we are like meat, stored safely away.’</verse>
				<verse number="4">Therefore, prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me, and said to me, “Tell the people: ‘I, Yahweh, say to the people of Israel, I know what you think, your every secret thought.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You have murdered so many people in this city that its streets are filled with corpses.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Therefore, Lord Yahweh says this: Yes, this city is the pot, and the corpses you have thrown into the streets, they are the meat! But I will drive you out of the city.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Are you afraid of the sword? Then I will bring the sword against you, declares the Lord Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And I will bring you to justice and will drive you out of Jerusalem and hand you over to foreigners!</verse>
				<verse number="10">I will judge you at the border of Israel and you will fall by the sword. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For this city will not be your safe storage pot, nor will you be the meat inside. I will execute justice on you on the border of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And then you will know that I am Yahweh, whose laws and commands you have disobeyed. Instead, you have embraced the customs of the neighboring nations.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="13">While I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah dropped dead. I threw myself facedown to the ground and cried out, “Oh no, Lord Yahweh, are you going to annihilate the remnant left in Israel?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yahweh spoke to me, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Son of man, the people living in Jerusalem are talking about you, your close relatives, and all the people of Israel. They are saying that the people in exile are away from Yahweh. ‘This country was given to us as our possession!’</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now give this message to your fellow exiles: ‘The Lord Yahweh says to you: Although I have sent you far away among the nations and I have scattered you to foreign countries, yet I have been your sanctuary for the time being wherever you have gone.’</verse>
				<verse number="17">And tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I will gather you back from the peoples, and draw you together from the countries where you have been scattered and give you the land of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When you return, you will purge the land of all its filthy idols and detestable practices.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I will give you a new, undivided heart, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will remove your stubborn heart of stone and give you a tender heart that responds to me—a devoted heart.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Therefore, you will keep my laws and faithfully obey my commands. Then you will truly be the people of my heart, and I will be the God you worship.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But I will punish those whose hearts are devoted to their filthy idols and detestable practices. I will repay them for their conduct, declares Lord Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then the cherubim raised their wings to fly, and the wheels moved in unison with them; above them was the radiant glory of the God of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And the glory of Yahweh went up from Jerusalem and stood above the mountain to the east of the city.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then, the Spirit snatched me away and transported me back among the exiles in Babylon. This was the vision given to me by the Spirit of God. Then the vision faded away.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And I told the exiles everything that Yahweh had revealed to me.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">The word of Yahweh was revealed to me:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, you are living among a rebellious people. They have eyes, but they will not see; they have ears, but they will not hear because they are bent on rebellion.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Therefore, son of man, pack a small bundle of your belongings and leave your home before nightfall. Let everyone see you go into exile. And go somewhere else, like you are a prisoner of war, while they watch you depart. Then perhaps they will understand that they are a rebellious people.</verse>
				<verse number="4">While everyone is watching, pack your things like a refugee’s bundle, by daylight, and leave like an exile at sunset.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Dig through the wall of your house and crawl out, carrying the bag with you. Make sure everyone is watching.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Let them watch as you shoulder your pack and go out into the dusk. And cover your face so that you cannot see the land you are leaving since I have made you a walking parable—a sign to warn the people of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So, I did as I had been told. I packed my bag like an exile’s bundle, by daylight. And that evening, I dug a hole through the wall with my hands. Then while everyone watched, I shouldered my pack and went out into the dark.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The next morning Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Son of man, did not the rebellious Israelites ask you, ‘What are you doing?’</verse>
				<verse number="10">Answer them with these words: ‘Lord Yahweh says to you that this prophetic oracle from God concerns the ruler in Jerusalem and all the people who live there.’</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Tell them, ‘I am a sign for you, for what I did is what is going to happen to them.’ They will be deported into exile.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Their ruler will shoulder his pack, and they will dig a hole in the wall to let him out at night. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land he is leaving.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I will throw my net over him and trap him in it. I will take him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans, where he will die without having seen it.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And I will scatter in every direction all his attendants, officials, and his armies, and I will chase after them with the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When I scatter them among different nations and peoples, they will recognize that I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But I will let a few of them escape the sword, plague, and food shortages. I will let them live so that they can describe all their terrible actions to the people in the lands where they will go. And they will recognize that I am Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then Yahweh spoke to me, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Son of man, eat your food with quaking and trembling. Shudder with fear as you drink your water.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Tell the people, ‘Lord Yahweh says this to the inhabitants of Jerusalem who remain in the land of Israel. They will tremble as they eat their food, and shake with fear when they drink their water because their enemies will strip the land bare on account of the violence of those who live there.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When your populous cities have been destroyed and the countryside has been deserted, then you will recognize that I am Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Son of man, what do you understand of the proverb you say among yourselves in the land of Israel, ‘Time goes by, and these visions never happen’?</verse>
				<verse number="23">Very well, tell them, ‘Lord Yahweh says this: I will put an end to this proverb, and it will never be repeated in Israel again.’ Tell them instead: ‘The time has arrived for every vision to come true,</verse>
				<verse number="24">for there will be no more false visions or deceptive prophecy among the people of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I, Yahweh, will speak the word, and what I say will come true without delay. For what I speak, I will accomplish in your own lifetime, you tribe of rebels. For I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Son of man, behold, the people of Israel are saying that your visions and prophecies are about the distant future, not today. They say, ‘He is prophesying of times in the distant future.’</verse>
				<verse number="28">So tell them, ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: There will be no more delay. My words will be fulfilled now! What I have prophesied will be done. Lord Yahweh has spoken!’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who claim to speak for me but are prophesying out of their own imagination. Say to them: ‘Listen, you lying prophets, to the words of Yahweh,</verse>
				<verse number="3">for the Lord Yahweh has a message for you. “ ‘Disaster is in store for the wicked prophets who make up their own visions, but they have seen and heard nothing!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Israel, your prophets have been like scavengers prowling among the city ruins.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They have not denounced the people’s sin or warned them of trouble coming so that Israel might stand up in battle on the day of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Their visions are phony and their prophecies of what is coming are lies. They say, “ Yahweh says,” when I, Yahweh, did not send them with my message, and yet they actually expect me to fulfill their words!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Have you not seen false visions and prophesied false prophecies of the future? You declare: “This is what Yahweh says,” when I had not spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“ ‘Therefore, Lord Yahweh says to you: Because you have spoken your false prophecies and lying visions, behold, I am against you, says Lord Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I will punish the false prophets who see false visions and speak lies about what they see coming in the future. They will no longer belong to my council of elders, nor will their names be inscribed in the register of the people of Israel, nor will they ever return to the land of Israel. And then the people will know for sure that I am Lord Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="10">“ ‘For in truth, they have gravely misled my people, saying, “Everything is fine,” when devastation is at hand. When the false build a “wall of words ” they cover it with the whitewash of their lies.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Prophesy to those who do so that their wall will fall! For I will send a stormy wind that will break loose with a deluge of rain and great hailstones.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And down will come the wall! When it crumbles, will not the people say to you, “Where’s that whitewashed wall of yours now?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“ ‘Therefore this is what I, Lord Yahweh, say to you: My anger will break forth as a windstorm and my wrath will break loose like a torrential rain, and I will send great hailstones to destroy your wall!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yes, I will level this plastered wall to the ground and lay bare its flimsy foundation. And when it crumbles, you, too, will crumble and perish. And then you will realize that I am Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="15">“ ‘For then my wrath will be spent against the wall and upon those who have smeared it with plaster. And I will say to you, “The wall is gone, and so are those who smeared plaster over it.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Those prophets of Israel who prophesied that Jerusalem would be fine, when devastation was near, will be no more!” For I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“As for you, son of man, prophesy against the women of your people, who are witches masquerading as prophets. For they prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them</verse>
				<verse number="18">and say, ‘Hear what Lord Yahweh says to you: You women are doomed who sew magic bands on their wrists and make veils of varying sizes for their heads in order to ensnare the lives of people, young and old. Do you think you can get away with entrapping the lives of my people and still preserve your own lives?</verse>
				<verse number="19">You have dishonored my name among my people for a few handfuls of barley and a few pieces of bread. You put to death people who should not have died and kept alive people who should not have lived, because you lied to my people, and they listened to your lies!</verse>
				<verse number="20">“ ‘Therefore I, Lord Yahweh, say to you: I am against your wristbands with which you ensnare people’s souls. I will tear them from your arms! And I will let your victims go free, those whom you hunt down like birds.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I will rip off your scarves and deliver my people from your hands. They will no longer be trapped by your power, and then you will know for sure that I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="22">By your lies you have made righteous people greatly discouraged (although I have not discouraged them). And by your lies you have encouraged the wicked not to repent from their wicked ways and save their lives.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Therefore you will no longer conjure up false visions or practice witchcraft. I will rescue my people from your deceptive power. And then you will know without a doubt that I am Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">One day, some leaders of Israel came to me to consult about what God was saying. While they were sitting there with me,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Son of man, these men have set up idols deep within their hearts. And they have set idols before their eyes, so why should I let them ask me anything?</verse>
				<verse number="4">So tell them this, ‘Lord Yahweh says: If any Israelite comes to consult with the prophet despite a heart that worships idols and eyes looking on that which leads into wickedness, I, Yahweh, will answer that person directly. I will give the answer that is deserved because of the great extent of the idolatry.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And in this way I hope to capture the hearts of the people of Israel who have all been estranged because of all their idols.’</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Therefore, prophesy to the people of Israel, ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: Repent! Come back to me and forsake your idols. Once and for all, turn your backs on all your detestable practices.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If any Israelite or a foreigner living among you rejects me with idolatry of the heart and has intentionally gazed on that which leads into wickedness, yet goes to consult with a prophet, then, I, Yahweh, will answer that person myself.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I will oppose that person! I will cut the idolator off from my people as an example and a warning to others. And then you will know that I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And if the prophet is tricked into speaking a prophetic word, it is I, Yahweh, who allowed this to happen, for I have decided to punish him with death.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Both the prophet and the one who consults him will be equally punished for their guilt.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I will do this so that they will never stray from me again or defile themselves with their rebellion. Then they will be my faithful people, and I will be their faithful God. For I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yahweh spoke to me, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Son of man, suppose all the people living in a certain country wander from me in pursuit of their sin, then I decide to come against them. I would punish them by destroying their food supply, inflicting famine on them, and causing people and animals to starve to death.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Even if the three godly men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, all lived there, their righteous lives could only save themselves—no one else. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Or suppose I unleash wild animals on that country to roam through the land killing its people, making the land so dangerous that no one would dare pass through it.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Even if these three godly men lived there, as surely as I, Lord Yahweh, am the living God, they would not be able to save even their own children. They alone would be spared, and the country would become a desert.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Or suppose I were to bring war upon that country, sending enemies with swords to devastate the land and wipe out both people and animals.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Even if these three godly men lived there, as surely as I, Lord Yahweh, am the living God, they would not be able to save either son or daughter; they alone would be saved.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Or suppose I were to send a pandemic on that country and pour out my wrath upon the people with a bloody death and wipe out both people and animals.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job lived there, as surely as I, Lord Yahweh, am the living God—their righteousness would only be able to save themselves and not even their own children.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Lord Yahweh spoke to me, saying, “How much worse it will be for Jerusalem when I send my four dreadful scourges—sword, famine, wild animals, and pandemic—to destroy both people and animals.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Even so, there will be a remnant left, a few who survive. Enemy soldiers will bring your wicked sons and daughters out of the city, and they will be brought here to Babylon. When you see them and realize how sinful are their ways and deeds, then you will not feel so sad when you understand that I, Yahweh, brought all these disasters upon Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="23">You will feel better when you see their evil way of life and actions, for then you will realize that I had a good reason to do what I did. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, how is the wood of the grapevine different than that of other tree branches of the forest?</verse>
				<verse number="3">Can its wood be used for making anything? Can it be used as pegs to hang things on?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Look, it is good only for building a fire. When fire burns off both ends and the middle is charred, is it useful for anything?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Even while it was intact, you could make nothing with it. When it’s burned and charred, it’s even more worthless.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So, Lord Yahweh says: “Just like I made the wood of the vine only useful as firewood, so I will treat the people of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will oppose them! They may have escaped one fire, but another fire will yet devour them. When I set my face against them, then you will know that I am Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Because of their unfaithfulness and infidelity, I will reduce the land to a desert. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke again to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, confront Jerusalem concerning all the despicable things they have done.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Tell them, ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: Your ancestral origins were in the land where the Canaanites lived. Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.</verse>
				<verse number="4">On the day you were born, there was no one there to cut your umbilical cord or wash you clean in water. There was no one there to rub you with salt and oil or wrap you in a baby blanket.</verse>
				<verse number="5">No one did anything to help you. No one felt sorry for you or showed sympathy for you. Instead, you were dumped into an open field and forgotten. From the day you were born you were rejected and unloved.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">“ ‘Then I passed by, and I saw you there squirming in your blood. And as you lay there covered with blood, I spoke over you: “Live!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">And I made you grow and flourish like the grass of the fields. You grew up and developed until you produced the most beautiful of features. You developed the breasts and hair of a young woman, but you were still quite naked and exposed.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then later, I passed by again and looked upon you. And behold, I saw that your time had come—you were now old enough for love. So, I spread the edge of my robe over you and covered your nakedness. I gave you my sacred oath. I, Lord Yahweh, made a divine covenant with you, saying, “You will be mine,” and I took you as my own and promised to care for you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then I washed the blood off you and anointed you with fragrant oil.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I dressed you in beautiful, embroidered gowns, fine leather shoes, a fine linen headband, and wrapped you in rich fabric.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I adorned you with jewels, beautiful bracelets, and necklaces.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I gave you a nose ring and earrings and placed a sparkling crown on your head.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You were decked with gold and silver jewelry and dressed in luxurious linen and rich embroidered cloth. Your meals were feasts, made with the best bread, honey, and oil. You grew more and more beautiful, and you rose to be queen.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And you became famous throughout the world because the splendor I lavished on you made your beauty perfect, declares Lord Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“ ‘But you became confident in your own beauty and used your fame to act like a prostitute. You offered your sexual favors to each one who came along—and you became his!</verse>
				<verse number="16">You took some of your fine clothes to decorate the tents on the high places where you worked as a prostitute.</verse>
				<verse number="17">You also took your gold and silver jewelry, which I had given you, and made yourself male images and acted like a prostitute with them.</verse>
				<verse number="18">You took your embroidered clothes and used these to dress them up, and you offered them my sacred oil and my sacred incense.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I gave you food made with the best flour, olive oil, and honey. But you offered it as a fragrant incense to these idols. I, Lord Yahweh, declare: that is exactly what you did!</verse>
				<verse number="20">You even took the sons and daughters I had given you and sacrificed them as food for the idols. As if your prostitution was not bad enough,</verse>
				<verse number="21">you slaughtered my children and burned them as offerings to idols!</verse>
				<verse number="22">While you were doing the things I hate and behaving like a prostitute, you entirely forgot how you were when you were young. I found you naked and exposed, squirming in your own blood.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“ ‘Now I, Lord Yahweh, say you are doomed! Not only did you do these evil things,</verse>
				<verse number="24">in every city square you built an elevated shrine for the worship of idols.</verse>
				<verse number="25">At the entry to every alley you put up your brothel and dragged your beauty through the mud. You spread your legs to all who passed by in countless acts of prostitution.</verse>
				<verse number="26">You slept with your well-endowed neighbors, the Egyptians, provoking my anger with your lifestyle of a prostitute.</verse>
				<verse number="27">So listen, I have taken action to punish you and remove your portion of my blessing. I have put you at the mercy of your enemies, the Philistine women, who blushed over your lewd behavior.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Still unsatisfied, you prostituted yourself to the Assyrians and played the harlot with them. But even then, you were not satisfied.</verse>
				<verse number="29">You committed further acts of fornication with the Babylonians, that nation of merchants, but that still did not satisfy you.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="30">“ ‘I, Lord Yahweh, say: You make me extremely angry because of all these things that you have done. You have acted like a brazen prostitute who has no shame.</verse>
				<verse number="31">You built an elevated shrine on every street to worship idols, put up your pavilion in every public square. But you are not like a common prostitute just out for the money.</verse>
				<verse number="32">You are an adulterous wife who would rather have sex with strangers than her husband.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Men will pay a prostitute, but you give presents to all your lovers! You bribe them to come from everywhere just to sleep with you.</verse>
				<verse number="34">You are so different from other prostitutes. No one came to ask you for sex. The men you slept with did not pay you, but you paid them. Therefore, you are worse than a prostitute!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="35">“ ‘Very well, Jerusalem, you whore! Hear the word of Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="36">Lord Yahweh says to you: You poured out your lust and are ready for sex. As a prostitute, you uncovered your genitals for your lovers and for all those disgusting idols. You killed your children to honor those false gods.</verse>
				<verse number="37">“ ‘Behold, I will bring together all your lovers to whom you gave pleasure—all those you loved and all those you hated. Yes, I will bring them from everywhere, and I will strip you naked in front of them and let them see your genitals.</verse>
				<verse number="38">“ ‘I will judge you with the same death sentence of an adulterer or murderer and bring upon you the fury of my burning rage.</verse>
				<verse number="39">I will hand you over to your “lovers,” and they will destroy your elevated chamber and pull down your sacred shrines. They will strip you of your clothes, take away your lovely jewels, and leave you stark naked.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Then they will gather an angry mob against you who will stone you to death and hack you to pieces with their swords.</verse>
				<verse number="41">They will burn down your homes and execute justice on you while many other women look on. I will once and for all put an end to your wicked harlotry—no more paid lovers for you!</verse>
				<verse number="42">“ ‘Once my fury is exhausted with you, I will calm down and let my anger die away. Then I will not be angry anymore.</verse>
				<verse number="43">You have entirely forgotten how I treated you when you were young. And you have done nothing but provoke me, so now I, in turn, will cause you to suffer the consequences for your own behavior. And haven’t you committed such gross lewdness in addition to all your other shocking sins? I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="44">Yahweh says, “Behold, all who quote proverbs will surely apply this proverb to you, Jerusalem: Like mother, like daughter.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Yes; you are a daughter exactly like your pagan mother, who hated her husband and her children. And you have become exactly like your sisters, who hated their husbands and their children. You and your sister cities had a Hittite mother and an Amorite father.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Your big sister is Samaria with her daughter- villages to the north of you. Your little sister is Sodom with her daughter- villages to the south of you.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Yet you were not satisfied to live as the people of Samaria and Sodom lived, copying all their wicked ways and imitating their loathsome practices. In very little time, you became more wicked than they were in all your ways.</verse>
				<verse number="48">As surely as I, Lord Yahweh, live, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did the evil that you and your daughters have done.</verse>
				<verse number="49">Behold, the guilt of your sister Sodom! She and her daughters were arrogant, gluttonous, and lived in carefree complacency. They never thought to help the poor and needy.</verse>
				<verse number="50">They were proud, stubborn, and defiantly evil before me, and so I swept them away as you have seen.</verse>
				<verse number="51">And yet Samaria never committed half the sins that you have. You have done more detestable things than they. When compared to all your gross practices, you have made your sisters seem innocent!</verse>
				<verse number="52">So now you will bear the shame of your deeds, which provides a measure of justification for your sisters, since your sins are viler than theirs. They now appear more upright than you are. So, suffer the utter disgrace and humiliation of having made your sisters appear more righteous than you!</verse>
				<verse number="53">“I will restore their fortunes; I will restore Sodom and her daughters. I will restore Samaria and her daughters, and then I will also restore your fortunes along with them.</verse>
				<verse number="54">You will be totally ashamed of yourself and bear disgrace for all you have done in giving them comfort.</verse>
				<verse number="55">When your sisters, Sodom and her daughter-villages and Samaria and her daughter-villages, are restored to what they were, then you, too, and your surrounding villages will be restored to what you were.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Jerusalem, did you not gloat in your pride over your sister Sodom</verse>
				<verse number="57">before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you are just like her! You have become the laughingstock of the Philistines, the Syrians, and all your neighbors who hate you and heap scorn on you.</verse>
				<verse number="58">You have brought this on yourself with your lewdness and your disgusting deeds. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="59">“For I, Lord Yahweh say to you: I will treat you as you deserve, for you have broken your marriage covenant and despised your promises to me.</verse>
				<verse number="60">But I will remember my covenant that I made with you in the days of your youth. I will renew that covenant with you, and it will last forever.</verse>
				<verse number="61">When you get back your older and younger sisters, then you will remember your ways and feel ashamed. I will make them like daughters to you, but not on the basis of my new covenant with you.</verse>
				<verse number="62">Yes, I will graciously renew my covenant with you, and then you will know me as Yahweh -God.</verse>
				<verse number="63">You may remember your wretched past and feel deep remorse, yet you will be reduced to silence when you realize that I have forgiven you for everything you have done. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>

			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, propose this riddle to Israel, and speak this parable to the people.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Tell them to guess the meaning of what I, Yahweh, have to say to them: “There once was this great eagle with huge wings, whose wingspan was very wide, with many beautiful colored feathers around its head. One day he came to the Lebanon Mountains, and taking a new branch of a cedar tree,</verse>
				<verse number="4">he broke it off and carried it off to a land of traders. He planted it there in a city of merchants.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Next, he took a young seedling from the land and planted it in a fertile field. He placed it like a willow tree by the side of a flowing stream.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The young plant sprouted until it became a low spreading vine. Its branches grew up toward the great eagle, and its roots grew down deep into the soil. So, it became a vine, branching out and sprouting new shoots.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But another great eagle appeared with huge wings and many feathers around its head. And soon the vine bent its roots toward him and stretched its branches toward this eagle from the place where it was planted, expecting this eagle to nourish it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The vine was planted in good soil, by the side of a generous stream so that the vine could branch out, bear fruit, and become a wonderful vine.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So I, Lord Yahweh, ask you: Will the vine thrive? Will not the first eagle come and tear out its roots? Will it not strip off its grapes so that all its foliage withers? Then, even weak ones could easily uproot it!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yes, it is planted—but will it thrive? Will it not shrivel up when the east wind blows? Will it not wither in the fertile soil where it had grown?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Ask that tribe of rebels if they know the meaning of my parable. Tell them: ‘Listen, the king of Babylon swooped into Jerusalem. Then he carried away the king and top officials and took them off to Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He took one from the royal family and made a treaty with him, forcing him to swear an oath of allegiance to him. He also carried off to Babylon the leading men of Israel</verse>
				<verse number="14">so that their kingdom would be humbled and not rise again and to ensure that the treaty would be kept.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar and sent envoys to Egypt to procure himself horses and a large army. Will he get away with that? Will a man who has done this go unpunished? Will he break the treaty and still escape?</verse>
				<verse number="16">As surely as I, Lord Yahweh, live, this king will die in Babylon! He will die in the country of the king who put him on the throne, because he despised his oath and broke the treaty he had made.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Despite Pharaoh’s mighty army and numerous troops, he will not be able to save him in war. When the Babylonians build siege ramps and wooden towers to kill many in the city, the Egyptians will not lift a finger to help!</verse>
				<verse number="18">For he despised his oath by breaking the treaty to which he had pledged himself, and he will not go unpunished.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“ ‘Therefore, I, Lord Yahweh, decree, as surely as I live, I swear it. It was my oath that he has despised and my treaty which he has broken. I will punish him for this!</verse>
				<verse number="20">I will throw my net over him and trap him in it. I will take him to Babylon and render judgment against him there for all the wicked things he did against me.</verse>
				<verse number="21">All his elite troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered in every direction. And then you will know that I, Yahweh, have decreed it.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Lord Yahweh says: “I will take the highest branch from a cedar tree. I will break off from the very top a tender shoot and plant it myself on a high and lofty mountain.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I will plant it on the highest mountain in Israel, where it will put out branches and bear fruit and grow into a stately cedar tree. Every kind of bird will find a home in it. Yes, in the shade of its branches the birds will make their nests.</verse>
				<verse number="24">And all the trees of the field will know that I, Yahweh, am the one who brings the tall tree low and raises the low tree high, who withers the green tree and makes the withered tree sprout again. I, Yahweh, have spoken and have done it!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Why do you keep repeating this proverb in the land of Israel: “The parents have eaten sour grapes, but the children are the ones with the sour taste in their mouths?</verse>
				<verse number="3">“As I, Lord Yahweh, live, you will have no reason to repeat this proverb in Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Listen, every human life belongs to me; both the parent and the child are mine. The one who sins is held responsible and will die.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Suppose a man is morally good, and his actions are righteous and honest.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He does not take part in the heathen feasts on the mountains nor worship the false gods of the people of Israel. He does not commit adultery nor have sex with a woman during her period.</verse>
				<verse number="7">He exploits and defrauds no one. He does not steal but generously feeds the hungry and clothes the needy.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He does not lend at interest or take any profit. He refuses to do anything evil and gives honest judgment between one person and another.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He keeps my laws and is honest in all that he does. A person like this is righteous, and he will certainly live. I, Lord Yahweh, have decreed it.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“But suppose he has a son who is prone to violence and bloodshed,</verse>
				<verse number="11">doing what his father never did. He takes part in the heathen feasts on the mountains, commits adultery,</verse>
				<verse number="12">exploits the poor and needy, robs, and defrauds others. He worships the false gods and engages in despicable practices</verse>
				<verse number="13">and charges exorbitant interest for profit when lending money—such a person will by no means live. Because he committed all these appalling deeds, he will surely be put to death, and he alone will be responsible for his own death.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“But suppose this evil man has a son who sees all the sins his father practiced, yet chooses not to follow his poor example</verse>
				<verse number="15">and refuses to take part in the heathen feasts on the mountains or worship the false gods of the people of Israel. He does not seduce another man’s wife,</verse>
				<verse number="16">nor exploit nor defraud anyone. He does not steal but feeds the hungry and clothes the needy.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He refuses to do anything evil and does not lend for profit or charge exorbitant interest. He faithfully keeps my laws and teachings—such a person will certainly live and not die for his father’s sins.</verse>
				<verse number="18">As for his father, because he practiced fraud, cheated, and robbed others, doing what is wrong among his people, he will most certainly die in his guilt.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Yet you ask, ‘Why doesn’t the child bear his father’s guilt?’ If a person lives an honest and upright life and keeps my laws and faithfully follows my teachings, he will most certainly live.</verse>
				<verse number="20">It is the one who sins who will die. A child is not to bear his father’s guilt nor a father his child’s guilt. Good people will be credited for their own righteousness and the wicked with his own wickedness.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">“However, if the wicked man renounces all the sins he has committed, obeys my laws, and does what is fair and upright, he will most certainly live and will not die.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I will not remember any of the sins he committed in the past. Because he has done what is right, he will most certainly live.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I, Lord Yahweh, say: Do you think I enjoy seeing the wicked die? I would much rather see him renounce his sins and live!</verse>
				<verse number="24">“However, if the righteous man abandons his righteous ways and acts wickedly, and follows all the despicable practices of the wicked, should he be allowed to live? None of his righteous deeds will be remembered from then on, for he is guilty of being unfaithful to me, and he will most certainly die.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“But you complain, ‘The Lord is being unfair. That’s not right.’ Now people of Israel, listen to me: Do you think my way of doing things is unjust? Aren’t you the ones who are acting unjustly?</verse>
				<verse number="26">When the righteous man abandons his righteous ways, does what is evil, and dies, he dies responsible for the wrong that he himself committed.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Similarly, when the wicked man abandons his wicked ways to do what is good and right, he saves his own life.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Having considered his ways and having chosen to renounce all his former sins, he will most certainly live and not die.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And yet the people of Israel say, ‘What the Lord does is not just.’ Really? What I do is not just, people of Israel? Aren’t you the ones who are acting unjustly?</verse>
				<verse number="30">So from here on, you people of Israel, I, Lord Yahweh, say to you: I will judge each of you by what he does. Repent, turn away from all your sins, or your own wickedness will be your downfall.</verse>
				<verse number="31">You must get rid of all the guilty sins you have committed and clothe yourselves with a new heart and a new spirit. People of Israel, choose life!</verse>
				<verse number="32">I find no pleasure watching anyone die, so repent and live! I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">“Now Ezekiel, sing this funeral song to mourn the rulers of Israel,</verse>
				<verse number="2">saying, “ ‘What a lioness was your mother among lions! She lay down among the young lions and reared her cubs.</verse>
				<verse number="3">One of the cubs she raised grew into a young and powerful man-eating lion who learned to hunt and devour his prey.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The nations heard about him, and they trapped him in their pit. With hooks they dragged him off to Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When she realized that he was not coming back, she despaired and her hopes were dashed. She chose another of her cubs to take his place and made a powerful lion of him too.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He prowled among the pride and grew into a powerful man-eating lion, who learned to hunt and devour his prey.</verse>
				<verse number="7">He demolished their strongholds and destroyed their cities. Whenever the lion released his roar, the land and all the people were terrified!</verse>
				<verse number="8">The nations marched out against him from all around. They threw their net over him, and he was trapped in their pit.</verse>
				<verse number="9">With their hooks they captured him, led him with bands around his neck to the king of Babylon. They threw him into a dungeon so that his roar could never be heard again on the mountains of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“ ‘Your mother was like a grapevine planted beside a stream, with luscious fruit and full of branches, because the water flowed so abundantly.</verse>
				<verse number="11">She grew strong branches, and some grew very high, which became royal scepters. The vine grew higher and higher, up into the clouds. Everyone could see her towering height and the vast number of her branches.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But disaster struck the vine. Angry, mighty hands pulled it up by its roots and threw it to the ground. The hot east wind dried it up, and her fruit shriveled and fell to the ground. Her strong stem was withered and was consumed by the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now what remains of her has been transplanted to the desert, to a dry and thirsty land.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Fire spread from her stem and devoured its fruit. There is not a strong branch left that could become a scepter for a king.’ ” This is a funeral song of lament, and it should be used as such.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">It was the seventh year, the fifth month, and the tenth day after our deportation to Babylon. Some of the elders of Israel came to request that I ask Yahweh for his message to them. As we sat together,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Son of man, give the elders of Israel this message: ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: Are you really coming to consult with me? As surely as I live, I will tell you nothing. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then he said to me, “Judge them, Ezekiel! Bring a charge against them, son of man! Confront them over the disgusting practices of their ancestors!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Tell them what I, Lord Yahweh, say: ‘On the day when I chose Israel to be my people, I pledged my word to the tribes of Jacob, and I revealed myself to them in Egypt. I pledged my word to them and said: I am Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">That day I promised that I would bring them out of Egypt to a land I had searched out especially for them—a land flowing with milk and honey, the most splendid land of all.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And I said to them, “Every one of you, get rid of the things you love that I hate. Don’t make yourselves unfit for my presence by worshiping the idols of Egypt. For I am Yahweh your God.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But they rebelled against me and refused to listen to me. Not one of them rejected the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they give up the idols of Egypt. So in my anger, I decided to pour out my wrath on them and vent my anger against them in the midst of Egypt.’</verse>
				<verse number="9">I acted to protect the honor of my name, so that I would not be profaned in the eyes of the surrounding nations who saw me reveal myself by bringing the Israelites out of Egypt.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“So I brought them out of Egypt and led them into the desert.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I gave them my laws and taught them my commands, so that they would follow them and live by them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And I also gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between me and them so that they might know that I, Yahweh, am the one who sets them apart as my own.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But the Israelites rebelled against me in the wilderness and refused to keep my laws and rejected my commands (the one who obeys my laws will live by them), and they completely dishonored my Sabbaths. I was about to vent my fury on them in the desert and destroy them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But I chose to withhold my punishment for the sake of my holy name, that it not be profaned in the eyes of the nations who had seen my power in bringing the Israelites out of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So, I made a vow in the desert that I would not bring that generation into the most splendid land that I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For they had scorned my commands, refused to keep my laws, dishonored my Sabbaths, and their hearts were attached to idols.</verse>
				<verse number="17">In spite of this, I took pity on them, so I spared them from destruction and did not make an end of them in the desert.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“I warned their children in the wilderness: ‘Do not follow the ways of your ancestors, do not practice their standard of justice, and do not defile yourselves with their foul idols.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I am Yahweh your God. Keep my laws, obey my commands, and follow them.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Keep my Sabbaths as holy days. Let them be a covenant -sign between me and you, to remind you that I am Yahweh your God.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">“However, like their parents, the next generation rebelled against me; they refused to keep my laws and did not respect or practice my standard of justice so that they would follow my laws and live by them. They also dishonored my Sabbaths. So, in my fury I decided to punish them and pour out my anger on them in the desert.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But I restrained myself to protect the honor of my name so that I would not be profaned in the eyes of the surrounding nations who saw me reveal myself by bringing the Israelites out of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Moreover, I made a vow to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them throughout the nations and disperse them into foreign countries.</verse>
				<verse number="24">I did this because they had broken my laws, refused to obey my commands, dishonored my Sabbaths, and their hearts chased after the idols of their ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And for this reason I gave them laws and regulations that resulted in punishment, not life.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And because they sacrificed their firstborn children in the fire, I declared them defiled and unfit to worship me. I did this to fill them with revulsion so that they would know that I am Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Therefore, son of man, speak to the people of Israel in exile and say to them, ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: Here is another instance of your ancestors blaspheming me by their infidelity.</verse>
				<verse number="28">When I had brought them into the promised land, they discovered all sorts of high hills and all kinds of spreading trees. That is where they offered sacrifices and made offerings to false gods that provoked my anger. That is where they burned incense and poured out drink offerings to false gods.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So I asked them: What is this high place where you go?’ ” (So its name is called High Place to this day.)</verse>
				<verse number="30">“Say to the Israelites in exile, ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: Will you defile yourselves in the same way your ancestors did and act like a prostitute with your idol worship?</verse>
				<verse number="31">For when you offer your gifts and sacrifice your children as sacrifices by fire, you defile yourselves with all your idol worship to this very day. Do you think you can come and consult with me? As surely as I live, I will not answer you. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken!</verse>
				<verse number="32">“ ‘You are saying that you want to worship idols of wood and stone and be like the nations around you. But what you have in mind will never happen.</verse>
				<verse number="33">As surely as I, Lord Yahweh, live, I warn you: I will continue to rule over you with a strong hand and with all my power and my wrath poured out!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="34">“ ‘You have been scattered into many different nations and lands. But with a strong hand and my mighty power and outpoured wrath, I will bring you back.</verse>
				<verse number="35">I will bring you into the desert of many nations, and there I will enter into judgment with you face-to-face!</verse>
				<verse number="36">Just as I entered into judgment with your ancestors in the wilderness of Sinai, so I now judge you. I am Lord Yahweh, and I declare this to you.</verse>
				<verse number="37">I will make you pass under the shepherd’s rod and take note of you, as a shepherd sorts his sheep. And I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="38">I will purge out the rebels from among you, those who sin against me. I will remove them from the land where they are exiled, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="39">And now, you people of Israel, Lord Yahweh says: Go ahead, all of you, worship your foul idols, if that’s what you want to do. But later you will have to listen and obey me! Then you will no longer dishonor my holy name by worshiping your foul idols and bringing your offerings to them.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="40">“ ‘Lord Yahweh says: On the high mountain of Israel set apart for me, all the people of Israel—everyone in the land—will worship me. I will be pleased with you and accept your sacrifices to me. And there I will require your best offerings, all your best gifts dedicated to me, and your holy sacrifices.</verse>
				<verse number="41">I will take you out from among the nations and lands where you have been scattered and gather you together. Then I will be pleased with you just as I am pleased with the sweet aroma of burning sacrifices. And I will put my holiness on display through you before the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="42">And when I bring you back to the soil of Israel, the land that I pledged my word to give to your ancestors, you will know that I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="43">You will remember your ways and all the vile actions by which you have defiled yourselves, and you will be disgusted with yourselves for all the evil things you did.</verse>
				<verse number="44">And when I deal with you, not as you deserve because of your wickedness, but in a way that brings honor to my name, then you, the people of Israel, will recognize that I am God. I, Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="45">Then Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="46">“Son of man, look toward the south and prophesy against the forests of the southern land.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Prophesy to the southern forest, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh: Behold, I, Lord Yahweh, say to you that I am about to light a fire in you that will consume every green tree and every dry tree of your land! This blazing fire will not be extinguished as it spreads to the north and consumes everything in its path.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Everyone will know that it was I, Yahweh, who started that fire, and no one will ever be able to put it out.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="49">But I protested and said, “But Lord Yahweh, everyone is already complaining that I only speak in riddles.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, turn toward Jerusalem and denounce her place of worship. Prophesy against the land of Israel</verse>
				<verse number="3">and say to the people, ‘ Yahweh says to you: I am your enemy, and I am about to draw my sword and destroy the good and evil alike.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I am going to use my drawn sword to cut off the upright and wicked alike, everyone alive from the south to the north.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then everyone will know that I, Yahweh, am the one who has unsheathed my sword, and I will not put it back again!’</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Son of man, groan with bitter grief before their eyes. Groan as though your heart is breaking with sorrow.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And when they ask, ‘Why these groans?’ reply, ‘Because of what I’ve heard is about to happen. Every heart will melt with fear, and every hand grow limp. Everyone will faint with fright and wet themselves. Behold, it is coming now! It is here!’ I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Son of man, prophesy the message that I, the Lord, give you: “A sword, a sword of judgment has been sharpened and polished,</verse>
				<verse number="10">sharpened for a great slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! Should we rejoice in the dynasty of my son, Judah? No! The sword despises every such stick.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I handed over the sword for someone to polish so he can use it, sharp, shiny, and ready for the hand of the executioner.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Shout and wail, son of man, for the sword will come against my people, and all the leaders of Israel. They are thrown to the sword like the rest of my people. So beat your breast in anguish,</verse>
				<verse number="13">for surely, I am testing my people. What if the scepter of Judah, despised by the sword, does not survive? I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“So prophesy, son of man, and strike hand to hand in anger! Let the sword strike twice, even three times. For the sword is prepared for those to be slain, a mighty sword to terrify, with a great slaughter from every side!</verse>
				<verse number="15">This sword will make them stumble and fall, and their hearts will melt with fear. I have posted the threatening sword at every gate to flash like lightning, polished for the slaughter.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Slash to the right, and ready on the left, whichever way your blade turns!</verse>
				<verse number="17">I also will strike hand to hand in anger and satisfy my fury! I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Yahweh said to me:</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Son of man, mark out two roads for the king of Babylon to come with his sword; both should originate from the same land. Then put up a signpost at the place where the road branches off to the city.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Mark out the routes for the sword to come to Rabbah-of-the-Ammonites, and to Judah, and its fortress of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For the king of Babylon is already at the place where the two roads begin. He is consulting his gods to decide which way to go by shuffling arrows and throwing them on the ground to see where they point. He asks his favorite idols for advice, and he examines the liver of a sacrificed animal.</verse>
				<verse number="22">It tells him to take the road on the right leading to Jerusalem, so the king decides to go there. His plan is to ready the battering rams to be prepared when he gives the order for slaughter. His army will shout the battle cry and set up the battering rams against the gates. They will make siege ramps and construct siege towers.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“The people of Jerusalem will believe that these omens are false, for they have made sworn treaties and think they are safe. But Nebuchadnezzar’s decision to attack will remind them of their sins against God, and as a result, they will be captured.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Therefore, Lord Yahweh says, ‘You have uncovered your waywardness by parading all your evil deeds. You flaunt your sins in everything you do. Because of this, your enemies will capture you by force!</verse>
				<verse number="25">“ ‘As for you, wicked and unholy prince of Israel, Lord Yahweh has a message for you. Your doom is approaching. Your time is up, and I will put an end to your crimes. Take off your royal turban and remove your crown. Everything is about to be turned upside down. Lowly ones will be raised up, and those who seem important now will become nobodies.</verse>
				<verse number="26"></verse>
				<verse number="27">A ruin, a ruin, I will make this city a ruin —until the one arrives, the rightful ruler. Then I will hand him the crown to rule.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Son of man, prophesy and announce what I, Lord Yahweh, say to the mocking Ammonites: ‘A sword, a sword is drawn and ready for slaughter! It is a sharp, polished sword to flash like lightning and to destroy.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The visions you had are false. When you consulted your gods about what would happen, their answers were lies. Your day of judgment has come! It’s high time for your punishment to reach its climax. The sword is going to cut off your heads!</verse>
				<verse number="30">“ ‘Put the sword back in its scabbard. I will punish you in the land where you were born, the land of your origin.</verse>
				<verse number="31">I will vent my fury on you, blow the fire of my rage against you, and hand you over to brutal men whose skill is destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="32">You will be fuel for the fire. Babylonian blood will flow in your homeland, and no one will remember anything about you. I, Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me again and said,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, are you ready to judge the city of murderers? You must confront her with all the disgusting things she has done!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Prophesy to the city what I, Lord Yahweh, say to them: ‘Jerusalem, you bring doom upon yourselves because you have shed the blood of so many. You are defiled by your man-made gods.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You have become guilty by the blood you have shed and defiled by your hand-made gods. Your time is up! Your day of reckoning is on the way. Therefore, I have made you an object of scorn and a laughingstock to all the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Nations near and far will taunt you, O infamous city, full of turmoil.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“ ‘Behold! The leaders of Israel within your walls, one and all, have selfishly abused their power to shed blood.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They have despised their fathers and mothers, cheated the foreigners who live within your walls, and mistreated the widow and orphan.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All that I call holy, you have treated with contempt. You have dishonored my Sabbaths.</verse>
				<verse number="9">In your city are those who slander in order to have someone murdered. Living among you are those who eat food sacrificed to false gods in mountain shrines and commit obscene acts.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Your men have sex with their father’s wives. They force themselves on women who are having their periods and are ceremonially unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="11">In your city a man commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife, and another man seduces his daughter-in-law or sister, his own father’s daughter.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Some of your people will murder for pay. Some extort their neighbors with threats of violence, charging them exorbitant interest for obscene profits, yet they have entirely forgotten about me! I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“ ‘Now I will bring my fists down on your acts of robbery and murder in your midst!</verse>

				<verse number="16">Because of your own actions, you will be grossly defiled in the sight of the nations, and then you will understand and realize that I am Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Son of man, for me, the people of Israel have become worthless dross. They all have become like the useless byproduct of refined silver, bronze, tin, iron, lead, all mixed up together and left in the smelter; they are dross.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Therefore, I, Lord Yahweh, say to the people of Jerusalem, ‘Since you have all become worthless dross, leftover metal, I will collect you inside Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Just as the metalsmith collects silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin in the furnace, and the fire is fanned underneath to melt them down, so I will collect you there and melt you down in my furious anger.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I will put you all in the furnace and fan the fire of my rage to burn against you. I will melt you there in the middle of the furnace.</verse>
				<verse number="22">As silver is refined in the smelter, so you will be melted down inside the city, and you will understand and recognize that I, Yahweh, have vented my fury against you.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Yahweh spoke to me again and said:</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Son of man, say to Israel, ‘You are a land that has had no shower nor cleansing rain on the day of my anger.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Your prophets plot conspiracies as lions stalk their prey. They have devoured the people, enriched themselves by seizing their wealth and jewels, and left behind many widows.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Her priests have violated my law and have no respect for what is holy. They have made no distinction between what is holy and what is common. They have not taught people the difference between clean and unclean; they ignore my Sabbaths, and I have been defiled among them.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Within the land are leaders who are like a pack of wolves who rip apart their prey, shed blood, and kill people to get money dishonestly.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Her false prophets have plastered over these things with their empty visions and false prophecies, saying: “ Yahweh says this,” even though I, Yahweh, have not spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The people of the land have practiced extortion and robbery! They have oppressed the poor and needy and mistreated the foreigner among them who have no way of getting justice.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="30">“I searched for someone who would repair the wall, one who fills the gap, an intercessor to cry out for mercy, but I found no one. There was no one found who would keep my justice from destroying the nation.</verse>
				<verse number="31">So I will pour out my fury on them, and like a fire I will destroy them. I will punish them for the evil they have done. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="23">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, there once were two women, daughters of the same mother.</verse>
				<verse number="3">While they were still girls, they became prostitutes in Egypt. Men caressed their breasts; their virgin breasts were first fondled there.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Oholah (Samaria) was the older and Oholibah (Jerusalem) her younger sister. I married them both, and they bore me sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Although Oholah was mine, she continued her prostitution. She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians—warriors</verse>
				<verse number="6">wearing uniforms of purple, governors, and officials. All of them were young and handsome and skilled horsemen.</verse>
				<verse number="7">She was a prostitute for all the most important men of Assyria. She made herself unfit for my presence by worshiping all the idols of every man she had sex with.</verse>
				<verse number="8">When she was a girl in Egypt, men fondled her breasts and made love to her often, pouring their lust upon her repeatedly. She did not give up her prostitution.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“So I handed her over to the power of her lovers, to the Assyrians whom she lusted after.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They stripped her naked, seized her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword. She became notorious among women because of her punishment for her sins.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Her sister Oholibah saw all this, but she was even more depraved and a wilder prostitute than her sister.</verse>
				<verse number="12">She lusted after the Assyrians—warriors dressed to perfection, governors, and officials. All of them were young and handsome and skilled horsemen.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then I saw that she was completely immoral; both sisters were equally corrupt.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But Oholibah sank ever deeper into unrestrained sexual immorality, worse than ever. She saw the wall carvings of the Babylonian men, painted bright red, the images of the elite men of Babylon (natives of Chaldea), and her lust was enflamed even more. The men looked magnificent, like officers going into battle on their horses! They were the high-ranking Babylonian chariot officers with beautiful sashes tied around their waists and elaborate turbans on their heads.</verse>
				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16">As soon as she saw them, she went wild with lust and sent messengers to them in Babylon to come and have sex with her.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The Babylonians came to her, shared her love-bed, and defiled her with their lust. Once they had defiled her, she withdrew her affection and turned her back on them.</verse>
				<verse number="18">She exposed her naked body to everyone and showed them openly that she was a prostitute. Therefore, I turned my back on her just as I had done with her sister.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yet she began sinking even deeper into her depraved sexual immorality, acting the way she did when she was a young prostitute in Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="20">She was driven by insatiable lust for Egyptian men, with genitals as large as donkeys’, ejaculating as forcefully as stallions.</verse>
				<verse number="21">In that way, you were longing to repeat the debauchery of your youth, when men used to fondle your nipples in Egypt and played with your young breasts.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">“And so, Oholibah, Lord Yahweh says to you: ‘Behold, I will stir up all your former lovers against you, from whom you have withdrawn your affection. I will bring them against you from every side:</verse>
				<verse number="23">the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, men of Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, young and handsome men, all governors, officials, and warriors—all of them skillful horsemen.</verse>
				<verse number="24">They will attack you from the north and advance on you with chariots, wagons, and troops, setting themselves against you on all sides with shields and helmets. I will commit to them the right to judge you, and they will pass sentence on you as they see fit.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I will direct my fiery indignation against you and let them treat you with fury. They will slice off your nose and ears, and what is left of your people will fall by the sword. They will capture your surviving sons and daughters and burn them alive.</verse>
				<verse number="26">They will strip off your clothes and rob you of your fine jewels.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“ ‘So I will put a stop to your debauchery and the habitual prostitution you began in Egypt. You will not view the Egyptians as your lovers anymore. You will never think of them again.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For Lord Yahweh says: Now, I will hand you over to those you hate, those for whom you no longer feel affection.</verse>
				<verse number="29">They will treat you with hatred, strip you of all that you have worked hard for, and leave you stark naked. Just as you were naked in your prostitution, so you will be naked when everyone discovers your debauchery and habitual prostitution!</verse>
				<verse number="30">You have brought all this on yourself because you have played the whore with the nations and have made yourself unfit for my presence by worshiping their idols.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Since you have followed your sister’s footsteps, I will put her cup of punishment in your hands to drink.</verse>
				<verse number="32">The Lord Yahweh says to you: “ ‘You will drink of the same cup as your sister, a large cup both deep and wide that contains much sorrow! Drink it all, for it will lead to mockery and insults!</verse>
				<verse number="33">You will be drunk with misery and sorrow. It is a cup of horror and devastation, the cup of your sister Samaria.</verse>
				<verse number="34">You will drain it dry. Then, in despair, you will smash the cup in pieces, gnaw on the shattered shards, and cut off your own breasts, once fondled by others. For I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="35">“ ‘And so, Lord Yahweh says: Because you have forgotten me and have turned your back on me, you too will have to bear the consequences of your outrageous, depraved sexual immorality.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="36">And Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, are you ready to render judgment upon Oholah and Oholibah and charge them with their detestable practices?</verse>
				<verse number="37">They have been wicked adulteresses. Their hands are dripping with blood, and they have committed gross adultery with their vile images. They have even committed murder by offering up their children, who are mine, as burnt sacrifices to feed their false gods!</verse>
				<verse number="38">Moreover, they have sinned against me by defiling my sanctuary and dishonoring my Sabbaths.</verse>
				<verse number="39">The same day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they came into my sanctuary and made it unfit for worship. Yes, this is what they have done in my own house!</verse>
				<verse number="40">“Worse still, they sent messengers to summon men from far away to come have sex with them, and they came. To meet your lovers you bathed yourselves, painted your eyes, put on your provocative clothes with your finest jewelry.</verse>
				<verse number="41">You reclined on your sumptuous couch with a table spread before you with my aromatic incense and oils.</verse>
				<verse number="42">The noise of your party, a carefree crowd, echoed all around— a noisy crowd of drunk nomads! They put bracelets on the women’s arms and magnificent headpieces on their heads.</verse>
				<verse number="43">I thought, ‘Isn’t that woman worn out with her adultery? Let them use her as a prostitute—she’s a professional.’</verse>
				<verse number="44">“Yet the men continued to have sex with her as one does with a prostitute, just as they slept with Oholah and Oholibah—those lewd women!</verse>
				<verse number="45">But there are righteous men who will declare them guilty of adultery and murder. For they are, indeed, adulteresses and their hands are stained with blood.”</verse>
				<verse number="46">Lord Yahweh says: “Gather a mob to deal with them, to rob and terrorize them!</verse>
				<verse number="47">Let the mob stone them and attack them with their swords. Let their sons and daughters be slaughtered and their houses set on fire.</verse>
				<verse number="48">This is how I shall purge the land of lewdness so that all women will be warned not to commit prostitution as you have done.</verse>
				<verse number="49">And you two sisters, you will be punished as your sins deserve. You will bear the price for your immorality and your vile idolatry. Then you will know that I am Lord Yahweh.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="24">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me and said: “Son of man, write down today’s date: January 15, the ninth year of your captivity, for this is the very day the king of Babylon begins his attack on Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">Pronounce this parable for these rebels: ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: “ ‘Put a cooking pot on the fire; put it on and fill it with water.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Take one of the best of the flock, kill it, cut it in pieces, then put the best pieces in the pot — the thighs, the shoulders, and the choicest joints. Fill the pot with the most tender cuts, pile firewood underneath it and boil it until the bones are thoroughly cooked.</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6">“ ‘For the Lord Yahweh says this: Disaster is in store for the bloody city, for you are like a scum-filled cooking pot that no amount of scrubbing can make clean! Empty the pot, piece by piece, in whatever order it comes.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For your city is still full of bloodshed. Your people have poured the blood of your murdered victims on the bare rocks. You didn’t bother to pour it on the ground where at least the dust could cover it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">To awaken my anger and exact vengeance, I have put the blood of those you murdered on a bare rock where it will not be hidden!</verse>
				<verse number="9">“ ‘I, Lord Yahweh, say to you: Doom is in store for the city of bloodshed. I, too, will pile up wood for the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Heap on the firewood! Light it! Cook the meat well until the broth boils away, until the bones are burned up!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Set the empty pot on the coals until it gets hot and the metal glows red-hot. The scum will become soft enough to scrub, and what is left will be burned off.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But it still can’t be cleaned and its scum can’t be removed, so into the fire you go!</verse>
				<verse number="13">“ ‘ Jerusalem, the filth of your sexual immorality is infamous. Although I have tried to purify you, you were not cleansed of your filth, so now you will never be purged of your filth until I have emptied out my fury upon you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I, Yahweh, have decreed it. The time has come, and I will do it! I will not hold back or relent. I will show you no pity. I will judge you according to the way you have lived and acted. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh spoke to me and said,</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Son of man, behold, in the blink of an eye I am about to take from you your heart’s dearest treasure, the one you love the most. But you must not weep or wail or let your tears stream down your cheeks.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Let no one hear your sobbing; don’t show that you are grieving. Wrap a turban around your head, put sandals on your feet, and dress normally. Don’t cover your face, and don’t eat the customary food of mourners.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">So, I preached to the people the next day as usual, and by evening, my wife had died. And I did as I had been instructed.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The people then said to me, “What’s the meaning of this? Why are you acting this way?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then Yahweh spoke to me and I replied, “ Yahweh told me</verse>
				<verse number="21">to prophesy to the people of Israel the words of Lord Yahweh: ‘Behold! I am about to make my sanctuary ritually unclean. My temple has become your boast, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes, the joy of your hearts, and you believe it will keep you safe. But your children whom you left behind in Jerusalem will be killed by the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then you will do as I have done; you will not cover your faces nor eat the customary food of mourners.</verse>
				<verse number="23">You will keep turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn nor weep but will waste away for your sins and groan among yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Thus Ezekiel is a sign for you. Everything he has done, you will do. And when this happens, you will certainly know that I am Lord Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="25">“And you, son of man, this is what will happen on the day that I deprive them of their temple -stronghold, their beautiful joy and glory, their heart’s desire, and their greatest treasure—I will also take away their sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And on that day a survivor from Jerusalem will bring you the report.</verse>
				<verse number="27">That same day, when he comes to you, your mouth will be opened, and you will be able to prophesy to the survivor and be silent no longer. And you will be a living symbol of hope for them, and they will see and acknowledge that I am Yahweh!”</verse>

			<chapter number="25">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me and said,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, turn toward the land of the Ammonites and prophesy against them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Say to them, ‘Hear the words of Lord Yahweh. He says to you: You gloated when my temple became unfit for my presence. You celebrated when the land of Israel was left in ruins. And when the people of Judah were taken into captivity, you shouted, “Hooray!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Therefore, behold! I am handing you over to the tribes of the eastern desert to come and take possession of you. They will take over your country and make their home in you. They will feast on the crops of your fields and drink the milk.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I will turn your great city Rabbah into a camel yard. Yes, I will turn all the land of Ammon into sheepfolds. Then you will recognize that I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“ ‘Furthermore, Lord Yahweh says to you: Since you have clapped your hands and danced for joy, full of malicious glee at Israel’s fate,</verse>
				<verse number="7">therefore behold! My mighty hand will be against you for this. I will hand you over to be looted by the nations, and I will obliterate you as a nation and you will perish as a country. I will reduce you to nothing, and then you will recognize that I am Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Lord Yahweh says: “Moab and Seir have said that the people of Judah are no different from any other nation.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Therefore, behold! I will let your enemies clear out the cities that defend the border of Moab—your fine cities, jewels of your land—Beth Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiriathaim.</verse>
				<verse number="10">To the same eastern desert tribes that invade Ammon, I will hand over Moab so that Ammon will be forgotten forever as a nation.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I will carry out my punishment of Moab, and then they will know that I am Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Lord Yahweh says: “The people of Edom took revenge on the people of Judah and sinned greatly in doing so.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Therefore, Lord Yahweh says to you: ‘My hand will be against you, and I will slaughter every person and animal living among you. There will be no one left anywhere in the land, from Teman to Dedan, all the people will fall by the sword!</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will use my people Israel to take my vengeance on Edom. My people will treat Edom as my furious anger demands, and they will realize that this is my vengeance! I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Lord Yahweh says, “The Philistines took revenge on the people of Judah, with deep hatred. They did their best to destroy them because of their long-standing hatred.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Therefore, Lord Yahweh says to you: My hand will be against the Philistines; I will exterminate the Cherethite tribe and destroy the rest of the coastal peoples.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I will execute frightful acts of vengeance and punish them in my wrath! And then they will realize that I, Yahweh, exacted my vengeance on them.”</verse>

				<verse number="4">They will destroy the walls of Tyre, and demolish her high towers. I will sweep away her rubble and reduce her to nothing but a bare rock.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Tyre will be an island where fishermen dry out their nets. Your enemies will take away everything you have. I, Lord Yahweh, have decreed it.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And as for her settlements on the mainland, they will all be slaughtered, and they will certainly learn that I am Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Lord Yahweh says to Tyre: “Look! I will bring Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the world’s most powerful king, sweeping down from the north to destroy you with horses, chariots, cavalry, and an enormous army.</verse>
				<verse number="8">His armies will massacre your settlements on the mainland. They will lay siege to you and construct towers to attack you. They will build siege-ramps against you and lay siege to you with interlocking shields over their heads.</verse>
				<verse number="9">His soldiers will pummel your walls with battering rams and demolish your towers with iron bars.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You’ll be covered with dust from their many horses and chariots. Your walls will shake at the rumble of their chariot wheels. His thundering horses will make your walls tremble as they storm through your gates and breach your walls.</verse>

				<verse number="2">“Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: “ ‘Because your heart is swollen with pride, you have said, “I am a god. I sit in the seat of a god, enthroned in the heart of the sea.” You think you are as wise as a god, but you’re nothing but a man, not a god at all!</verse>
				<verse number="3">So, you really think you are wiser than Daniel, and no mystery baffles you?</verse>
				<verse number="4">By your wisdom and vast understanding you have amassed a great fortune! You have accumulated gold and silver and placed them into your royal treasuries.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Through your great wisdom in trading, your fortune has continued to increase, but it has made your heart grow prouder.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Therefore, Lord Yahweh says to you: Do you really think your heart is like the heart of God?</verse>
				<verse number="7">See for yourself as I bring ruthless enemies against you, the most brutal of the nations! They will unleash their swords against all that your marvelous wisdom has built, and they will strike down your splendor!</verse>
				<verse number="8">You will die a violent death in the heart of the sea. They will throw you down into the abyss!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Will you still say in the presence of your killers, “ Don’t you know I’m a god?” But you will be merely a mortal man, and not a god, when you are in the clutches of the ones who strike you down!</verse>
				<verse number="10">You will die like an outcast, a shameful death at the hand of foreigners. I, Lord Yahweh, have decreed it!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Son of man, mourn for the king of Tyre. Say to him, ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: “ ‘You were once the consummate model of perfection. You were full of great wisdom, and your beauty seemed perfect.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You lived in Eden, in the very garden of God. Every precious jewel formed your mantle. You were dressed in splendor with diamonds, carnelian, topaz, chrysolite, beryl, onyx, sapphire, turquoise, and emeralds; each gem engraved in settings of gold. I, Yahweh, made them for you on the day I created you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I placed you with an anointed guardian cherub. You were on the holy mountain of God where you walked among the fiery stones.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Your ways were blameless from the day I created you, until wickedness first appeared in you.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Your vast wealth filled you with violence and sin. So, I have cast you down in disgrace from the mountain of God. I banished you, O guardian cherub, from among the stones of fire.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Your heart became swollen with pride because of your beauty; your thirst for glory corrupted your wisdom. So, I hurled you down to the earth, and displayed you as a warning to other kings.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So great was your sin— the injustice of your buying and selling. You defiled your sanctuaries. So, I set a fire inside of you, and it consumed you entirely! I reduced you to ashes on the ground before the eyes of all who saw you.</verse>
				<verse number="19">All who once knew you are stunned at your fate. You have come to a terrible, dreadful end, and will be no more!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yahweh spoke to me and said,</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Son of man, turn toward Sidon and prophesy against her</verse>
				<verse number="22">with these words: ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: “ ‘Behold, I am against you, Sidon; I will manifest my glory in you when I bring my judgment upon you! Everyone will see my display of holiness and they will know that I am Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="23">For I will send a plague, and there will be blood in her streets. Enemies will attack her on all sides by the sword raised up against her, and the dead will fall in heaps within the city. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="24">“As for the people of Israel, there will no longer be any hostile nation surrounding them like thorns or briars that would hurt or pierce them. Then people will know that I am Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Lord Yahweh says: “When I regather the people of Israel from every place where they have been scattered, I will display my holiness among them for all the nations to see. They will live in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And they will live there securely, building houses and planting vineyards. When I execute judgment on all the mocking, hostile nations surrounding them, they will live in safety, and they will know that I am Yahweh, the God they worship.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="29">
				<verse number="1">In the tenth year of our exile, on the twelfth day of the tenth month, Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, turn toward Hophra king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Tell them what I, Lord Yahweh, say: “ ‘Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt— the great monster wallowing in its waterways. You boasted: “I made the Nile River for myself, and I own it!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">I will put hooks through your jaws, and make the fish of the Nile stick to your scales. Then I will drag you out of your waterways with all your fish clinging to your scales.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I will leave you and all your fish on the ground to die in the desert. You will die in the open field, and I will feed you to the wild animals and the birds of heaven, and no one will collect your bones or bury them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh. “ ‘ The Lord says to Egypt: You have been no help whatsoever to my people, Israel; you are nothing more than a crutch of flimsy reeds!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Wherever they grasped you, you broke in their hands and splinters pierced their hands. Whenever they leaned on you, you collapsed, and sent them sprawling.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“ ‘So, Lord Yahweh says to you: I will bring war against you to eliminate both people and animals.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The land of Egypt will become an empty desert, and they will know that I am Yahweh. Because you boasted, “The Nile is mine, I made it. It’s all mine,”</verse>
				<verse number="10">therefore, I am your enemy and the enemy of your waterways. I will reduce Egypt to a desolate, empty desert, from Migdol in the north to Syene in the south, as far as the border of Ethiopia.</verse>
				<verse number="11">No person or animal will pass through it. For forty years it will remain uninhabited.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will turn Egypt into the most desolate of lands, and for forty years its cities will be the most desolate of ruined cities. And I will scatter your people among the nations and disperse them among foreign lands.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“ ‘However, Lord Yahweh says this: After forty years, I will gather the Egyptians back from the nations where I scattered them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will bring the Egyptian captives back and restore them to the way they were before in their homeland of Pathros. There they will be an insignificant kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Egypt will be the weakest kingdom of all and no longer dominate other nations. For I will reduce it so that it will never again rule over the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="16">It will never again be strong enough for the people of Israel to trust in. Its fate will be a reminder of Israel’s sin when they put their confidence in Egypt to help them. Then they will know that I am Lord Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="17">In the twenty-seventh year of our exile, on the first day of the first month, Yahweh spoke to me, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken his army and launched an attack against Tyre and inflicted a heavy toll upon his soldiers. Their helmets have rubbed their heads bare, and their heavy loads made their shoulders raw and chafed, yet neither Nebuchadnezzar nor his army gained any reward from the campaign he led against Tyre.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I, Lord Yahweh, will hand Egypt over to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. He will carry off its riches and loot the wealth of Egypt to pay the wages of his army.</verse>
				<verse number="20">I am giving him Egypt as a reward for the labor he has undertaken on my behalf. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken!</verse>
				<verse number="21">“At that time, I will raise up a new day of power for the people of Israel. And Ezekiel, I will open your mouth, and when you speak, the people will listen to you. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="30">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, prophesy and announce what I, Lord Yahweh, say to Egypt: “ ‘Weep and wail, for the day of disaster is here!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yes, the day is near, the day of Yahweh is near! It will be a day dark with clouds, a time of trouble for the nations.’</verse>
				<verse number="4">“War will come upon Egypt, and terror will invade the land of Ethiopia. Egypt’s foundations will be leveled, multitudes will be slaughtered, and her riches will be carried away.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Egypt and all her allies, Ethiopia, Libya, and Lydia, all Arabia, and Kub —they will all fall by the sword!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Yahweh says, “Egypt’s allies will fall, and the pride of Egypt’s might will crumble. They will fall by the sword from Migdol in the north to Syene in the south. I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“They will be the most desolate in the midst of wasted countries, and their cities the most ruined among ruined cities.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then they will know that I am Yahweh when I set fire to Egypt and shatter all who support her.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“At that time, I will dispatch messengers by river ships to terrify the unsuspecting Ethiopians. They will panic on the day of Egypt’s doom. Judgment is sure to come!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Lord Yahweh says: I will use the armies of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to destroy the huge population of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I will bring him and his savage armies to ravage the country. They will wage war against Egypt and fill the country with corpses.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will dry up the waterways of the Nile and hand over the country to evil men. I will cause the land to be destroyed and everything in it, at the hand of foreigners. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Lord Yahweh says: “I will demolish the idols and destroy the false gods from Noph. Egypt will be left without a ruler and a plague of fear will sweep over Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will make southern Egypt deserted, burn Zoan to the ground, and punish Thebes.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I will pour out my fury on Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt. I will wipe out the great population of Thebes.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I will set Egypt on fire! Pelusium will be seized with great agony! The walls of Thebes will be torn down, and Noph will face distress daily from her enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And the cities of Heliopolis and Bubastis will go into captivity and their young soldiers will fall by the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="18">At Tahpanhes, I will turn day to darkness when I shatter Egypt’s strength and silence the boast of her might. I will blanket Egypt with dark clouds, and her people will go into captivity.</verse>
				<verse number="19">That is how I will punish Egypt, and then they will acknowledge that I am Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">In the eleventh year of our captivity, on the seventh day of the first month, Yahweh spoke to me, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Son of man, I have broken the powerful arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Behold, you can see that no one has set the bone to make it heal. No one has wrapped it to help it heal and get strong enough to hold a sword again.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Therefore, Lord Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt; I will break both his arms, the strong one and the broken one, and I will make him drop the sword from his hand.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I will scatter the Egyptians to the wind and disperse them among the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="24">I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand. I will break Pharaoh’s arms, and he will moan in pain like a dying man before the Babylonian king.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but I will make the arms of Pharaoh hang limp. And they will know that I am Yahweh when I put my sword into the hands of the king of Babylon and he wields it against Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among foreign lands. And then the people of Egypt will acknowledge that I am Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="31">
				<verse number="1">In the eleventh year of our captivity, on the first day of the third month, Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and his multitude: ‘Who is comparable to you in your greatness?</verse>
				<verse number="3">I know who: Assyria! Once it was like a cedar tree in Lebanon, with its noble branches, its forest shade, and its lofty height, its treetop among the clouds.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Plenty of water has made it grow, deep springs have made it tall. Streams flow all around where it was planted, sending rivulets to all the other trees.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So it towered high, much higher than the other trees of the forest. Because of the plentiful waters making it grow, its branches increased in number and spread out very far.</verse>
				<verse number="6">All the birds of heaven nested in its strong branches, and wild animals gave birth under its shade. Many, many people sat in its shadow.</verse>
				<verse number="7">It was beautiful in its greatness, tall, with such large branches! For its roots were planted in plentiful waters.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The mighty cedar tree was unrivaled in God’s garden. No cypress compares to such lovely branches as these; No sycamore could match its splendor. No tree in the garden of God could match its beauty.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I made it so lovely with its many branches. It was the envy of every tree in Eden, the garden of God.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Therefore, Lord Yahweh says: “Because it towered so high with its top into the clouds and its heart was proud about its height,</verse>
				<verse number="11">I have rejected it! I have handed it over to the mightiest of the nations to be punished as its wickedness deserves.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The most ruthless of nations cut down the cedar and left it deserted. Its broken branches littered the mountains, the valleys, and every ravine throughout the country. Those who once sat in its shadow have fled and abandoned it.</verse>
				<verse number="13">All the birds of heaven settled in the fallen tree, and all the wild animals lay among its branches.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“So from now on, let no tree, no matter how well-watered, grow that high again with its top pushing into the clouds. And let no watered tree grow that tall again. For all of them are doomed to death, and they will join those in the depths of the underworld of mortals with those who go down to the pit.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Lord Yahweh says: “The day I cast it down to Sheol, I caused it to mourn, covering it with the deep springs. For I stopped its underground rivers, and I reduced the flow of the once plentiful waters. I clothed Lebanon with gloom as they mourned for the cedar tree, and all the trees withered because of it.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I made the nations quake at the crashing sound of its fall. They trembled as I hurled it down to Sheol with those who sink into the pit. In the depths of the underworld, all the trees of Eden, the finest well-watered trees of Lebanon, were comforted when the cedar tree joined them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And the nations who sat in its shadow went down to Sheol with it to join those slaughtered by the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Which of Eden’s trees could be compared to you in glory and greatness? Yet you have been hurled down with the trees of Eden to the depths of the underworld. You will lie among the uncircumcised and with those who have been slaughtered by the sword. So much for Pharaoh and all his multitudes! I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="32">
				<verse number="1">In the twelfth year of our captivity, on the first day of the twelfth month, Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, give a solemn warning to Pharaoh king of Egypt. Say to him: “ ‘You are like a young lion prowling among the nations, or like a sea monster lurking in your lagoons! You churn up the water with your trampling and muddy their streams.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Lord Yahweh says to you: I will throw my net over you using a large group of nations. They will drag you to shore in my net, and I will leave you high and dry.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I will fling you onto the open field and abandon you on the ground. I will gather all the birds of the air to feast on your flesh, and all the beasts of the earth will gorge themselves on you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I will scatter bits and pieces of your flesh on the hills and fill the valleys with your rotting corpse.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I will drench the land with your oozing blood until it fills the ravines and spreads to the base of the mountains.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When I snuff you out, I will hide the skies and darken the stars. I will cover the sun with clouds and turn off the moonlight.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Heaven’s bright lights above you I will darken and shroud your land in darkness. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“ ‘I will trouble the hearts of many peoples when I spread the news of your destruction to nations and lands unknown to you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">What I do to you will stun many nations. When I brandish my sword before them all, their kings will shudder with horror at your fate. On the day they see you fall, each will tremble in terror, fearing your fate might become theirs!</verse>
				<verse number="11">“ ‘For Lord Yahweh says to Egypt: The king of Babylon is coming to attack you!</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will cause your great army to fall by the swords of mighty warriors. They are the most barbaric of nations. They will slice the pride of Egypt into pieces, and all your people will be destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I will also slaughter your livestock grazing beside the plentiful waters. No person or animal will muddy the water in the watering places with their feet and hooves.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then I will settle their waters and make their rivers flow as smoothly as oil. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“ ‘When I reduce Egypt to a desolate wasteland and strip the land of all it contains, when I annihilate all who live there, then they will acknowledge that I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“ ‘This is the funeral song that people will sing in mourning for Egypt. Women of other nations will sing in lament for it. They will utter a lamentation for the land of Egypt and all its many people. I, Lord Yahweh, decree it!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="17">In the twelfth year of our captivity, on the fifteenth day of the twelfth month, Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Son of man, weep and mourn for the vast population of Egypt, and for the other mighty nations. For I will send them down to the world below with all who sink into the pit.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“ Tell them, ‘Egypt, are you more favored than the other nations? Down with you! Go down and make your bed with the uncircumcised dead,</verse>
				<verse number="20">with those who have been slaughtered by the sword! I will hand you and all your people over to the sword, and they will drag you away.</verse>
				<verse number="21">From the depths of Sheol, the mightiest heroes, your allies, will shout to you, “Now they have come down. They have joined us among the uncircumcised dead, slaughtered by the sword.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">“ ‘Assyria is there with all her hordes, with the graves of her soldiers all around her. They fell on the battlefield, slaughtered by the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="23">They made their graves in the deepest part of the pit. Her hordes surround her grave; they were all slaughtered! Those who once spread their terror throughout the world of the living now lie silent, slaughtered by the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“ ‘Elam is there, along with the graves of all her hordes. They were slaughtered—fallen by the sword. Those who once spread their terror throughout the land of the living have now joined the uncircumcised dead in the depths of the underworld. They have been disgraced and ashamed with those who sink into the pit.</verse>
				<verse number="25">They have made a grave for her among her slaughtered multitudes, surrounded by all their tombs, all of them uncircumcised, slaughtered by the sword for having spread terror throughout the land of the living. They have carried their shame with them, with all those who sink into the pit. They have been placed among the slaughtered.</verse>
				<verse number="26">“ ‘Meshech and Tubal are in the graveyard with their hordes all around their graves. They are all the uncircumcised dead, slaughtered by the sword for having spread their terror throughout the land of the living.</verse>
				<verse number="27">They were not buried with the great warriors of ancient times. When the mighty warriors died, they went into Sheol wearing all their armor. When people buried them, they placed their swords under their heads and their shields on top of their bodies because these valiant heroes once terrorized the land of the living.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And you, Pharaoh, will be broken and lie among the uncircumcised, with those slaughtered by the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="29">“ ‘Edom is there, her kings and all her rulers, who, despite their might, have been buried with those slaughtered by the sword. They lie with the uncircumcised, with those who sink into the pit.</verse>
				<verse number="30">“ ‘All the princes of the north and all the Sidonians are there. They have gone down in disgrace with the slaughtered because their powerful armies once terrified their enemies. They lie among the uncircumcised dead, those slaughtered by the sword who bear their shame with those who sink into the pit.</verse>
				<verse number="31">“ ‘When Pharaoh and all his army see them, it will bring him some consolation at the sight of all his hordes killed by the sword. I, Yahweh, decree it!</verse>
				<verse number="32">Although I made him spread terror throughout the land of the living, he and all his hordes will be buried with the uncircumcised dead who were slaughtered by the sword. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="33">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, give your people this message: ‘If I bring war to your nation, you must select a man and post him as a watchman.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When he sees the enemy coming to attack, he must sound his shofar to warn the people.</verse>
				<verse number="4">If people hear the warning but pay no attention and the sword overtakes them and kills them, they will bear the responsibility for their own deaths.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Because they heard the sound of the shofar and paid no attention to the warning, their deaths are their own faults. But if they had listened to the warning, they could have saved their lives.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“ ‘If, however, the watchman sees the enemy approaching but has not blown his shofar to warn the people and the sword overtakes them and kills a single one of them, even though that person was a sinner, I will still hold the watchman responsible for that person’s death.’</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Son of man, I have appointed you as watchman for the people of Israel. When you hear me speak a warning, give them my warning.</verse>
				<verse number="8">If I say to the wicked, ‘Evildoers, you are about to die,’ and you fail to warn them to renounce their evil ways, they will die for their guilt, but I will hold you responsible for their deaths.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But if you warn the wicked to change their evil behavior and they refuse to change, the wicked will die for their sins, but you will have saved your own life.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Son of man, say to the people of Israel, ‘You continually say: Our rebellious acts and our sins have caught up with us, and we are wasting away because of them. How then can we live?’</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Say to them, ‘As surely as I, Lord Yahweh, exist—I take no delight in the death of the wicked, but I delight in seeing them turn from their ways so they can live. So, repent and turn from your evil ways. People of Israel, why would you want to die? Turn and come back to me! ’</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Son of man, say to your people, ‘All the good things a good person has done will not be any help if that one decides to turn to sin. And all the sins of an evil person will not destroy him if the evildoer decides to repent and turn from sin. If the righteous turns to sin, the righteous person will not be able to live because of past righteous deeds.’</verse>
				<verse number="13">Suppose I say to a righteous person: ‘You will certainly live,’ but then he becomes confident in his righteousness and turns away and willfully sins; none of the good things he has done in the past will be remembered. He will die in his sins.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If, however, I say to a wicked person: ‘You will certainly die,’ but then the wicked turns away from sin and does what is just and right</verse>
				<verse number="15">by returning what has been stolen and returning the borrower’s pledge and by following the laws that give life and no longer doing wrong, that person will live and will not die.</verse>
				<verse number="16">None of his previous sins will be counted against him, for he has done what is just and right—therefore, he will certainly live.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Yet your people say: ‘The ways of the Lord are not right.’ But it is their ways that are not right!</verse>
				<verse number="18">When an upright person turns away from what is right and does what is evil, that person will die for it.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And when a wicked person turns from being wicked and does what is just and right, that person will live.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yet you say: ‘The ways of the Lord are not right.’ Listen, people of Israel, I will judge each of you according to your ways.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">In the eleventh year of our captivity, on the fifth day of the tenth month, one who escaped from Jerusalem arrived and informed me: “The city has been taken.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Now the evening before the survivor arrived, the mighty hand of Yahweh had rested on me, and my speech was fully restored before he came to me in the morning—I could speak again.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then Yahweh said to me,</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Son of man, the people who are living in the ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one man when he took possession of the land, but we are many. Certainly, we can possess this land and rebuild.’</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Now give the people this message, ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: Do you really think you can take ownership of the land? You are evildoers! You murder others, you eat meat with blood, and you worship your foul idols.</verse>
				<verse number="26">You rely on your swords, you engage in despicable pagan practices, and you are all adulterers. Do you really think I will give the ownership of the land to you?’</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Tell them that I, Lord Yahweh, solemnly warn them: As surely as I exist, those living in the ruined towns will fall by the sword, those in the countryside I will give to the wild animals for them to eat, and those among the crags and in caves will die from disease.</verse>
				<verse number="28">I will turn the land into a total wasteland, and I will put an end to their arrogant power. Israel’s mountains will be so deserted that no one will pass that way again.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I turn the land into a barren desert because of all the filthy things they have done.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">“As for you, son of man, your fellow citizens are talking about you beside the walls and in the doorways of their homes. They keep saying to one another, ‘Let’s go hear what Yahweh has to say.’</verse>
				<verse number="31">They all flock to you to sit at your feet as my people. They listen to your words, but they will not act on them. Instead, they express genuine devotion to Yahweh, but their hearts are set on cheating others.</verse>
				<verse number="32">As far as they are concerned, you are like an entertainer who sings a love song with a beautiful voice to a good musical accompaniment. They hear what you say, but no one will do it.</verse>
				<verse number="33">When all your prophecies come true —and they are beginning to be fulfilled now—they will know that there has been a true prophet among them.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="34">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Son of man, prophesy against the leaders of Israel; prophesy and say to them, ‘Listen, you leaders, Lord Yahweh has a message for you: Disaster is in store for the shepherds of Israel whose only concern is to feed themselves. Aren’t shepherds supposed to feed the sheep?</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yet you eat the fat, you shear the sheep to make your clothes, you slaughter the fattest sheep for your feasts, but you never feed the flock.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You haven’t cared for the weak ones, brought healing to the sick, nor bandaged those who are injured. You haven’t looked for the strays nor brought the lost back to the fold. Instead, you have ruled over them cruelly and treated them harshly.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Because there was no shepherd to care for the sheep, they were scattered and were eaten by every wild beast.</verse>
				<verse number="6">My flock has wandered aimlessly over every hill and mountain over the face of the earth, and no one went to look for them or tried to find them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“ ‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:</verse>
				<verse number="8">As surely as I live, declares Lord Yahweh —my sheep have become the prey of every wild beast. Since there was no shepherd to protect my sheep, they have been devoured. My shepherds have not searched for my sheep; they have cared for themselves and not the flock.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:</verse>
				<verse number="10">Lord Yahweh says: Behold, I am against you selfish shepherds! I will hold you accountable for my flock, and I will demand that you return my flock to me. No longer will you feed only yourselves because I will rescue my sheep from your mouths. You will help yourselves to my sheep no longer.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11">“For Lord Yahweh says: ‘From now on, I will personally search for my sheep and look after them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As a good shepherd searches after his scattered sheep, so I will look after my sheep and rescue them from wherever they have been scattered on the day of disaster.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I will bring them back from foreign countries and gather them together as my flock and return them to their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the valley streams and in all the fertile places.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will feed them in fair meadows and on the slopes of the mountains of Israel. There they will lie down in good grazing grounds and graze in green pastures on the mountains of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will give them rest. I will seek out the lost one, bring back the stray, bandage the injured, and heal those that are sick. I will watch over the fat and healthy of the flock. I will be a true, caring shepherd to them. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">“ ‘As for you, my sheep, Lord Yahweh says to you: I am the one who judges between one sheep and the other, between rams and billy goats.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Since you’re not satisfied with feeding from the best pastures, you also trample down the rest of the grass. You’re not satisfied to drink the clean water; must you also muddy up the rest of the water with your feet?</verse>
				<verse number="19">Is it right that my sheep have to eat what you have walked all over? Is it right that they must drink muddy water because of your trampling feet?</verse>
				<verse number="20">Therefore, Lord Yahweh says this: I am the one who judges between the strong sheep and the weak.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Because you shove with your side and your shoulder and thrust your horns at all the weak sheep until you scatter them, therefore,</verse>
				<verse number="22">I will come and save my sheep and rescue them from being victimized. I will judge between one sheep and another.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“ ‘I will raise up one shepherd over them, like my servant David, and put him in charge of my flock to feed them. He will care for them and be their shepherd.</verse>
				<verse number="24">I, Yahweh, will be their God, and my servant, like David, will be their prince taken from among them. I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of its wild beasts. Then they will be able to live securely in the wilderness and sleep soundly in the forest.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And I will make them and the places all around my sacred hill a blessing. And I will send showers of blessing —showers will come down in their season.</verse>
				<verse number="27">And the tree of the field will yield its luscious fruit, the earth will yield its harvest, and they will live safely in their own land. When I set them free from slavery and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them, then they will acknowledge that I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Foreign powers will no longer plunder them; the wild beasts of the land will no longer feast on them. They will live safe and secure, with no one to frighten them.</verse>
				<verse number="29">I will establish for them a planting of renown so that they will no longer suffer from famine. And they will no longer have to endure the insults of other nations.</verse>
				<verse number="30">So they will know that I, Yahweh, am with them as their God. And they, the people of Israel, will know that they are my people—declares the Lord Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And you, my people, are my sheep, the flock of my pasture are people, and I am your God. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>

			<chapter number="37">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh ’s powerful presence was upon me, and his Spirit lifted me up and carried me away. He set me down in the middle of a valley floor that was covered with countless bones.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He made me walk all around the valley among all the vast piles of bones. There in the valley there were very many, very dry bones.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh asked me, “Son of man, can these bones come back to life again?” And I replied, “Lord Yahweh, you are the only one who knows.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these dry bones these words, ‘Dry bones, hear what Yahweh says.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Lord Yahweh says to you: “ ‘I am now going to breathe into you, and you will live again!</verse>
				<verse number="6">I will attach muscles and sinews to you. I will make flesh grow on you. I will cover you with skin. I am going to breathe into you, and you will live again. And you will know that I am Yahweh.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So I prophesied as I had been told. And as I was prophesying, I began to hear a commotion. Behold! It was the clattering of these many skeletons coming together, bone to bone!</verse>
				<verse number="8">And as I kept watching, muscles and sinews miraculously appeared! Flesh grew on the bones, and then skin wrapped completely around them, yet there was still no life-breath in them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Yahweh said to me, “Prophesy to the breath. Yes, prophesy, son of man. Say to the breath, ‘Lord Yahweh says: Divine breath, come now from the four winds. Breathe on these lifeless bodies, so that they can live again.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So I prophesied as he had told me, and the breath entered their bodies. They came alive, got up from the ground, and stood to their feet—a very great, immense army.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones represent the entire house of Israel. They keep saying, ‘We are as dry as these dead bones. Our nation has been completely destroyed, and we have lost all hope.’</verse>
				<verse number="12">“So, prophesy to them, ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: Behold! I am now going to open your graves! My people, I will resurrect you out of your graves and lead you home to the land of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And when I open your graves and raise you up, then, my people, you will be convinced that I am Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And I will put my Holy Spirit within you, and you will live again. I will resettle you on your own soil. Then you will know that it is I, Yahweh, who spoke to you, and I do what I say. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Son of man, take a stick and carve on it the words, ‘For Judah and all the Israelites with him.’ Then take another stick and carve on it the words, ‘The stick of Ephraim, for Joseph and all the Israelites with him.’</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now join them together to make a single piece of wood to become one stick in your hand.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And when your fellow exiles ask, ‘Won’t you tell us what you mean by this?’</verse>
				<verse number="19">answer them, ‘Lord Yahweh says: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph that belongs to Ephraim and those tribes loyal to him and join them to the stick of Judah. I will make two sticks into one, a single stick in my hand.’</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Now, show the people the pieces of wood you have written on,</verse>
				<verse number="21">and tell them, ‘Lord Yahweh says this: I will gather the Israelites from the nations where they have gone. I will gather them together from everywhere and bring them to their homeland.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And I will make them into a single nation in the mountainous land of Israel and give them one king to be king over them all. They will never again be divided into two nations nor split into two separate kingdoms.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Never again will they defile themselves with their disgusting idols, their detestable things, and rebellions. I will save them from always turning back and repeating their old sins. I will cleanse and purify them. They will be my people, and I shall be their God.</verse>

				<verse number="25">They will live in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where your ancestors once lived. They and their children and grandchildren will live in it forever, and David my servant will be their prince forever.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I will make my eternal covenant of peace with them. I will resettle them, and I will bless them and multiply them. I will establish my sanctuary among them forever.</verse>
				<verse number="27">I will make my home above them. I will be their God, and they will be my beloved people.</verse>

				<verse number="1">In the first month of the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, on the tenth day of the month, and nearly fourteen years after the Babylonians captured Jerusalem, on that day Yahweh overpowered me and carried me away to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="2">In an ecstatic vision from God, he carried me away to the land of Israel and put me down on a very high mountain. As I looked toward the south, there was a group of buildings that seemed to be a city.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And when he brought me closer to the buildings, behold, I saw a man standing in the gateway. His appearance was shining and glistening like polished bronze. He held a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The shining man said to me, “Son of man, look closely and listen carefully. Pay close attention to everything I show you, for I have brought you here to reveal these things to you. You must tell the people of Israel everything you see.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Behold, I saw an outer wall surrounding the whole area where the temple stood. And the shining man was holding a measuring reed, and its length was six long cubits, each cubit a forearm and a handbreadth. He measured the wall with the reed, and it was one reed high and one reed thick.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He went into the opening of the gateway facing east, climbed the steps, and measured its threshold as one reed deep.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Beyond the threshold was a corridor, which had rooms on each side for the guards. Each of the side rooms was square and measured one reed on each side. The space between the side rooms was five cubits. And the inside threshold of the gate leading to the portico facing the temple was one reed deep.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then he measured the porch of the gate on the inside.</verse>
				<verse number="9">It was eight cubits deep, flanked by pillars two cubits thick. The porch opened onto the temple courtyard.</verse>
				<verse number="10">On each side of the east gate there were three guardrooms, all three the same size, and the walls that separated them were the same size.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He measured the width of the entrance as ten cubits and its length, thirteen cubits.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And there was a low wall one cubit high in front of the guardrooms. Each of the guardrooms was six cubits square.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then he measured the width of the gate from the top back wall of one guardroom to the top back wall of the opposite one. It was twenty-five cubits straight across.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He calculated the height of the porch, which led out to a courtyard, as sixty cubits high.</verse>
				<verse number="15">From the outside wall of the gate to the far side of the porch, he measured as fifty cubits.</verse>
				<verse number="16">On all the inside walls of the gateway were windows with narrow recesses all around. The walls of the guardrooms, the walls between them, and the walls of the porch likewise had windows all around. And there were palm trees carved on the inner walls of the corridor and on the doorways.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then the shining man brought me into the outer court, and behold, there was a spacious terrace paved with stones, and thirty chambers were built against the outer wall.</verse>
				<verse number="18">This paved terrace, or Lower Terrace, was as wide as the gateways were long and extended throughout the courtyard.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then he measured the width of the courtyard, from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was one hundred cubits on the east side. Then he went to measure the north side.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Behold, there was a gate in the outer courtyard that faced to the north. He measured its length and width.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The length of the gateway was fifty cubits, and its width was twenty-five cubits. Its pillars and porch were of the same size as those of the first gate. It also had three guardrooms on each side.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Its windows, its porch, and its palm trees were of the same measurement as those of the east gate. There were also seven steps leading up to it, and its porch was at the end facing the courtyard.</verse>
				<verse number="23">In the inner court across from the north gate there was another gateway leading into the inner courtyard, just as there was opposite the east gate. He measured the distance from one gate to the other, and it was one hundred cubits.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Next, the shining man took me to the south side, and behold, there was another gate. He measured its pillars and porch; they were of the same dimensions as the others.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The gateway, as well as its porch, had narrow windows all around, like the windows of the others; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five wide</verse>
				<verse number="26">and had seven steps leading up to it. Its porch was at the inner end and had palm trees carved on its pillars, one on either side.</verse>
				<verse number="27">There was also a lower gate on the south side of the inner court. He measured the distance southward from one gate to the other as one hundred cubits.</verse>
				<verse number="28">He then took me into the inner court by the south gate. He measured the south gate, and its dimensions were the same as the others.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Its guardrooms, pillars, and porch were also the same size as the others.</verse>
				<verse number="30">There were porches all around the gateway and each porch was fifty cubits long and five cubits wide.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The porches all faced the outer court with eight steps leading up to them. And palm trees were carved on the pillars of the corridor.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then he took me into the inner court on the east side and measured the gateway. It was identical in size to the others.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Its guardrooms, pillars, and porches were of the same dimensions as the others. The gateway, as well as its porch, had windows all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Its porch faced the outer court with eight steps leading up to it, and there were palm trees carved on its pillars.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then the shining man brought me to the north gate and measured it, and it had the same dimensions as the others.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Its guardrooms, pillars, and porches were of the same dimension as the others. The gateway had narrow windows all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Its porch faced the outer court, and there were eight steps leading up to it, and there were palm trees carved on its pillars on either side.</verse>
				<verse number="38">In each of the inner gateways there was a chamber with a doorway by the porch, where they washed the burnt offerings.</verse>
				<verse number="39">And inside the porches of the gates there were two tables placed on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings were slaughtered.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Outside the north gate, near the steps to the entrance, two tables were placed against both outside walls of the porches—</verse>
				<verse number="41">four tables inside and four tables outside, eight tables in all for slaughtering the animals for sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="42">There were also four slabs of hewn stone used for the burnt offerings that were each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high. The instruments used for slaughtering the burnt offerings and sacrificial animals were placed on these slabs.</verse>
				<verse number="43">And four-inch-long double-pronged hooks were fastened to the wall all around the stone tables. And the carcasses of the sacrificial animals were prepared on the tables.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Then he brought me into the inner courtyard just outside the north gate. Behold, I saw chambers for the singers of the inner court, one on the side of the north gate, facing south, the other on the side of the south gate, facing north.</verse>
				<verse number="45">The shining man told me, “The chamber facing south is for the priests responsible for the service of the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="46">And the chamber facing north is for the priests responsible for the sacrifices of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, for only the sons of Levi are permitted to go into Yahweh ’s presence to serve him.”</verse>
				<verse number="47">Then he measured the inner courtyard. It was one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, a square with the altar standing in front of the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Then he brought me to the entrance porch of the temple building, and he measured the gateposts of the porch. They were five cubits thick on either side, and the width of the gate was fourteen cubits. The sidewalls of the gate were three cubits on either side.</verse>
				<verse number="49">The entrance porch itself was twenty cubits long and twelve cubits wide. There were ten steps leading up to it, and there were pillars by the gateposts, one on either side.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="41">
				<verse number="1">The shining man brought me to the Holy Place and measured its doorframes; each was six cubits wide.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The width of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on each side, its length was forty cubits, and its width twenty cubits.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then he went inside the innermost chamber and measured the doorframes at the entrance as two cubits, then the entrance as six cubits, and the width of the entrance as seven cubits.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He measured its length and width as twenty cubits, at the end of the outer sanctuary. Then he said to me, “This is the Holy of Holies.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">He then measured the wall of the temple as six cubits thick. There were side rooms all around the temple that were each four cubits wide.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And there were three levels of the side rooms, with thirty rooms on each floor. All around the wall of the temple were ledges that served as supports for the side rooms so that they did not have to be attached to the temple wall for support.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The rooms were right up to the temple walls. The width of the side rooms increased, floor by floor, because the width of the temple increased as it got higher, from the lowest level through the middle level to the top level.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then I looked down and saw that the temple stood on a raised platform that surrounded it. The platform was a full measuring reed high (six cubits) and provided a foundation for the side rooms.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. On the raised platform there was a terrace all around the side rooms of the temple. It was twenty cubits between the edge of the platform and the rooms for the priests.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">And the doors of the side rooms faced an open area, one door toward the north and one door toward the south. The width of the open area was five cubits wide all around.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The building on the west side of the courtyard was seventy cubits wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then the shining man measured the length of the temple as one hundred cubits. The length of the courtyard plus the building and its walls was also one hundred cubits.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The width of the courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was likewise one hundred cubits.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then he measured the length of the building west of the courtyard, including its balconies on either side, which was also one hundred cubits. The entire inside of the Holy Place, the porches of the courtyard,</verse>
				<verse number="16">the thresholds, the windows, and the galleries on three sides that faced the threshold were paneled with wood all around, from the floor up to the windows. And the windows were screened with latticework.</verse>
				<verse number="17">On the door to the inner part of the temple and on all the walls all around, both inside and outside,</verse>
				<verse number="18">were carved alternating cherubim and palm trees. Each of the cherubim had two faces,</verse>
				<verse number="19">a human face that gazed toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a young lion turned toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved throughout the temple everywhere.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The Holy Place had the same pattern of cherubim and palm trees carved on the wall from the floor to the space above the doors.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The columns of the doorway to the Holy Place were square, and the columns at the entrance to the Holy of Holies were similar.</verse>
				<verse number="22">A wooden altar was there, three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits wide. Its corners, base, and sides were of wood. The shining man said to me, “This is the table that always stands in the presence of Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">The Holy Place and the Holy of Holies had double doors.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Each of the doors had two hinged leaves that swung open in the middle.</verse>
				<verse number="25">On the doors of the Holy Place were carved cherubim and palm trees just like those carved on the walls. There was a wooden roof over the outside of the doorway to the Holy Place.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And there were niches with palm trees on either side in the front walls of the temple porch. And the side rooms of the temple also had canopies.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="42">
				<verse number="1">Then the shining man brought me northward into the outer court and brought me to the rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north side.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Along the front, the building was one hundred cubits long on the north side and fifty cubits wide.</verse>
				<verse number="3">On one side of the building was the twenty-cubit-wide plaza of the inner courtyard. On the other side was the paved walkway of the outer courtyard. The building itself was three stories high and had balconies.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And in front of the rooms was an inner passageway, ten cubits wide and one hundred cubits long, and all their doors faced north.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The top-floor rooms were narrower than those on the middle and bottom stories of the building because the balconies took up some of the space of the lower stories.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The rooms on the third floor had no columns like the pillars of the outer courtyard. That is why the top story was narrower than the middle and bottom stories. The rooms became smaller the higher they went.</verse>
				<verse number="7">There was a wall in the outer courtyard, parallel to the rooms, that was fifty cubits long.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The wall was like this because the row of rooms along the outer courtyard was fifty cubits long, while the row of rooms that faced the temple was one hundred cubits long.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Beneath the rooms there was an entrance facing east so that a person could enter them from the outer court. On the south side of the temple, along the broad wall of the outer court, adjoining the temple courtyard, facing the outer wall there was a building containing rooms, with a passageway in front of them.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">These south side rooms were like those rooms on the north side, with the same entry and exit doors and the same dimensions. There was also an entrance to the rooms at the beginning of the walkway—the walkway before the corresponding wall that faced east.</verse>
				<verse number="12"></verse>
				<verse number="13">The shining man said to me, “The northern and southern rooms facing the courtyard are holy chambers, the place where the priests who approach Yahweh will eat the most holy offerings. Because this is a holy place, the most holy offerings will be stored there: the grain offering, the sacrifice for sin, and the guilt offering.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When the priests have served inside the temple, they must first take off their priestly garments and leave them in the rooms before going out into the courtyard. Their priestly garments are holy, so they must change their clothes before going near other people.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">When the shining man had finished measuring the inner temple area, he took me out through the east gate and measured the outside wall of the temple compound.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Using his measuring rod, he measured all the east side as five hundred cubits total.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He measured all the north side as five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He measured all the south side as five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then he turned to the west side and measured it as five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And so he measured the temple compound on all four sides. The wall of the temple compound was five hundred cubits square, to mark the boundary between what was holy and what was common.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="43">
				<verse number="1">Afterward, the shining man led me to the gate facing east.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And behold, I saw the glory of the God of Israel storming from the east with a roar! A thunderous sound came with him like the sound of a great waterfall. All the ground was glowing brightly, illuminated by his glorious presence.</verse>
				<verse number="3">This vision was like the one I had seen when he came to destroy the city and like those visions I had experienced by the River Chebar. Then I fell facedown to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The awesome glory of Yahweh entered the temple through the eastern gate.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Yahweh ’s Spirit lifted me into the air and set me down in the inner courtyard; and behold, I watched the glory of Yahweh like a cloud fill the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="6">While the shining man stood beside me, I heard the voice of one speaking to me from inside the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And he said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne, the place on which I will rest my feet, where I will live among the Israelites forever. And the people of Israel and their kings will never again drag my holy name through the mud. They will never disgrace me again by their spiritual prostitution or memorials to their dead kings</verse>
				<verse number="8">or by putting their threshold beside my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between us. They have defiled my holy name by their despicable practices, so in my anger I put an end to them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now they must put away their unfaithfulness of worshiping other gods and put away the corpses of their kings from my presence, and I will make my home with them forever.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Son of man, describe this temple in detail to the people of Israel so that they will be ashamed of their despicable deeds. Let them carefully study the perfect structure of the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then, if they truly express sorrow over their sins, explain to them the design and plan of the temple—its exits and entrances, its shape, its arrangement, the entire design, and all its rules for operation. Sketch it out for them so that they can observe and understand the entire plan and follow all its rules.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">“This is the law of the temple: the mountaintop radiates his glory, therefore, all around the Temple Mount will be a most holy area. Behold, this is the most important law of the temple.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“This is the measurement of the altar using the same unit of measurement as the rest of the temple: The base is one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim of one span around its edge. The altar itself is to be this high:</verse>
				<verse number="14">from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a width of one cubit. And from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits high and one cubit wide.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The altar hearth is to be four cubits high, with four horns projecting upward from the hearth,</verse>
				<verse number="16">and the hearth a perfect square: twelve cubits long by twelve cubits wide.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The ledge is also to be a square: fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide on four sides with a rim around it of half a cubit, and its surrounding base one cubit. Its steps are on the east side of the altar.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Lord Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, here are the rules you must follow when the altar is built to offer burnt offerings and to splash on it the blood of the animals they sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You must give a young bull to the Levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok. They are the ones who may come before me to serve me and offer the bull as a sacrifice for sin, declares Lord Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You must take some of its blood and smear it on the four horns, on the four corners of the ledge, and on its surrounding rim. In this way you will purify it and make atonement for it.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then take the bull offered as the sacrifice for sin and burn its carcass in the appointed place outside the sacred area.</verse>
				<verse number="22">On the second day, you must offer an unblemished male goat as the sin offering, and the priests must purify the altar again as they did on the first day with the bull.</verse>
				<verse number="23">When you have finished purifying the altar, you must offer a young, unblemished bull and a young, unblemished ram.</verse>
				<verse number="24">You must present them before me, and the Zadokite priests will sprinkle salt on them and offer them as burnt offerings to me.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Each day for seven days you must sacrifice to me a young male goat, a young bull, and a young ram as a sin offering. All of them must be unblemished animals.</verse>
				<verse number="26">In this way the altar will be purified, cleansed, and consecrated for seven days.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When the seven days of consecration are over, on the eighth day and each day afterward, the priest will offer burnt offerings and communion sacrifices on the altar on behalf of the people. And I will accept you and be pleased with you. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="44">
				<verse number="1">Then the shining man brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east, but it was shut.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh said to me, “This gate must be kept shut. No one may open it or enter through it, since Yahweh, the God of Israel, has passed through it. Therefore, it must remain shut.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The prince, and only the prince, may sit inside the gateway to eat his sacred meal in the presence of Yahweh. He must enter and leave through the porch of the gate of the outer courtyard.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then the shining man led me through the north gate to the front of the temple. And I looked and behold, I saw Yahweh ’s glory cloud filling the temple. And I was awestruck and fell facedown to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, set your heart on what I am about to tell you. Look closely and listen carefully to everything I explain regarding all the laws and instructions about my temple. Pay careful attention to the entrance to the temple and all the exits from the sanctuary.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And tell the rebels among the people of Israel, ‘Lord Yahweh says to you: Enough of all your despicable deeds, you people of Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="7">You have desecrated my temple by admitting gentiles into my sanctuary who are uncircumcised in heart and body, allowing them into my presence while you offer the fat and blood of sacrifices to me. You have broken my covenant in addition to all the wicked things you have done.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Instead of keeping charge of my holy things yourselves, you have placed these gentiles in charge of my sanctuary.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Lord Yahweh says, “No gentile, uncircumcised in heart and body, may enter my sanctuary, even the foreigners living among the Israelites.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For the Levites who abandoned me when Israel turned their backs on me to worship their false gods must bear the consequences of their own sin.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They may serve me in my sanctuary by being temple gatekeepers and temple servants. They may kill the animals the people bring to offer as burnt offerings and sacrifices for the people and by serving the worshipers in the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But because they assisted the people of Israel in the worship of their idols and thereby caused them to sin, I, Lord Yahweh, solemnly swear that they will suffer for their sin.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They will never draw near to me again to fulfill the priestly office in my presence, nor will they ever again touch my holy things—my very, very holy things! They must bear the shame and disgrace of their despicable deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will, however, assign them the responsibility of performing temple duties in the outer court. I will make them responsible for serving the temple and the work to be done in it.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh says, “The Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who faithfully served in my sanctuary when the rest of the Israelites strayed far from me, they will come near to me to minister to me. I, Lord Yahweh, declare that they will stand in my presence to offer the sacrifices of fat and blood.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They will enter my sanctuary and approach my table to minister to me and to oversee the temple worship.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“When the Zadokite priests enter the gates of the inner court, they must be wearing linen garments. They are not allowed to wear any wool clothing when they are on duty inside the inner court or in the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Their turbans and undergarments must all likewise be of linen. They are not to wear anything that makes them perspire.</verse>
				<verse number="19">When they finish their sacred duties, before they go out to mingle with the people in the outer court, they must remove their priestly garments they ministered in and leave them in the holy chamber rooms. They then must put on regular clothes so that they will not transmit holiness to the people through their sacred garments.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“The priests must not shave their heads nor let their hair grow long, but must keep it properly trimmed.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Priests must not drink wine before they enter the inner court.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“They may not marry a widow or a divorced woman but only an Israelite virgin. They may, however, marry a widow if she is the widow of a priest.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“They must teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is ordinary and make them understand the difference between what is ritually clean for God’s service and what is ritually unacceptable.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“If a dispute arises, the priests will judge it consistent with my laws. They must follow my instructions and regulations for all my appointed feasts and honor my holy Sabbaths.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“A priest must not defile himself by going near a dead person; however, if the dead person was his father or mother, son or daughter, brother, or unmarried sister, then he may defile himself.</verse>
				<verse number="26">After his purification, he must wait seven days.</verse>
				<verse number="27">And the first day he goes back into the inner court to minister in the Holy Place, he must offer his sin offering. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Yahweh says of the priests, “I will be their sole inheritance. You are not to give them any possession in Israel, for I alone am their sole possession.</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Their food will be the grain offering, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings. Everything dedicated by vow to God in Israel will be theirs.</verse>
				<verse number="30">All the best fruits of every kind and all the offerings that the people give to God must go to the priests. And you must also give the first portion of the grain you grind into flour to the priests so that a blessing may rest on your house.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Priests must not eat any bird or animal that has died a natural death or that wild animals have killed.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="45">
				<verse number="1">“When you apportion the land as an inheritance to each tribe, you must set aside a sacred portion for Yahweh. It is to be 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits wide. The entire area of this land will be sacred.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And inside this area, a square plot of land 500 cubits by 500 cubits must be set apart for the temple compound. All around the temple compound there will be a strip of open land that is 50 cubits wide on each side.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Within this sacred portion you must mark off an area that is 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide. This is the area set apart for the temple, the Holy of Holies.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“This dedicated part of the land will be for the priests who minister before Yahweh in his sanctuary. It will be for the priests’ houses and for the holy precincts of the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The other half of the area, a section 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide, will be owned by the Levites who minister at the temple, with towns for them to live in.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You must assign an area 25,000 cubits long by 5,000 cubits wide, adjacent to the land belonging to my sanctuary. This will belong to all the people of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">“The prince will have land on both sides of the holy area and the city. West of the holy area and the city, his land will reach to the Mediterranean Sea. East of the holy area and the city, his land will reach to the eastern border of the country. It will correspond in length to the land given to each tribe.</verse>
				<verse number="8">This will be the prince’s property in Israel. Then my leaders will no longer bully and oppress my people. They will permit the people of Israel to live peacefully and possess the rest of the country for its tribes.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Lord Yahweh says this: “You have overstepped your bounds, you leaders of Israel! Stop your violence and oppression and start practicing justice and righteousness. I, Lord Yahweh, say to you: Do what is right and just, and stop forcing people from their homes so that you can take their property.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You must have accurate scales and a true standard of measurement for grains (known as an ephah) and for liquids (known as a bath).</verse>
				<verse number="11">The measurement of an ephah and bath must be equal, and each will be one-tenth of a homer, the bath and the ephah one-tenth of a homer. The standard for measuring will be based on the homer.</verse>
				<verse number="12">A shekel is to consist of twenty gerahs. A mina is to consist of sixty shekels.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“These are the things you must bring as an offering to God: “One-sixtieth of your wheat, One-sixtieth of your barley,</verse>
				<verse number="14">One-hundredth of your olive oil, using the standard measurement known by all,</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then, one sheep (or goat) is to be taken from every flock of two hundred livestock from the well-watered pastures of Israel. “I, Lord Yahweh, declare that these offerings will be for grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for the people.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“All the people of the land will be required to give these offerings to the prince of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The prince will be responsible to provide the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the drink offerings for feasts, new moons, Sabbaths, and all the appointed feasts of the people of Israel. The prince must provide the sacrifice for sin, the grain offering, the burnt offering, and the fellowship offerings to make atonement for the people of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Lord Yahweh says: “On the first day of each new year, you must select a perfect young bull without blemish to sacrifice to purify the sanctuary.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The priest must take the blood of the sin offering and smear it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate to the inner courtyard.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You must do the same seven days later, on behalf of anyone who has sinned unintentionally or through ignorance. In this way you will purify the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Then seven days later, on the fourteenth day of the first month, you will observe the Passover Feast for seven days. During that time everyone must eat bread made without yeast.</verse>
				<verse number="22">On the first day of the feast, the prince must offer a bull as a sacrifice for sin, for himself and all the sins of the people of the land.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And on each of the seven days of the festival the prince will offer Yahweh a burnt offering of seven young bulls and seven rams without blemish or defect. And every day he will also offer a male goat to take away the sins of the people.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The prince must also offer one ephah of grain for each bull and each ram sacrificed. And he will also offer one hin of oil for each ephah.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">“On the fifteenth day of the seventh month and on each of the seven days of the Feast of Tabernacles, the prince must supply the provisions for the sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the oil.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="46">
				<verse number="1">Lord Yahweh says: “The east gate of the inner courtyard must remain closed for the six working days. However, on the Sabbath day and the day of the new moon, it will be open.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The prince must enter through the porch of the outer gate and stand by the posts of the gateway as the priests offer his burnt offering and his fellowship offering on his behalf. He must bow down and worship at the threshold of the gate. Then the prince will go out the same gate he entered, but the gate will remain open until evening.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Each Sabbath and each new moon, all the people of the land will bow down and worship in the presence of Yahweh at the entrance to the gate.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“On the Sabbath, I want the prince to bring to me six lambs and one ram, all without flaws, and the priests will burn them as an offering to me.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Additionally, I want the prince to also give me one ephah of grain with the ram as an offering and as much grain offering as he wants to give for each lamb, plus a hin of olive oil for every ephah of flour.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“On the day of the new moon, I want the prince to offer to me a young unblemished bull, six unblemished lambs, and one unblemished ram.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And with his offerings, I want him also to bring to me one ephah of grain for the bull and one ephah of grain for the ram, and as much flour and oil as he wants for the lambs, and a hin of oil for every ephah of grain.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“When the prince enters, he must enter and exit the outer courtyard by the porch of the gate.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“When the people of Israel come into my presence for the solemn festivals, the prince will be with them, coming in with them and going out with them. When they enter the outer courtyard, they will all go in from either the north side or south side of the temple. Those who have come in by the north gate to bow in worship must go out by the south gate, and those who have come in by the south gate must go out by the north gate. No one will turn around and leave through the same gate by which he entered, but they must go out on the opposite side.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">“On the feast days and solemn festivals the prince’s grain offering must be one ephah for every bull, one ephah for every ram, and as much as he wants for the lambs, and a hin of oil for every ephah of grain.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When the prince offers me a freewill burnt offering or a freewill fellowship sacrifice, the east gate must be opened for him, and he will make his offering as he does on the Sabbath day. When he leaves, the priests will shut the gate behind him.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Every day, he must provide a year-old flawless lamb as a burnt offering to me for the morning sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Additionally, every morning, he must provide a grain offering of one-sixth of an ephah and one-third hin of olive oil, to mix with the flour. This grain offering to me will be a lasting ordinance for all time.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Every single morning, the lamb, the grain, and the olive oil must be offered to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Lord Yahweh says: “If the prince gives a gift of his land to any of his sons, that land will belong to his descendants. It is their property by inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If, however, he gives part of his inheritance to one of his servants, it will belong to him until the year of liberty, and then it must return to the prince. Only he and his sons will own it permanently.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The prince may not evict anyone from their land or seize any part of the family property of any Israelite. He must provide an inheritance for his sons out of his own property so that no member of my people is robbed of what is his!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then the shining man took me through the entrance at the side of the north gate that leads to the priests’ holy chambers. And behold, there before us was a place at the western end of the rooms.</verse>
				<verse number="20">He said to me, “This is the kitchen where the priests must boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they must bake the grain offering without having to carry them into the outer court and inadvertently transmit holiness to the people.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then he brought me out to the outer court and led me to each of its four corners. And in each corner of the outer court was an enclosure.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Each enclosure in the corners was the same size, forty cubits by thirty cubits.</verse>
				<verse number="23">All four enclosures had stone shelves on the walls with built-in fireplaces all around the walls under the ledge.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then the shining man said to me, “These are the kitchens where the temple servants will cook the sacrifices the people offer.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="47">
				<verse number="1">Then the shining man brought me back to the entrance of the temple, and I saw water flowing from underneath the temple threshold. It was flowing eastward (for the temple faced east). Water was trickling out from the south side of the temple, south of the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then he took me out by the north gate and led me around the outside to the gate that faces east. And there I saw water flowing out on the right-hand side, south of the gateway.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The man holding his measuring line walked east and measured off a thousand cubits. Then he made me wade across the shallow water, and it was ankle deep.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He measured off another thousand cubits and told me to wade across the stream again; the water was up to my knees. He measured off another thousand cubits and made me wade across the stream again, and the water was up to my waist.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He measured off another thousand; it was now a river over my head, which I was unable to swim across. It was a deep swollen river—a river no one could cross.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The shining man said to me, “Son of man, do you see this?” Then he brought me back to the riverbank.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When I got there, I was astonished to see an enormous number of trees on each side of the river.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He said, “This water flows east, down to the Jordan Valley and to the Dead Sea. As it flows into the stagnant waters, that water becomes fresh water.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Wherever the river flows, all living creatures will live and thrive. Schools of fish will be very plentiful, for wherever the river goes, it brings healing, and everything will come alive!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Fishermen will crowd its banks and spread their nets from En-Gedi to En-Eglaim. They will catch as many species of fish as there are in the Great Sea.</verse>
				<verse number="11">However, its swamps and marshes will not become healed but will be left for salt.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Along both banks of the river, every kind of fruit tree will flourish. And their leaves will never wither, and abundant fruit will always be on their branches. Each month they will bear a fresh crop of fruit because this life-giving water comes from inside the sanctuary. And their fruit will be good to eat, and the leaves will bring healing.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, here are the territorial boundaries for your distribution of land among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall receive a double portion.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You will each have a fair share of it since I swore to your ancestors that I would give it to them. So now, this land will belong to you as family property.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“These will be the borders of the land. The northern border starts at the Mediterranean Sea and stretches east along the road to the town of Hethlon, through Hamath Pass, to the town of Zedad,</verse>
				<verse number="16">and then on to the towns of Berothah and Sibraim. These two towns are on the border between Damascus and Hamath. It will extend as far as Hazer-ha-Tikon, which is on the border of the region of Hauran.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So, your northern frontier will extend from the sea to Hazer-Enon, which is north of Damascus and the border of Hamath on the north.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“The Jordan River will serve as your eastern border between Hauran and Damascus, between Gilead and Israel, down to the Dead Sea as far south as Tamar.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Your southern border stretches west from Tamar southward to the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, following the dry riverbed to the Mediterranean Sea; that will be your southern border.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And your western boundary will follow the coast of the Mediterranean Sea from the southern border north to the point opposite Hamath Pass; that will be the western frontier.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Divide this land among the tribes of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="22">You must distribute it as an inheritance for yourselves and the resident aliens who live among you, who have their children among you, since you must treat them as citizens of Israel. They must receive a share of the land for their inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="23">In whatever tribe the resident alien resides, that is where you will assign his share. I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="48">
				<verse number="1">“This is the list of the tribes and the land they are to receive. The border follows the Hethlon road to the boundary between Damascus and Hamath. The territory for each tribe will extend all the way across the country from east to west. Starting from the north, the tribes are: Dan Asher Naphtali Manasseh Ephraim Reuben Judah.”</verse>

				<verse number="8">“South of Judah, from the eastern limit to the western limit, is the special portion of holy land that you must set aside. The temple complex will stand in the center. That land will be 25,000 cubits wide and the same length as one of the tribal portions from the east side to the west.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The portion that you must set aside for Yahweh must be 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits wide.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Here is how you will divide the sacred section of land. You will give the priests a portion of land that is 25,000 cubits in length and 10,000 cubits in width. The temple of Yahweh will stand inside this area in the center.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This will be for the sons of Zadok, the consecrated priests who faithfully served me. They did not join with the straying Israelites, as did the other Levites who went astray.</verse>
				<verse number="12">It will be a special gift to them from the sacred portion of the land, a most holy portion on the border of the Levites.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Alongside the border of the priests, the Levites’ portion will be 25,000 cubits in length and 10,000 cubits in width. The whole length will be 25,000 cubits and 10,000 cubits in width.</verse>
				<verse number="14">It is forbidden for them to sell or exchange any part of it. They are not to allow anyone else to own this special land, since it is consecrated to Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“The rest of the special area is 25,000 cubits long and 5,000 cubits wide. This must be for the common use of the city, for houses and pastures. In the middle will be the city of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The dimensions of the city will form a square with 4,500 cubits on each side.</verse>
				<verse number="17">There will be an open space of 250 cubits around the perimeter of the city.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“There will remain one strip of land along the sacred portion left over that will extend 10,000 cubits to the east of the city and 10,000 cubits to the west of the city. This portion will be used to grow food for the people who work in the city.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And the city workers, drawn from all the tribes of Israel, will farm it.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The entire portion of land you must set apart will have a total area of 25,000 cubits square, that is, the sacred portion of land for the temple together with the area for the city.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“This 25,000-cubit square will contain the holy portion of the priests, the Levites’ land, and the land where the city will be. It will be in the middle of the prince’s land, and he will have any land remaining on either side of the sacred portion and of the property of the city. The prince will have two sections, one stretching from the edge of this area to the eastern border of the country, the other stretching from the other edge of this area to the western border. These two sections of land belonging to the prince will run alongside the borders of the territories of Judah and Benjamin. It will lie between those two territories south of Judah and north of Benjamin.”</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23">“As regards the remaining tribes south of this sacred section, each tribe is to receive one portion of land that extends from the eastern boundary west to the Mediterranean Sea: Benjamin Simeon Issachar Zebulun Gad.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">It was the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, marched on Jerusalem and besieged the city.</verse>
				<verse number="2">My Lord gave Nebuchadnezzar victory over King Jehoiakim and permitted the Babylonian ruler to remove some of the sacred vessels belonging to the temple of the true God. Nebuchadnezzar carried them away to the land of Babylon and placed the sacred vessels into the temple treasury of his own gods.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Later, the king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief officer, to select a certain number of youths from royal or noble families of the Israelites</verse>
				<verse number="4">who would be suitable for service in the king’s palace. They were to be handsome young men without defect, well-versed in every branch of wisdom. They were to be intelligent, discerning, and qualified for royal service. Ashpenaz was instructed to teach them the culture, the literature, and the language of the Babylonians.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The king provided them a daily allowance of the best food and wine from the king’s table. For three years they were to receive a thorough education, after which they would enter the king’s service.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Among these men of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But the chief official of the palace gave them Babylonian names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.</verse>
				<verse number="8">However, Daniel determined in his heart not to contaminate himself with the food and wine from the royal table, so he begged the chief official to exempt him from the royal diet.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then God moved on the heart of the chief official to show Daniel favor and compassion.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But he warned Daniel, “My lord the king has ordered your meat and drink, and I fear that he will notice if your face starts looking worse than the other men your age. You could put my life in jeopardy with the king.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Daniel then appealed to the overseer whom the chief officer put in charge over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Daniel said to him,</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Test us, your servants, for ten days. Give us only seeds to eat and water to drink.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then afterward, compare our appearance with those of the young men who eat the king’s food. Then you can decide what to do with us.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">So the overseer agreed to do what they requested and tested them for ten days.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And when the ten days were completed, they looked healthier and had even gained weight. The four Hebrew young men were in better physical condition compared to any of the others who had eaten their food from the royal table.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So the guard replaced their diet of royal food and wine with vegetables and water.</verse>
				<verse number="17">God imparted insight and skill in every aspect of literature and science to the four Hebrew men. Daniel also had the unique gift of interpreting every kind of supernatural vision and dream.</verse>
				<verse number="18">At the end of the period that the king had assigned for their training, the chief of the palace servants brought them to Nebuchadnezzar’s court.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The king interviewed them all, and among all the young men, he found none to equal Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So, the king chose them to serve as his advisers.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And when the king questioned them on any point of wisdom or understanding, he found them ten times superior to all the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And Daniel continued there in Babylon as a royal adviser until the time Cyrus became king.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had an ominous dream. It left him so disturbed that he could not sleep.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So the king called for his magicians, enchanters, wizards, and wise men to tell him what he had dreamed. And they all came and stood before the unsettled king.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He told them, “I’ve had a dream, and my heart is troubled. I want to know what my dream means.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">The wise men answered him in Aramaic: “May you live forever, O king! Tell your servants the dream you had, and we will gladly reveal its meaning for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">“My decision is final,” the king answered. “If you cannot tell me what I dreamed and what it means, I will have you torn limb from limb and turn your homes into garbage dumps.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But if you can tell me what I dreamed and its interpretation, I will reward you with wonderful gifts and high honor in my kingdom. So now, tell me my dream and what it means.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">They again replied, “Let the king tell his dream to us his servants, and we will gladly reveal its meaning.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But the king retorted, “I know what you’re doing; you’re just stalling for time! My decision is firm.</verse>
				<verse number="9">If you do not interpret my dream for me, you will all receive the same punishment. You have conspired to continue deceiving me with your lies, hoping something will change. So, tell me now what I dreamed so that I can be assured that you are able to interpret it for me.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">The wise men answered the king, “There is no one on earth who could do what Your Majesty commands. Furthermore, no king great or small has ever requested such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or astrologer.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Your Majesty, what you ask is difficult, and it is impossible for anyone to reveal it except the gods, and they do not live with mortals.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">At this the king flew into a violent rage and ordered all the wise men of Babylon to be executed.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When the king’s decree was issued to have all the wise men killed, a search was also made for Daniel and his companions to have them put to death.</verse>
				<verse number="14">As Arioch, captain of the royal bodyguard, set out to execute the wise men of Babylon, Daniel cautiously and tactfully approached</verse>
				<verse number="15">this royal official and asked him, “Why has the king issued such a harsh decree?” When Arioch explained all that had transpired,</verse>
				<verse number="16">Daniel immediately went off to plead with the king for more time so that he could seek the interpretation of the king’s dream.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Daniel then went home and explained everything to his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He urged them to beg the God of heaven for mercy to help them unravel the mysterious secret of the king’s dream so that Daniel and his friends would not be executed with the other Babylonian wise men.</verse>
				<verse number="19">That night, God clearly revealed to Daniel in a night vision the mystery of the dream. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven,</verse>
				<verse number="20">saying, “May the blessed name of God be praised forever and ever, for wisdom and might are his alone.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He alone controls the changes of times and seasons. He enthrones and dethrones kings, he imparts wisdom to the wise, and he pours out revelation-knowledge to those with understanding.</verse>
				<verse number="22">He alone reveals deep secrets and mysteries and knows what lies in darkness, for he radiates glory-light all around him.</verse>
				<verse number="23">You are the God worshiped by all my ancestors; I give you thanks and praise, for you have given me wisdom and power! You have revealed to us the king’s dream and unraveled to me its meaning.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then Daniel went back to see Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not kill the wise men. Take me into the king’s presence, and I will reveal the dream’s meaning to the king.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Without wasting a moment, Arioch escorted Daniel to see the king. Arioch said to Nebuchadnezzar, “Your Majesty, I have found one of the Jewish exiles who can reveal the meaning of your troublesome dream.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">The king said to Daniel (whose Babylonian name was Belteshazzar), “ Is this true? Can you tell me what I dreamed and what it means?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Daniel replied, “None of the wise men, enchanters, magicians, or astrologers are able to unveil the mystery you have asked about,</verse>
				<verse number="28">but there is an all-knowing God in heaven who reveals the deepest mysteries. Your Majesty, he is the one who has revealed to you what is to take place in the last days. Here is your dream, the vision that filled your mind as you lay in your bed:</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Your Majesty, as you were going to sleep, your thoughts turned to what would happen in the future. The Revealer of Mysteries has disclosed future events to you.</verse>
				<verse number="30">This mystery has been revealed to me not because I am wiser than anyone else but for one divine purpose: so that you, the king, should learn what it means and that you would understand your innermost thoughts.</verse>
				<verse number="31">“Your Majesty, you saw standing before you a huge statue of a man. It was both dazzling and terrifying to behold!</verse>
				<verse number="32">The head of this statue was of purest gold, its chest and arms were of gleaming silver, its belly and hips of polished bronze,</verse>
				<verse number="33">its legs of iron, and its feet were partly iron and partly clay.</verse>
				<verse number="34">While you were staring at this statue, a boulder broke off from a mountain but not by the instrument of human hands. The boulder struck the statue at its base and shattered its feet of iron and clay into pieces.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then, all at once, the entire statue collapsed into a heap of rubble. The iron and clay, bronze, silver, and gold were all pulverized as fine as chaff on the summer threshing-floor. The wind blew the shattered pieces away, leaving not a trace behind. But the boulder that hit the statue grew into a massive mountain that covered the whole earth.</verse>
				<verse number="36">This was your dream. And now, we will explain to the king what it means.</verse>
				<verse number="37">“Your Majesty, you are the greatest of kings. The God of heaven has bestowed upon you royal authority, power, might, and honor.</verse>
				<verse number="38">He has handed over to you people, beasts, and birds, wherever they live, making you king of them all. You, O king, are the golden head.</verse>
				<verse number="39">“And after you are gone, another kingdom will arise, a kingdom not as great as yours. And then a third kingdom will arise to rule the land, a kingdom of bronze.</verse>
				<verse number="40">“And there will be a fourth kingdom, strong and hard as iron. It will shatter all things in its way. Like iron that breaks everything to pieces, it will crush and break all the other kingdoms.</verse>
				<verse number="41">“The feet and toes you saw, partly of iron and partly of clay, represent a divided kingdom that will retain some of the iron’s strength, just as you saw the iron and the clay mixed together.</verse>
				<verse number="42">That its feet and toes were partly iron and partly clay means that this kingdom will be both strong and fragile.</verse>
				<verse number="43">And just as you saw the iron and the clay mingled together, so the people of this kingdom will seek to be united, but they will not bond any more than iron will permanently bond with clay.</verse>
				<verse number="44">“In the days of those kings of iron and clay, the God of heaven will set up an eternal kingdom that will never be destroyed nor ruled by other people. It will shatter and bring all other kingdoms to an end, and it will stand forever!</verse>
				<verse number="45">This is the meaning of what you saw in your vision: a rock cut out of a mountain—but not by human hands—a rock that shattered the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold to pieces is his eternal kingdom. The Great God has revealed to you, the king, what will take place after this. The dream is true, and its interpretation trustworthy.”</verse>
				<verse number="46">Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed low to the ground in awe of Daniel. Then he gave orders for incense to be burned and a sacrifice of grain to be offered in Daniel’s honor.</verse>
				<verse number="47">The king said to Daniel, “Your god is without question the God of all gods, the Master of all kings, and the Revealer of all mysteries since he has given you the revelation of this mystery.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">Then the king promoted Daniel and made him great in the kingdom and gave him many wonderful gifts. He also made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and the chief of all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="49">At Daniel’s request, the king delegated the affairs of the province of Babylon to his friends Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Daniel remained in the king’s palace.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">King Nebuchadnezzar had a golden statue made that was sixty cubits high and six cubits wide. He erected the statue on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He then ordered an assembly of his princes, magistrates, and governors, as well as the counselors, treasurers, judges, sheriffs, and all the other provincial authorities, that they should be present at the dedication of the statue he had erected.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So all these officials gathered in front of the golden statue that the king had made.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then a herald made the loud proclamation: “ Attention everyone! Listen to what the king commands of you—you of every nation and language.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When you hear the ram’s horn, and the music of the flute, the lyre, the ten-stringed harp, the triangular harp, the drums, and all the other instruments, you will bow down to the ground and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has made.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Whoever does not bow down to worship it will immediately be thrown into a white-hot fiery furnace.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Therefore, at the set time, as soon as they heard the musical instruments, those present from all nations and languages bowed down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
				<verse number="8">At that point, certain Babylonian astrologers approached the king and maliciously denounced the Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They said to King Nebuchadnezzar: “O king, live forever!</verse>
				<verse number="10">You issued a royal decree, O king, that when everyone hears the ram’s horn and the music begins they must bow down to the ground and worship the golden image.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And whoever does not bow down and worship it will be thrown inside a white-hot fiery furnace.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yet, the prominent Jews, whom you have appointed administrators of the province of Babylon, have greatly disrespected you, Your Majesty. Their names are Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They do not serve your gods nor worship the golden image you have set up.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Upon hearing this, King Nebuchadnezzar flew into a furious rage and ordered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to be brought before him. When these men came before the king,</verse>
				<verse number="14">he asked them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden statue that I erected?</verse>
				<verse number="15">I now give you one more chance. When you hear the ram’s horn and the music of the flute, the lyre, the ten-stringed harp, the triangular harp, the drums, and all the other instruments, you will bow down to the ground and worship the golden statue I have made. But if you refuse to worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a white-hot fiery furnace. So now, who is the god that can save you from my power?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered King Nebuchadnezzar: “We have no need to offer you a defense in this matter.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If the God we serve truly exists, then he will save us from death at your hand, O king. So, if you throw us into the fiery furnace, our God is able to save us.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But even if he does not save us, you can be sure, O king, that we would not serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have erected.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Upon hearing this, Nebuchadnezzar was filled with anger, and his face was distorted with rage against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered his men to heat the fiery furnace seven times hotter than it usually was.</verse>
				<verse number="20">He also commanded some of his mighty men to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the white-hot furnace.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Immediately, they tied up the three men while they still had on all their clothes—their trousers, shirts, and turbans—and then threw them into the white-hot furnace.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But because the king’s command was so urgent and the furnace so overheated, the raging flames burned up the men who carried Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And the three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, tied and bound, fell inside the blazing, white-hot furnace.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Suddenly King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement and asked his officials, “Didn’t we throw three men, bound in fetters, into the fire?” “That is correct, Your Majesty,” they answered him.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“But look,” he shouted, “I see four men walking about freely in the fire. They’re all unharmed! And the fourth man has the appearance of a son of the gods!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar cautiously approached the opening of the white-hot blazing furnace and shouted, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Great God, come out here now!” So out of the midst of the fire walked Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego completely unharmed.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When all the kings’ officials had assembled, along with the princes, magistrates, and governors, they discovered that the fire had not harmed these three men. Their hair was not singed, their clothes were not scorched, and they didn’t even smell like smoke.</verse>
				<verse number="28">King Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! For he sent his divine messenger to rescue his servants who trusted in him. They disobeyed my orders and laid their lives on the line rather than serve or worship any god but their own.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So I hereby make this decree: Any person from any nation or language who says anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be torn limb from limb, and his house will be destroyed, because there is no other god who is able to rescue so miraculously!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">King Nebuchadnezzar, to all peoples, nations, and language groups in the land: “I wish you perfect peace and prosperity!</verse>
				<verse number="2">It is my royal pleasure to inform you of the mighty signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.</verse>
				<verse number="3">“How great are his signs! How overwhelming are his wonders! His kingdom will last forever, and his dominion endures from one generation to the next.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">“I, Nebuchadnezzar, was content and at peace in my house—thoroughly enjoying a life of luxury in my palace.</verse>
				<verse number="5">One night, I had a terrifying dream. While I was lying on my bed, frightening visions passed through my head, and I was tormented by what I saw.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So I issued a decree that all the sages of Babylon must come and explain to me what my dream meant.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Magicians, enchanters, wizards, and wise men came, and I explained my dream to them, but they were unable to interpret it for me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Finally, Daniel came before me. (I had renamed him Belteshazzar, after my own god.) The spirit of the holy gods resides in him. I then told Daniel my dream:</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Belteshazzar, chief of all my wise men, I know that the spirit of the holy gods resides in you and that there is no mystery that you cannot solve. So, listen to my dream and tell me what it means.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“While I slept, these visions passed through my mind: I saw a huge tree in the midst of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And the tree grew taller and stronger until its top reached into the heavens, and it could be seen from the far reaches of the land.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Its branches and foliage were beautiful, its fruit abundant, providing enough food for all. Animals rested under its shade, and birds found shelter in its sturdy branches. All living creatures were nourished from it.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“While I was still asleep, I saw another vision: I saw a watcher, a holy one, come down from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="14">At the top of his voice, he announced: ‘Cut down the tree, lop off its branches, strip off its leaves, and scatter its fruit. Drive away the animals from beneath its shelter and the birds from its branches.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But leave the stump with its roots in the ground. Encircle it with chains of iron and bronze, surrounded by the grass of the field. Night after night, let him be damp with heaven’s dew. Let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth as his appointed lot. Let him eat the grass of the field.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For seven years, let his mind be altered into the mind of a beast.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Such is the sentence decreed by the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones, so that everyone living may learn that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men. He can give them to whomever he pleases and raises up over them the lowliest of all people.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then King Nebuchadnezzar concluded, “That was my dream. Now it is for you, Belteshazzar, to interpret its meaning, since not one of the wise men in my kingdom has been able to interpret it for me, but I know that you can, since the spirit of the holy gods resides in you.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Upon hearing this, Daniel (known as Belteshazzar) was visibly shaken for a while and troubled in his thoughts. The king noticed this and said to him, “Belteshazzar, do not be alarmed by the dream and its meaning.” Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, if only the dream applied to those who hate you and its interpretation were for your enemies!</verse>
				<verse number="20">The huge tree you saw, so large and tall that it reached into the heavens and could be seen from anywhere in the land,</verse>
				<verse number="21">the tree with beautiful branches and foliage and abundant fruit, providing food for all and shade for the wild animals, and birds with nests in its branches:</verse>
				<verse number="22">that tree, Your Majesty, is you! You are now so great and strong that it reaches into heaven, and your authority reaches over the entire land.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“Now you, O king, saw a watcher—a holy messenger—come down from heaven, saying, ‘Cut the tree down and destroy it, but leave the stump and roots in the ground. Encircle it with chains of iron and bronze in the midst of the grass of the field. Let him be damp with the dew every night. Let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth as his appointed lot until seven years have passed by for him.’</verse>
				<verse number="24">So, the meaning of what you saw, Your Majesty, and the decree the Most High has decreed over you, my lord the king, is this:</verse>
				<verse number="25">“You will be driven far from human society and will make your home with the wild beasts for seven years. Like cattle, you will eat grass, and you will be damp with the dew of heaven, until you have learned that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and can give them to whomever he pleases.</verse>
				<verse number="26">“And the watcher’s order, ‘Leave the stump with its roots in the ground,’ means this: God will restore your kingdom to you once you come to your senses and understand that Heaven rules over all.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Your Majesty, please be willing to do what I say and accept my advice. Renounce your sins by doing what is right. Turn from your wickedness by showing mercy to the poor and unfortunate, and perhaps your prosperity will continue.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">All that was predicted happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
				<verse number="29">A year later, while strolling on the roof of his royal palace in Babylon,</verse>
				<verse number="30">the king began to boast: “ Look at you! Is not this Babylon the great? By my brilliant wisdom, I built all this as my royal residence to display the glory of my majesty.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">The words were no sooner out of his mouth than a voice spoke from out of heaven: “Here is my verdict concerning you, King Nebuchadnezzar: I have now taken your kingdom from you!</verse>
				<verse number="32">You will be driven far from human society for seven years. You will make your home with the wild beasts, and you will eat grass like cattle until you have learned that I, the Most High, am sovereign over the kingdoms of men and can give them to whomever I please.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">It was no sooner said than done: Nebuchadnezzar was forced to live like a wild animal and was driven far from human society and ate grass as cattle do. Night after night he was damp with the dew of heaven, his hair grew remarkably long like eagle’s feathers, and his nails became like a bird’s talons.</verse>
				<verse number="34">“When the appointed time had come, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes to heaven, and my sanity returned to me. And I blessed the Most High, praising and glorifying him who lives forever: “His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion endures from one generation to the next.</verse>
				<verse number="35">All who dwell on earth are regarded as nothing compared to him. He does whatever he pleases with the armies of heaven and with those who dwell on earth. No one can restrain his mighty hand or dare ask him, ‘What are you doing?’</verse>
				<verse number="36">At the moment I began to praise him, I was restored to my right mind. The Most High gave me back the majesty and splendor of my kingdom. My advisers and noblemen came looking for me. I was restored to my throne, and still more greatness was added to me.</verse>
				<verse number="37">And now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, extol, and glorify God, the King of heaven! All his works are right and true, and all his ways are right. He knows how to humble those who strut around in pride.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">When Belshazzar was king, he invited a thousand of his nobles to a state banquet, where the wine flowed freely among all his guests.</verse>
				<verse number="2">While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver vessels that his predecessor Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple of Jerusalem. He was wanting to drink from them along with all his guests—his nobles, his wives, and his concubines.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So they brought in the sacred gold vessels that were seized from the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king, his nobles, his wives, and his concubines all drank from them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">As they all drank their wine, they praised their man-made gods of gold and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then all at once, a human hand appeared out of thin air, and its finger began writing on the white-washed wall of the palace, illuminated by the lampstand nearby. When the king witnessed this strange hand as it was writing,</verse>
				<verse number="6">terror gripped him! The color drained from his face, his knees began to knock together, and he wet himself.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The king shouted out, “Bring in the astrologers, wise men, and enchanters.” And when they came before him, he said to all the wise ones of Babylon, “I will make rich and famous anyone who can read this handwriting on the wall and tell me its interpretation. He will wear the purple robes of royalty and wear a golden collar on his neck, and I will make him the third highest ruler in my kingdom.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">All the king’s wise men came forward to examine the wall, but not one could read the writing or tell the king what it meant.</verse>
				<verse number="9">King Belshazzar grew more and more terrified, his face turned ashen, and all his nobles were dumbfounded.</verse>
				<verse number="10">When the queen mother heard the uproar among the king and his nobles, she entered the banquet hall and said, “Long live the king! Do not be so alarmed. Why are you so pale?</verse>
				<verse number="11">There is a mighty man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. During your predecessor’s reign, he was found to have light, brilliant insight, and godlike wisdom. It was, in fact, your predecessor King Nebuchadnezzar, who made him chief of the wise men, enchanters, astrologers, and diviners.</verse>
				<verse number="12">This man Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, has an extraordinary spirit and is full of revelation and understanding. He possesses a rare ability to interpret dreams, unravel mysteries, and find solutions to impossible problems. So send for Daniel, and he will reveal to you what this handwriting means.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Daniel was brought into the presence of King Belshazzar, and the king asked him, “So, you are the Daniel of the Jewish exiles my predecessor brought here from Judah?</verse>
				<verse number="14">I have heard so much about you. I’ve been told that you have the Spirit of God and that you possess divine illumination, brilliant insight, and extraordinary wisdom.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Now, I have already brought in my wise men and astrologers before me, that they might read this inscription and give me its interpretation, but they were unable to show me what the words mean.</verse>
				<verse number="16">However, I have heard that you are able to interpret dreams and that you have solutions for impossible problems. If you, then, can read the handwriting and tell me what it means, you will wear purple robes of royalty and a golden collar on your neck, and you will become the third most powerful ruler in the kingdom.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then Daniel answered the king, “You may keep your rewards or give your gifts to someone else. But I will clear up for you the mystery of this handwriting on the wall.</verse>
				<verse number="18">As for you, O king, the Most High God gave your predecessor Nebuchadnezzar kingship, greatness, honor, and majesty.</verse>
				<verse number="19">God made him so great that people everywhere—people from every nation, tribe, and language group—trembled with fear and dread of him. He killed or spared whomever he pleased, and he exalted or humbled whomever he wished.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But when his heart was inflated with pride and his spirit hardened into stubbornness, God deposed him from his royal throne and stripped him of his glory.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He was driven away from civilization, for his mind became like that of a beast. He lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like an ox. His body was bathed with the dew of heaven until finally he acknowledged that the Most High God has dominion over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Yet you, his successor Belshazzar, you have not humbled your heart even though you knew all this.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Instead, you lifted yourself up above the sovereign Lord of the heavens. And you brought into your banquet hall the vessels of his temple so that you and your nobles, your wives, and your concubines might drink wine from them. You lifted praises to your gods of gold and silver, of bronze and iron, of wood and stone, who do not see or hear or know anything; but the God who controls your very life breath and every move you make you did not glorify.</verse>
				<verse number="24">This is why God sent the hand that wrote the inscription upon the wall.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“The words inscribed are: Mene***, Mene***, Teqel***, Parsin***.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And here is what they mean: “ Mene***: God has numbered*** the days of your reign and brought it to an end.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“ Teqel***: God has weighed*** you in the balance, and you have been found lacking.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“ Peres***: God has divided up*** your kingdom and given it to the Medes and the Persians.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Immediately Belshazzar ordered Daniel to be clothed in a royal purple robe, to have a golden collar placed around his neck, and to be proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="30">That very night, the Babylonian King Belshazzar was killed.</verse>
				<verse number="31">So Darius the Mede received the kingdom when he was sixty-two years old.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">After he became king, Darius the Mede decided to subdivide his kingdom into 120 provinces and strategically appointed a governor for each province.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He also appointed three chief officials to watch over the work of these governors so that the king’s interests might not suffer, and Daniel was one of these three.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now Daniel had an extraordinary spirit and possessed exceptional qualities. He so distinguished himself among all the chief officials and the governors that Darius intended to set him over his entire kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For that reason, the chief officials and the governors were stirred to seek some pretext against Daniel regarding his governmental affairs. But because he was trustworthy, no one could find any error or fault in him nor could they uncover any negligence or misconduct.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Finally, his accusers said to themselves, “We will never find grounds for accusation against this Daniel unless it is related to his obedience to the law of his God.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So these 122 powerful politicians consulted together as a group to entrap Daniel. And they went to speak to the king and said to him, “King Darius, live forever!</verse>
				<verse number="7">All the officials of your kingdom—your high officials, administrators, advisers, and governors—we are all agreed that by royal decree the following prohibition should be enforced strictly: for thirty days, no one is to pray to any god or man except to you, O king; otherwise, he must be thrown into the lions’ den.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now therefore, let the king issue this written, irrevocable decree that cannot be altered according to the unchanging law of the Medes and the Persians.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">So King Darius signed the written decree.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Even after Daniel learned that the king had officially signed his decree, he continued his regular custom of praying at three set times a day. He went to the upper chamber of his house and opened the windows facing toward Jerusalem. Then he got down on his knees to pray, and he offered his grateful praise to God as he always had done.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then all those who conspired against Daniel came and spied on him. They found him praying to God and asking him for help.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So they approached the king and reminded him of his royal decree: “ Your Majesty, did you not sign a decree forbidding everyone for thirty days to pray to any god or man except to you, O king, under penalty of being thrown into the lions’ den?” “ Yes, I did, and my decree is final,” the king answered. “It is irrevocable according to the law of the Medes and Persians.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">They then told the king, “ We discovered that Daniel, one of the foreign Jewish exiles, pays no heed to you, O king, and ignores the decree you have signed. For he prays to his God three times a day.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">When King Darius heard this, he was deeply grieved and sought to find a way he could rescue Daniel from his fate. For most of that day until sundown, he wrestled within himself over how Daniel could be spared.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But these powerful politicians went back to see the king and insisted, “Bear in mind, Your Majesty, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians, every edict or decree of the king is irrevocable.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So, the king gave orders to have Daniel brought in and cast into the lions’ den. But before they threw him into the lions’ den, the king said to Daniel, “Your God, whom you serve so faithfully, he will surely come to rescue you.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">A large stone was then brought and placed over the opening of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of each of his nobles so that Daniel’s fate might not be changed.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then the king returned to his palace, where he spent the night fasting; he had no supper brought to him and could not sleep a wink.</verse>
				<verse number="19">At the first sign of dawn, the king rose from his bed and hurried off to the lions’ den.</verse>
				<verse number="20">As he drew near the den of lions, he called out to Daniel with a trembling voice: “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve so faithfully, been able to rescue you from the lions?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then he heard a voice; it was Daniel—he was still alive! “O king, live forever,” answered Daniel.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“My God sent his angel, who sealed the mouths of the lions. I am unharmed and without a scratch. For I have been found innocent before my God and before you, too, O king. I have committed no wrong.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">The king was beside himself with joy! And he gave orders to have Daniel taken up out of the lions’ den. When the servants brought him up from the den, they could find no trace of injury on his body because he had trusted in his God.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then at the king’s command, those politicians who had maliciously plotted against Daniel, along with their wives and children, were arrested and flung into the lions’ den. And before they reached the bottom, the lions pounced on them and devoured them, bones and all.</verse>
				<verse number="25">After that, King Darius wrote the following to all the people groups of his kingdom, those of every nation, tribe, and tongue throughout the land: “May peace and prosperity be greatly multiplied to you!</verse>
				<verse number="26">I hereby decree that throughout my royal dominion, all people everywhere will tremble in fear before the God whom Daniel worships. He is the living God, enduring forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed, and his dominion continues without end.</verse>
				<verse number="27">He is a mighty savior and deliverer. He performs astonishing miracles in heaven and on earth, He alone has rescued Daniel from the claws of the lions.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">From then on, Daniel prospered greatly during the reign of Darius and during the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">During the first year of the reign of King Belshazzar of Babylon, I, Daniel, had a dream filled with visions while I lay on my bed. So, I wrote down my dream, describing in full all that I had seen.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Suddenly, in my night vision, I saw the four winds of the heavens burst forth upon the great sea.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then emerging from the tossing sea came four immense beasts, each different from the others.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The first one was like a winged lion, with wings like an eagle. As I watched, its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth, standing on two feet like a person, and it was given a human heart.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the second beast I saw resembled a bear. It was half crouching and had three ribs clenched between its fangs. It was told, “Stand up and devour more flesh.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">After that, as I looked on, behold, there was another one that looked like a tiger. On its back were four large wings of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority for dominion.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then in my night vision, behold, I saw a fourth beast! It was dreadful, terrifying, and incredibly powerful. It had huge iron teeth used for crushing and devouring its victims. With its massive feet it trampled on what was left. It had ten horns and was totally different from the other beasts.</verse>
				<verse number="8">As I was wondering about the horns, suddenly, another little horn sprouted up among them and tore out by the roots three of the previous horns to make room for it. On this little horn there were eyes like that of a man and a mouth boasting arrogantly.</verse>
				<verse number="9">As I looked on, I observed a heavenly courtroom. Various thrones were being arranged until the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow, and his hair was white like perfectly clean wool. His throne was a tempest of fiery flames, set upon wheels of blazing fire.</verse>
				<verse number="10">A surging stream of fire flowed from before him. Immeasurable numbers of people were serving him, and countless myriads were attending him. The court convened for judgment, and the books were opened.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As I kept on looking, I heard boastful words being spoken by the little horn. As I watched, the verdict was issued. The fourth beast was killed, and its body was thrown into the blazing fire.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion had been taken away, but they were allowed to continue living for an appointed time.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then, as I was looking on in my night visions, suddenly I saw one like a son of man coming in the midst of the clouds of heaven. He was ushered into the presence of the Ancient of Days and presented before him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then the Ancient of Days conferred upon him dominion, glory, and kingship. People of every nation and language group worshiped him. His dominion is everlasting and will never pass away, and his kingdom will never be destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="15">As for me, Daniel, I was terrified by these night visions, and my spirit was deeply disturbed by all that I saw.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I went up to one who was standing there and asked him to explain the true meaning of what I had witnessed. So he gave me the interpretation:</verse>
				<verse number="17">“These four great beasts represent four empires that will rise to power over the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But after them, the holy ones, the most high ones, will receive the kingdom and possess it forever. Yes, forever and ever!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">But I was curious to know more about the fourth beast. It was much different from all the others—the terrifying, dreadful beast. It crushed its victims with claws of bronze and with teeth of iron and then trampled on them.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Also, I wanted to know more about the ten horns on its head and the more prominent horn that sprouted up and uprooted three of the previous horns. I wanted to gain insight about this conspicuous little horn, more imposing than the others, with eyes in it and a mouth speaking arrogantly.</verse>
				<verse number="21">As I watched, that horn fought against the holy ones and was defeating them</verse>
				<verse number="22">until the Everlasting One came on the scene. He handed judgment over to the saints of the Most High, and dominion was given to the holy ones of the Most High. Then the time came when the holy ones took possession of the kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He gave me the interpretation: “The fourth beast means that there will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, different from all the other kingdoms. It will devour the whole earth, trample it down, and shatter it to pieces.</verse>
				<verse number="24">And the ten horns are ten kings that will arise from that fourth kingdom, and they will succeed each other. But after them, an eleventh king will rise to power. He will be different from the previous ones and will subdue three of those kings.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He will speak blasphemous words against the Most High and try to wear down the holy ones of the Most High. He will try to alter the set periods of time and change God’s decree, and the saints will be subjected to his power for a time, times, and half a time.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But when the heavenly court convenes, his ruling power will be stripped from him. His authority will be abolished and destroyed forever.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then the Most High will give to his holy ones the kingdom and the dominion and the grandeur of all the kingdoms on earth. All rulers and authorities will serve and obey him, for his kingdom is everlasting.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">That is all that I saw in my dream. I, Daniel, was so greatly terrified by my thoughts that my face turned pale, but I hid the vision in my heart.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, I, Daniel, saw a second supernatural vision.</verse>
				<verse number="2">In my vision I suddenly found myself in the fortress city of Susa, the capital of the province of Elam, standing beside the Ulai canal.</verse>
				<verse number="3">As I looked about, behold, I saw a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two long horns, one behind the other, but the one behind was longer.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I watched as the ram charged toward the west, then the north, and then the south. With each conquest, it became even more powerful. No beast could withstand it or be rescued from its power; it did whatever it pleased.</verse>
				<verse number="5">As I considered what it all meant, I saw a male goat come rushing from the west, racing across the whole earth without touching the ground. He had a single prominent horn on his forehead.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The goat came up to the two-horned ram that I saw standing beside the canal and rushed at it with savage force.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then I saw him reach the ram and attack it with furious blows. He smashed it so hard that it broke off its two horns, for the ram had no power to withstand it. The goat knocked the ram to the ground and trampled it down. And there was no one to rescue the ram from his power.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the goat grew exceedingly arrogant. At the very peak of his power, his big horn abruptly snapped off. In its place, four prominent horns came up, each pointing to a different direction.</verse>
				<verse number="9">From one of them, a small horn emerged. It eventually grew to be very big, and its power extended toward the south, the east, and toward the beautiful land.</verse>
				<verse number="10">It grew so powerful that it attacked the armies of heaven and hurled some of the starry host to the ground and trampled them down.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The horn arrogantly exalted itself against the Prince of the heavenly armies. It abolished the daily sacrifices, and the place of his sanctuary was defiled.</verse>
				<verse number="12">God’s people began to turn away from him and gave themselves to the power of the horn. Sin replaced the daily sacrifices on account of the rebellion of the people. The horn was successful in all it attempted to do; truth was cast down to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then I heard a holy one speaking. Another holy one asked the first one, the Wonderful Numberer, “How long will it be until this vision is fulfilled, in relation to the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, the handing over of the sanctuary, and the trampling underfoot of the host of God’s people?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">He answered, “For 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be purified.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">While I, Daniel, was pondering the vision I had seen, suddenly there appeared before me one who looked like a man.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then I heard the voice of someone calling out over the waters of the Ulai canal, “Gabriel, help this man understand the meaning of his vision.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">As the angel Gabriel came closer to where I was standing, I was so terrified that I fell facedown on the ground. Then he said to me, “ Daniel, son of man, you need to understand that your vision refers to the time of the end.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">When he spoke with me, I lost consciousness and passed out. But he took hold of me and raised me to my feet.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Listen,” he said, “and I will tell you what will take place in the time of wrath, for the vision pertains to the appointed time of the end:</verse>
				<verse number="20">“The ram that you saw with two long horns represents the kingdoms of the Medes and the Persians.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“The male goat represents the kingdoms of Greece, and the big horn on its forehead is the first king of the Greek Empire.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“As for the horn that was broken off and replaced by four prominent horns, this signifies that four other kingdoms will rise from its midst, but their combined power will not be as great as the first.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“When their reign comes to an end and their crimes have reached their full measure, there will arise a stern king, skilled in stubbornness and trickery.</verse>
				<verse number="24">He will grow in might but not through any power of his own. He will cause amazing devastation, succeed in every undertaking, and destroy mighty ones, the saints of the Most High.</verse>
				<verse number="25">By his cunning, he will make treachery succeed under his rule. In his own mind, he will highly exaggerate his own importance. When they are at ease, he will suddenly destroy many. But when he rises up against the Prince of all princes, he will be broken—but not by any human power.</verse>
				<verse number="26">“The explanation of the vision you had about the evening and morning sacrifices is absolutely true. And seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">I, Daniel, was dazed and lay sick for several days; then I got up and went back to serve the king. I was perplexed by the vision, for it seemed beyond understanding.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">These things happened during the first year Darius son of Xerxes was king over Babylon. He was a descendant of the Medes.</verse>
				<verse number="2">During his first year of rule, I, Daniel, was studying the Scriptures and noticed that according to the word Yahweh had revealed to the prophet Jeremiah, seventy years must pass while Jerusalem lay in ruins.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then I turned my heart to the Lord God, seeking an answer from him, pleading for mercy with fasting, wearing sackcloth, and sitting among ashes.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I prayed to Yahweh, my God, and made this confession: “My Lord, you are the great and awesome God who faithfully keeps your covenant of love with those who love you and keep your commands.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yet we have sinned, acted wickedly, and done evil; we have rebelled and turned aside from your laws and commands.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who prophesied in your name to our kings, our leaders, our fathers, and all the people of the land.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Righteousness belongs to you, Lord, but we are all covered with shame even to this day—the people of Judah, the residents of Jerusalem, and all Israel, near and far. You have scattered us to many lands because of our treachery against you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yes, Yahweh, we are all clothed with shame—our kings, our princes, and our fathers, because we have sinned against you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">In spite of all that, Lord, our God, you are filled with compassion and overflow with forgiveness, even though we have openly rebelled against you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“ Yahweh, we have not listened to your voice, our God, nor kept your instructions that you gave us through your servants the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="11">All the people of Israel have ignored your voice; we have defied your instructions and gone astray. Now, the solemn curses confirmed by your promises of punishment in the law of your servant Moses have been poured out upon us because we sinned against you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">You have fulfilled the words that you spoke against us and against the rulers over us by bringing upon us such a great calamity. Your severe punishment of Jerusalem has never been equaled under all heaven!</verse>
				<verse number="13">As the law of Moses warns, this calamity came upon us in full measure. And even now, Yahweh, we have not sought to please you, our God, by turning away from our wickedness and following your ways of truth.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yahweh, you have waited for the right moment to unleash this calamity upon us. Yahweh, our God, you are just and right in all that you have done, for we defiantly ignored your voice.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“And now, Lord our God, you delivered your people out of the land of Egypt with mighty power. You have won fame and gained renown for yourself even to this day. But we acknowledge our sin and wicked ways.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Lord, you have always demonstrated your faithfulness to Israel, so now please turn your fierce anger away from Jerusalem. It belongs to you and sits on the hill where sacrifice is made. All the other nations who live around us despise your city and your people because of the sins of our ancestors and because of our sins also.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And now, our God, I am your servant and I beg you, please—answer my prayers. Make your face to shine upon your ruined temple so that everyone will know that you are Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Turn your heart to hear my prayer, O my God. Listen to my cry and please look carefully and see our despair and the devastated city, which bears your name. We bring our requests to you and ask for your mercy, not because we deserve it but because of your extravagant, infinite love.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Lord, hear us and forgive us. Lord, please be attentive and act for us! Do not delay in answering us for your own sake, my God, and for your city and your people who bear your name.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">While I was absorbed in prayer, confessing my sins and the sins of my people Israel and presenting my request before Yahweh, my God, on behalf of Jerusalem, his holy hill—</verse>
				<verse number="21">Gabriel, whom I had seen in a vision previously, came flying down from heaven. He touched me at the time of the evening sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="22">He gave me understanding and said to me, “Daniel, I have come from heaven to impart insight and understanding concerning this prophecy.</verse>
				<verse number="23">As soon as you began to pray, God gave you an answer, for you are a precious treasure to God! Now, carefully consider the message and understand the revelation of the vision.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“God has decreed for your people and for the holy city a period of seventy times seven for these reasons: to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to cancel guilt, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to confirm the prophetic vision, and to anoint the Most Holy One.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“ You must know and understand this: From the issuing of God’s decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed Ruler comes, there will be seven ‘sevens,’ and sixty-two ‘sevens.’ Jerusalem will be rebuilt with broad streets and a trench, but during times of great distress.</verse>
				<verse number="26">“After those sixty-two weeks, the Anointed One will be cut off and left with nothing. The people of the commander will destroy both the city and the sanctuary. Then its end will come like an overwhelming flood, and until those sixty-two weeks end, there will be war. The decree of desolation has been issued!</verse>
				<verse number="27">“For one week he will confirm a covenant with many people, but in the middle of that week, he will abolish sacrifices and offerings. “On the wing of the temple, an appalling abomination will be erected. And the abomination will remain there until God does away with the one who placed it there, just as God has determined.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, I, Daniel, known as Belteshazzar, received a profound word—a true revelation, but I struggled to understand it. Finally, its interpretation was disclosed to me in a vision, and I began to understand the word.</verse>
				<verse number="2">At that time, I was in a period of mourning for three weeks.</verse>
				<verse number="3">During the entire three weeks, I ate no delicacies —no meat and no sweets. I drank no wine, nor did I groom myself.</verse>
				<verse number="4">On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I had a vision while I was standing on the bank of the great Tigris River.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I opened my eyes to look about me, and I saw a man approaching who was robed in white linen and wearing a belt of pure gold.</verse>
				<verse number="6">His body was like a glowing gemstone, his face shining as bright as lightning. His eyes were blazing like fiery torches; his arms and legs were gleaming like polished bronze; and the sound of his voice was thunderous, like the roar of a multitude.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Although others were present, I was the only one who experienced this open vision. Yet, it was so real that it terrified those who were with me, and they ran away to hide.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I found myself alone, gazing on this astounding vision; I was left stunned and powerless. My appearance was altered beyond recognition, and what little strength I had deserted me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">As soon as the angel began to speak to me, I fell unconscious with my face to the ground, as in a coma.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then I felt a powerful hand grip me and help me to my hands and knees. I was trembling with fear!</verse>
				<verse number="11">He said, “Daniel, you are greatly loved and a precious treasure to God. Now, stand up and understand the words that I am about to say, for God has sent me to you.” So, I rose to my feet, still shaking like a leaf.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He reassured me by saying, “Daniel, don’t be afraid, for I have come to bring to you the answer to your prayer. From the first day you sought to understand the revelation and humbled yourself before God, your words were heard in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="13">However, for the past twenty-one days, the principality over the kingdom of Persia stood to oppose and resist me. Then Michael, one of the chief princes of heaven, came to my assistance. I was left there, confronting the king of Persia.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now I have come to help you comprehend what will happen to your people in the final days, for the vision pertains to a time still to come.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Upon hearing these words, I bowed facedown and was left speechless.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then suddenly, one who looked like a man touched my lips, and I was finally able to speak. So, I said to the one standing in front of me, “My lord, this vision has left me overcome, undone, and overwhelmed. I feel totally weak and helpless.</verse>
				<verse number="17">My lord, how can I, your servant, even talk to you? I have no strength, and I can barely catch my breath!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Once again, the one who looked like a man gripped me and imparted strength to me.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He said to me, “Be strong! Be very, very strong! Do not be afraid, for you are greatly loved and a precious treasure to God. God’s peace is yours.” As he spoke those words, I felt strength pour into me, and I said, “Now, I’m ready to listen to you, my lord, for you have given me strength.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">He then said, “Don’t you know why I have come to you?</verse>
				<verse number="21">I will unveil to you what is written in the Book of Truth: but first, I want you to know that there is none who fights alongside me against these forces of darkness except Michael, your people’s prince. 11:1 In the first year that Darius the Mede was king, I stood up to support Michael and fought with him against the prince of Persia. 10:20b Now, I am about to go back and fight the principality with him. Once we have defeated him, the principality over Greece will come next.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="2">“I will now reveal the truth to you: Three more kings will rise to power in Persia; a fourth will come who will be much richer than all the others. His great wealth will cause his power to grow until his empire wages war against all the kingdoms of Greece.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then a warrior-king will arise who will govern a vast empire and do whatever he pleases.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But at the zenith of his power, his empire will be shattered and scattered to the four winds of heaven, though not to his descendants. It will not be as powerful as when he ruled it, for his dominion will be uprooted and will be passed on to others who are not his descendants.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">“The king of Egypt will grow powerful, but one of his commanders will rise to become even more powerful and rule a kingdom greater than his.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then, after some years have passed, an alliance will form. And in order to ensure the peace, the daughter of the king of Egypt will marry the king of Syria. However, her grip on power will not last for long, and the king, too, will lose his throne. In those days, she, her husband, her child, and those who escorted her to Syria will all be killed. Yet later,</verse>
				<verse number="7">one of her family members will rise to become the king of Egypt. He will come against the defenses of the walled city of the king of Syria and defeat the Syrian armies.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He will plunder their wealth and take it back to Egypt as spoils —all their precious gold, silver vessels, idols, and statues. For some time, he will leave the kingdom of Syria in peace.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Eventually, the king of Syria will invade the kingdom of Egypt, but he will have to retreat to his own country.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The king’s sons will prepare for war, assembling a powerful group of warriors. One of his sons will swiftly advance, sweeping over the land like a powerful flood. Their armies will press forward and fight all the way to the strong, walled fortress of the king of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Then the king of Egypt will fly into a rage and set out to launch an offensive against the king of Syria, who will have an immense army on his side. However, the king of Egypt will conquer the Syrian forces.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The king of Egypt will be filled with pride over his victory and of the many tens of thousands of soldiers he slaughtered, but he will not continue to be victorious.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Then the king of Syria will recruit an even larger army than before, and after some years, he will advance a second time with a massive army, fully equipped with weapons and supplies.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“At that time, many will take up arms against the king of Egypt. Renegades from among your own people will rebel in the hope of realizing the vision; but they will fail.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the king of Syria will advance and build up siege-ramps to capture a strongly fortified city. The Egyptian forces will not stand their ground; even their elite troops will not be strong enough to resist.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The invading king of Syria will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to resist him. He will occupy the land of splendor, and all of it will be under his control.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Then, with the might of his entire kingdom, he will resolve to conquer Egypt by cunningly making a peace treaty with the king of Egypt. The king of Syria will offer one of his daughters in marriage to the king of Egypt in order to defeat his kingdom, but his plan will fall apart and will not work to his advantage.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The king of Syria will next turn to the coastlands and capture many cities, but a foreign commander will put a stop to his arrogance and make him suffer the consequences of his defiant insolence.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“He will then retreat to the well protected fortresses of his own country. In time, he will be defeated, lose his grip on power, and disappear.</verse>
				<verse number="20">His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the wealth of his kingdom. In a short time, however, the king will die, though not in the heat of battle.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">The man in white linen continued: “In his place will rise a despised usurper of the throne, who had no claim to royal status. He will attack the kingdom when the people least suspect it, and he will seize the kingdom through deceit.</verse>
				<verse number="22">He will totally sweep away every opposing army that stands before him and crush them. He will even kill the high priest of the covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And after he forms an alliance with him, he will act deceitfully and, despite his initial small following, he will grow ever stronger.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then unexpectedly, he will, by stealth, invade rich, fertile provinces and achieve what none of his ancestors did. And he will distribute the spoils and lavish them upon his followers. He will plot to defeat opposing forces protected in fortified positions and will succeed, but only for a short time.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“He will stir up his might and courage, muster a large army, and wage war against the king of Egypt. However, the king of Egypt will fight back with an even greater army—a massive and powerful army—but he will be defeated because of secret plans devised against him.</verse>
				<verse number="26">His closest advisers, who eat at the king’s table, will attempt to kill him. His army will be swept away, and many will fall in the slaughter.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“These two kings will sit at the same table and exchange lies with their hearts filled with evil motives. But their plans will come to nothing, for the time set by God has still not yet come.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then the treacherous king of Syria will start back home with his great spoils. He will set his heart against the holy covenant, take action against it, and then return to his own land.</verse>
				<verse number="29">In the time God has appointed, he will go back to attack Egypt again, but this time the outcome will not be as before.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Roman ships will oppose him, and he will lose heart. He will retreat and take out his indignation against the holy covenant and show favor to those who forsake that holy covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="31">“He will then dispatch his armed forces to enter and profane the sacred temple-stronghold. They will abolish the daily sacrifice and, in its place, set the blasphemous abomination that brings desolation.</verse>
				<verse number="32">The Syrian king will entice with flattery those who betray the holy covenant, but those who know their God will stand firm and valiantly resist.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“These who are filled with wisdom will help many understand what is happening. However, for a season, they will face severe testing. Some will go into captivity, some will be robbed, and some will be killed by the sword and by the flames.</verse>
				<verse number="34">During this persecution, God’s people will receive little help, though many will join with them insincerely.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Even some of the wise leaders will stumble, yet this will lead to them being purged, purified, and made clean—until the time of the end, for the appointed time is still to come.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">“The king will grow more and more arrogant and do whatever he pleases. He will exalt himself above every other god, and utter horrendous blasphemies against the God of all gods. He will be successful until God’s wrath reaches the boiling point, for what God has decreed will certainly be fulfilled.</verse>
				<verse number="37">The king will not respect the gods of his ancestors, the god worshiped by women, nor any other god because he will consider himself the greatest god of all.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Instead, he will glorify the god of strongholds. He will honor this god, unknown to his ancestors, with gold and silver, precious stones and costly gifts.</verse>
				<verse number="39">That king, with the help of his foreign god, will defend his own fortresses. He will give great honor to those who accept him as ruler, and elevate them as high officials and parcel out the land to them as their reward for their loyalty.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">“At the time of the end, the king of Egypt will lock horns with the king of Syria, but the king of Syria will come storming out against him like a whirlwind—with chariots, cavalry, and a great fleet of ships. He will pass through countries, overrun them, and sweep through them like a flood.</verse>
				<verse number="41">He will even invade the glorious land, and many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab, and what remains of the Ammonites will escape.</verse>
				<verse number="42">“He will use his power to attack many countries, and Egypt will not escape his onslaught.</verse>
				<verse number="43">He will confiscate all the Egyptian treasures, including its silver and gold. Libyans and Ethiopians will be in submission to him.</verse>
				<verse number="44">“Then reports will come from the east and the north that will trouble him, and he will set out with furious rage to bring death and complete destruction to many.</verse>
				<verse number="45">He will pitch his lavish royal tents between the sea and the beautiful mountain of the holy temple. Yet he will come to his end all alone, with no one to stand with him.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">“At that time, the great angel-prince, Michael, protector of your people, will take his stand. It will be a time of great distress, the worst trouble your nation has ever known. When that time comes, your own people will be spared—all those whose names are found written in the Book of Life.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Multitudes of those who are sleeping in the Land of Dust will awaken, some to everlasting life, some to shame and everlasting disgrace.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Those who are wise will shine radiantly as the sky at midday. And those who turn many to the way of righteousness will shine brightly as stars for all eternity.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“And you, Daniel, must guard these words and keep the scroll sealed until the time of the end. Many will go here and there, and knowledge will continue to increase.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">I, Daniel, then looked and saw two others standing, one on each bank of the river.</verse>
				<verse number="6">One of them said to the man dressed in linen who was hovering above the river, “How long until these wonders take place?”</verse>
				<verse number="7">I heard the man answer who was dressed in linen, hovering above the river. He raised his hands to heaven and swore by him who lives forever, “A time, and two times, and half a time. All this persecution will not end until the opposition of God’s holy people is completely crushed.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">I heard his answer, but it was like a riddle to me. So, I asked him, “Sir, how will all of this transpire?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“You may go in peace, Daniel,” he replied. “The understanding of this message is to remain secret and sealed until the time of the end.</verse>
				<verse number="10">God will purify many people and make them clean and spotless, while the wicked will continue doing what is wicked. This revelation will remain a riddle to the wicked, but those who are wise will have profound understanding.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Between the end of the continual burnt offering and the abomination that brings destruction will be 1,290 days.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Blessed are those who wait and faithfully endure to the end of the 1,335 days.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">Here is Yahweh ’s message that came through the prophet Hosea son of Beeri. At that time, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah ruled as kings of Judah, and Jeroboam the son of Joash was king in Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="2">This is the beginning of what Yahweh spoke through Hosea. Yahweh said to me, “Go and marry an adulterous woman and have children of adultery because the people of the land are adulterers. They have forsaken me.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So I married a woman named Gomer, Diblaim’s daughter. She became pregnant and bore a son.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yahweh said to me, “Name him Jezreel because it will not be long before I punish the dynasty of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel and then destroy the kingdom of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="5">At that time, I will smash Israel’s military power in the Valley of Jezreel.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Later, Gomer became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter. Yahweh said to me: “Name her No-Tender-Mercy because I will no longer have tender mercy on the nation of Israel. I will certainly not forgive them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will, however, have compassion on the nation of Judah. “I will rescue them! I will not give them victory through their weapons and military might. It will not be their horsemen and chariots that deliver them. I, Yahweh their God, will save them!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">After Gomer weaned her daughter, No-Tender-Mercy, she became pregnant again and gave birth to a son.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Yahweh said to me, “Name him Not-My-People because you, Israel, are not mine anymore, and I am not yours.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yet someday, the number of the people of Israel will become as innumerable as the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted. Although God named them Not-My-People, he will restore them and call them Children of the Living God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The divided people of Judah and Israel will reunite. They will appoint themselves one head and will once again cover the land like grass that sprouts from the ground. How great will be the day when the meaning of Jezreel’s name is fulfilled: God sows!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">“Call your brothers My-People and your sisters Shown-Tender-Mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Go to court. Take legal action against your mother and put her on trial. For she is no longer my wife, and I am no longer her husband. She must remove the symbols of prostitution from her face and the seductive charms of her adulteries from between her breasts.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If not, I will strip her naked and humiliate her and expose her nakedness as on the day she was born. I will make her as bare as the desert, turn her into a barren land, and let her die of thirst.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I will feel no pity for her children, since they are the children of her shameless prostitution.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yes, their mother has prostituted herself, the one who conceived them has disgraced herself. For she said, ‘I will chase after my lovers; they will provide all I need: my robe, my clothing, my oil, and my wine.’</verse>
				<verse number="6">Behold! I will block her way with thorns and build up a wall against her to stop her in her tracks.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then when she tries to chase her lovers, she will not be able to catch them. When she looks for them, she will not find them. Eventually, she’ll say, ‘I must go back to my own husband. I was much better off then than I am now!’</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yet, she never understood that I was the one who was giving her the grain, sweet wine, and olive oil. I lavished upon her an abundance of silver and gold, which she took and made into idols of Baal.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So I will take back my grain at harvest time and my new wine when the grapes are ripe. I will snatch away my wool and my flax used for clothing to cover her naked body.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then very soon I will publicly expose her disgrace before her lovers’ gawking eyes — so that no man will steal her from me.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I will put an end to all her joyful festivities, her feasts, her new moons and her Sabbaths, and her celebrations will all cease.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will ruin her vines and fig trees of which she used to say, ‘These are the fees that my lovers pay to me.’ I will turn vines and fig trees into a jungle and make their fruit nothing but food for wild beasts.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I will make her pay for the feast days, feasts for her to burn incense to the Baals. She got all dressed up and chased after her lovers, adorned with earrings and necklaces for them. And me? She has forgotten about me. This is Yahweh speaking to you!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Behold, I am going to romance her and draw her into the wilderness; I will speak tenderly to her there with words of love and win her heart back to me.</verse>
				<verse number="15">There I will give her back her vineyards, and make the Valley of Trouble an open door to hope. There she will respond to me and sing as when she was young, as on the day when she came up from Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“And I, Yahweh, declare that when that day comes, you will call me ‘My Husband’ and no longer call me ‘My Master.’</verse>
				<verse number="17">I will banish the names of the Baals from her lips, and she will never mention their names again.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When that day comes, I will make a covenant for you, my people, with all the birds and wild animals and creatures that creep upon the ground. I will break the bow and the sword and remove the weapons of war from the land, and I will let you live in peace and safety.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I will take you to myself as my wife forever. I will make you mine in righteousness and justice, with unfailing love and tender affection.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yes, I will commit myself to you in faithfulness. Then you will know me intimately as Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When that day comes, I will be the God who responds,” declares Yahweh. “I will respond to the heavens, and the heavens will respond to the earth,</verse>
				<verse number="22">and the earth will respond to the grain, the wine, and the olive oil, and they will respond to Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I will sow her in the land as my very own. I will show my tender mercy to No-Tender-Mercy. I will declare to Not-My-People my words of endearment: ‘You are my people,’ and they will say to me, ‘You are my One-and-Only God.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh said to me, “Go again to her. Love her and demonstrate love to your wife again even though she has another lover. Love the adulteress with the same love that I, Yahweh, have for the adulterous Israelites who turn to other gods and love to give offerings to their idols.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">So I negotiated to buy her for the bride-price of fifteen shekels of silver and nine bushels of barley.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And I said to her, “ Your sinful life is now over, and you must stay with me in my home for many days. You will no longer commit adultery by giving yourself to another man, and I will remain faithful to you in the same way.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">For the Israelites will have to spend many days deprived of political leaders, outward forms of religion, and the means of foretelling the future.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But afterward, the Israelites will return and again long for Yahweh their covenant God and for a David-like king. They will turn trembling in awe to Yahweh and rediscover his goodness and gifts in the future.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Israelites, hear the words of Yahweh, for he has charges to bring against the citizens of the country! “There is no faithfulness in the land, no tenderness and love— no knowledge and understanding of God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Your crimes are these: cursing others, lying, breaking your promises, murdering, stealing, and committing adultery. You have no moral decency, and bloodshed is the order of the day.</verse>
				<verse number="3">This is why the land withers away, and all who live in it waste away— the wild animals, the birds, even the fish disappear.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">“But let no one accuse or blame others, for my contention is with you, the priests.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So, you priests will stumble on the road to ruin in broad daylight, and the prophet will stumble with you in the dark. I will destroy Israel, who gave you birth.</verse>
				<verse number="6">My people are destroyed because they do not know who I am. Since you have refused to let them know who I am, I will refuse you as my priests. Since you have ignored the teaching of your God, I will ignore your children.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">“The more you priests increase in number, the more of your sins against me I have counted. You have exchanged me, your glorious God, for something shameful.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The priests lead my people into sin so they can eat more of their sin offerings. They want the people to sin more and more.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The people get the priests they deserve! I will punish them both for their conduct; their evil deeds will cling to them.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They will eat but never be satisfied; they will have sex but will remain infertile since they are unfaithful to me, Yahweh, and are devoted to other gods instead.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Here is what robs their ability to understand: giving themselves to prostitution and to old and new wine.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">“My people seek revelation from a block of wood and ask a stick what they should do. They have left me and are led astray by their spiritual adultery. They have deserted their God</verse>
				<verse number="13">to offer sacrifice on the mountains. They burn incense on the hills, under oaks, and every tall sacred tree, worshiping false gods in their pleasant shade. This is why your daughters became cultic prostitutes and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will not punish your daughters for their prostitution nor your daughters-in-law for their adultery because it is you men who are wandering off with whores and offering sacrifice with cultic prostitutes. So the saying is true: ‘A people without understanding will come to ruin.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Although you, Israel, are unfaithful to me, there is no need for Judah to sin by following your example. Do not go for worship at Gilgal or go up to the wicked Bethel. Do not swear oaths any longer, saying, ‘As surely as Yahweh lives,’</verse>
				<verse number="16">for Israel is as stubborn as a mule. So do they really think that I, Yahweh, am going to pasture them like an obedient lamb in a broad meadow?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Ephraim is under the spell of idols—leave him alone!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Their drunken orgy over, the people delight in their prostitution, preferring shame to honor.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They will be swept away on the wings of the wind, and their pagan sacrifices will bring them nothing but disgrace.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">“Hear this, you priests! Pay attention, you leaders of Israel! Listen, all of you among the royal household! You are responsible for administering justice, but you have led the people into idolatry by setting a trap at Mizpah and spreading a net over Mount Tabor.</verse>
				<verse number="2">You have dug a deep ditch of sexual immorality, and so, I will punish you all.</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Israel, you cannot hide from me; for I know Ephraim through and through. Yet you have been unfaithful to me. Israel’s worship of me is grossly defiled.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They no longer even know me, Yahweh. Their evil deeds block the way for them to return to me, their God, because they are possessed by a spirit of prostitution.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Israel’s own arrogance speaks for itself. Israel and Ephraim have no one else to blame, for their own guilt makes them stumble. Judah will be dragged down with them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">No matter how many animals they bring to offer as sacrifices to Yahweh, they will not find him, for he has withdrawn himself from them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They have been proven unfaithful to Yahweh, having fathered illegitimate children. Now, before the new moon festival, they and their fields will be devoured.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Sound the shofar in Gibeah, blow the trumpet in Ramah, and raise the war cry at Bethel: ‘On your guard, men of Benjamin!’</verse>
				<verse number="9">When the day of reckoning comes, Ephraim will be overthrown. For I have pronounced certain doom on the tribes of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“I am angry with the leaders of Judah, for they came into the Northern Kingdom and stole their land. I will pour my wrath out on them like a flood.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Ephraim is oppressed, crushed by the verdict, for having deliberately chased a lie.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Because of this, I will be like a maggot in the wound of Ephraim and like gangrene for the people of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Once Ephraim realized that he was sick and that Judah had an ulcer, Ephraim then turned to Assyria for help and sent messengers to the great king, but he has no power to cure you or to heal your wound.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For I will attack Ephraim like a lion and the land of Judah like a young lion. I will maul my prey and drag them away, and no one will be able to snatch them from my hands.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I will return to my place until they confess their guilt and seek my face. Then, in their distress, they will eagerly seek me and my grace.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">And they will say to one another: “Come, everyone! Come back to Yahweh. Although he hit us hard, now he will heal us. Although he wounded us, now he will bandage our wounds.</verse>
				<verse number="2">After two days, he will revive us, and on the third day he will raise us up. Then we will live in his presence</verse>
				<verse number="3">and truly know him. Let us come to know Yahweh intimately and eagerly press in to know him fully. He will come to us as surely as the sun rises to greet us each day. He will come to us like refreshing rain, like a spring rain that showers the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Ephraim, what am I going to do with you? How should I deal with you, Judah? For your faithfulness is as fleeting as the morning mist, like the dew that quickly disappears.</verse>
				<verse number="5">This is why I have used my prophets to slice you open and the words of my mouth to slay you. For my judgments wake you up like the blazing light of dawn.</verse>
				<verse number="6">What I want from you is steadfast love not simply dead sacrifices; I want you to know me intimately not simply give burnt offerings.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But, like Adam, you have broken my covenant. How unfaithful you are to me!</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Gilead is a city with streets stained with bloody footprints, a city known for its evildoers.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“The priests are like a gang of robbers waiting in ambush, a gang of priests who commit murder on the road to Shechem. What heinous crimes they have committed!</verse>
				<verse number="10">“I have witnessed a horrible thing in Israel’s temple; there Ephraim practices temple prostitution, grossly defiling Israel.</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">whenever I desire to heal Israel, I am confronted by Ephraim’s guilt, and all I can see is Samaria’s sin. For they all practice deceit. No place is secure. They break into homes and steal. Gangs raid in the open.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But it never occurs to them that I, Yahweh, remember all their evil deeds. They are all prisoners of their own wickedness, and their sin stares me in the face.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh says, “They deceive the king with their wickedness and the rulers with their lies.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They are all unfaithful to the king. Their anger is like an overheated oven. Their oven burns so hot that the baker could knead his bread at night until it rises in the morning and he still wouldn’t need to stoke the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="5">On the king’s day of celebration, his officials are drunk with wine, and the king trusted the traitors.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Their hearts are like an oven that burns with treachery. All night long, their anger smolders; then in the morning, it bursts into flame.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yes, they are all as hot as an oven, ready to consume their rulers. All their kings have fallen in this way, yet not one of them has ever called on me.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh says, “Ephraim mixes with the nations. My people are like half-done flatbread, burnt on one side and raw dough on the other.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Ephraim does not realize alliances with foreigners devoured his strength; even his hair has turned gray, but he has no clue.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Israel’s arrogance has become his own accuser. Yet in spite of all these troubles, they do not seek me, Yahweh their God, nor come back to me.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Ephraim is like a dove, silly and senseless, first calling on Egypt for help then turning to Assyria.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Wherever they turn, I will spread out my net and catch them. I will bring them down like the birds from the air. I will punish them for the evil they have done.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“They are doomed for having fled from me. Destruction will seize them for having rebelled against me. I longed to pay their ransom time and time again, but they have believed and spoken lies about me.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Their cries to me are not with a sincere heart, and they wail like heathens on their beds. When they ritually mutilate themselves to cause their grain and grapes to grow, they know they are rebelling against me.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Though I held them up, giving strength to their arms, they plotted evil against me.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They turned in the wrong direction to a god who is no god at all. They are like a warped bow that can’t shoot straight. Their leaders will be killed in war because of all their arrogant, defiant words. Oh, how the Egyptians will mock them!”</verse>

			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">“Blow the shofar! Sound the alarm! Like a scavenging vulture, disaster is swooping down on Yahweh ’s land because they have violated my covenant and rebelled against my instruction.</verse>

				<verse number="4">“They have selected kings but without my consent, and appointed leaders but without seeking my advice. They have made idols out of their silver and gold— what an excellent way to lose their money!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Samaria, I reject your calf-idol! My anger blazes against your people. How long before they reclaim their purity?</verse>
				<verse number="6">Surely, this calf-idol originated with Israel. A craftsman made it; it’s not even a god at all. Yes, this calf of Samaria will be shattered to pieces.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Since they sow the wind, they will reap the whirlwind. They will reap headless stalks of grain that produce no flour, and even if they did produce grain, foreigners would swallow it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Israel has already been swallowed up and is now powerless among the nations. Israel, you are like a useless piece of broken pottery.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For indeed, you have sought assistance from Assyria, like a wild donkey wandering alone. Ephraim has sold herself to other lovers.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Although they have hired allies from among the nations, I will round them up for judgment. They are already wasting away under the oppression of the king of princes.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">“The more altars Ephraim builds, the more places the people have to sin— altars for sinning and not for sin offerings.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Although many times I have written many rules for my people, Ephraim regards them as something strange and foreign.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They love to offer sacrifices to me so that they can eat the meat. But I, Yahweh, take no pleasure in them. I will not forget their guilt, and I will punish them for their sins. They will have to go back to Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Israel has built palaces but has forgotten his Maker. Judah keeps on building fortified towns, but I will rain fire down on his cities to devour the strongholds with flames.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Stop rejoicing, people of Israel! Stop rejoicing as you celebrate your festivals like pagans, for you have deserted your God and committed fornication with other gods. You have loved the prostitute’s pay on every threshing floor as if Baal were the one who could give you good harvests.</verse>
				<verse number="2">You will not be able to enjoy the bounty of your harvest— for others will consume your wheat, oil, and wine.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Ephraim will not remain in Yahweh ’s land; they will have to go back to Egypt or eat Assyria’s polluted food.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Their sacrifices will not be pleasing to Yahweh. They will not be able to offer their firstfruits nor pour out drink offerings of wine to him, for their food will be like funeral fare— food given to those in mourning. Whoever eats it will become unclean. They will only have sufficient food to satisfy their hunger and not enough to offer to Yahweh in his house.</verse>
				<verse number="5">What will you do on the appointed feast days, on the day you gather for Yahweh ’s festivals?</verse>
				<verse number="6">Look! Even if you flee from destruction, Egypt will round you up. Your gathering together will be for your burial in Memphis. Your silver treasures will be lost among the weeds, and thornbushes will overgrow your homes.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Your day of punishment has come, and the time for recompense has arrived, and Israel will know it. You say, “The prophet is a fool. This man of the Spirit is crazy!” But your guilt is great, even greater than all your deep-seated hatred.</verse>
				<verse number="8">This prophet of my God is a watchman for Israel. Yet, everywhere he goes, the people set traps for him. He is considered an enemy in the house of his God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Israel has sunk so deeply into depravity— just as you did at Gibeah. God will not overlook the guilt of your actions; he will punish you for your sins.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yahweh says, “When I found you, Israel, it was as pleasing as finding ripe grapes in the desert. When I saw your ancestors, it was as delightful as seeing the early ripe figs on a new fig tree in its first productive season. But when they reached Baal Peor they devoted themselves to the shameful god, Baal, and became as shameful as the things they loved.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The glory of Israel will fly away from you like a bird, leaving you infertile—no pregnancy, no conception.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Even if they raise their children, I will remove them, and not one will be left alive. Even worse than that will be when I desert you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Ephraim, I once saw you like the city of Tyre planted in a pleasant setting, but now you must send out your sons to be slaughtered in battle.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yahweh, give them . . . Yes, what punishment should I ask you to give? Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts with no milk.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh says, “All of Ephraim’s evil began at Gilgal. It was there that I started to become their enemy. I will drive them out of my house because of the evil they have done. I will no longer love them because all their leaders are rebels.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Ephraim, you’re finished! Your root has dried up, and you will bear no more fruit. Even if the women do give birth, I will put their beloved children to death.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">My God will disown you because you have not listened to him. You will become wanderers among the nations.</verse>

			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Israel was once like a lush vine that produced plenty of grapes. Yet the more his fruit increased, the more pagan altars he built. The more abundantly his land increased, the more abundant were his sacred fertility pillars.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Israel’s devotion is false and divided; soon the people must pay the penalty for their guilt. Yahweh will demolish their altars and shatter their sacred pillars.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then they will say, “We have lost our king because we have not feared Yahweh, but what could a human king do for us anyway?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">All they do is make empty speeches, phony promises, and useless treaties. Their so-called justice spreads like poisonous weeds among the furrows of the fields.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Samaria’s citizens will tremble and mourn over the loss of their sacred calves of Bethel. Everyone will wail over its loss along with their idolatrous priests because their “glory” has gone into exile.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They will carry the calf-idol to Assyria as tribute to the great king. Ephraim will reap the shame. What a disgrace for Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Samaria—your king has had his day. Your king will disappear like a twig on the surface of the waters.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The hilltop shrines, the vanity and sin of Israel, will be demolished. Thorns and thistles will overgrow and cover their altars. Then they will say to the mountains, “Bury us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Israel, since the days of Gibeah, you have not stopped sinning. From then until now, you have persisted in your ways. Were not the evildoers overtaken by war in Gibeah?</verse>
				<verse number="10">When I am ready, I will discipline these wayward people, and armies will be gathered against them to put them in bonds for their double sins.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh says, “Ephraim was once obedient like a well-trained cow that loved to thresh the grain. Seeing her fair neck, I thought I would put Ephraim in the yoke. Judah will have to plow; Jacob must level the soil.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Sow seeds of righteousness for yourselves, and you will reap a harvest of God’s unending love. Break up the hard, fallow ground of your heart. For it is time to seek Yahweh ’s favor until he comes to pour out righteousness on you like falling rain.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But instead, you have cultivated lawlessness and reaped a harvest of injustice. You have eaten the fruit of your lies. Because you have trusted in your own strength and in your vast, mighty army,</verse>
				<verse number="14">war cries will break out against your people, and all your fortified cities will be destroyed. Just as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel on the day of battle, when children and their mothers were dashed to death on the ground,</verse>
				<verse number="15">so it will be done to you, Bethel, because of your evil stacked upon evil. At dawn, as the battle begins, your kingship will be no more.”</verse>

				<verse number="1">“I have deeply loved Israel from his very beginning. From Egypt, I called my son.</verse>

				<verse number="3">even though I was the one who taught Israel to walk. I took them up in my arms and carried them, yet they did not acknowledge that I was their healer.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I gently pulled them to my heart with the cords of affectionate love. I stooped down to care for them and gently fed them. I showed them the same kind of tender love as one who picks up an infant and holds it to his cheek.”</verse>

				<verse number="9">I will certainly not punish you in my burning anger, nor will I turn around and destroy Israel again, for I am God and not a mere human being. I am the Holy One in the midst of you; I will not come to you in my wrath.”</verse>

				<verse number="2">Yahweh is bringing charges against Judah. He will punish Jacob as his conduct deserves; he will repay the people for what they have done.</verse>
				<verse number="3">In his mother’s womb, Jacob grabbed his twin brother’s heel; when he grew to be a man, he struggled with God.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He wrestled with the angel and won; he wept and sought his blessing. God met him at Bethel, and there he spoke to us.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yes, Yahweh is the God of Angel Armies. Yahweh —remember his name!</verse>
				<verse number="6">And you, to your God you must return. Stand guard over divine love and justice and always put your trust in him as you wait patiently for your God.</verse>

				<verse number="3">Therefore, the entire tribe of Ephraim will vanish like the morning mist, like the dew that quickly disappears, like the chaff blown by the wind from the threshing floor, like smoke rising from a chimney.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“I, Yahweh, have been your true God ever since your days in Egypt. You must know no other god but me. There is no other god who can save you.</verse>

				<verse number="14">Shall I save my people from the clutches of Sheol? Shall I ransom them from Death’s firm grip? Hey, Death! Tell me, where is your punishment? Hey, Grave! Tell me, where is your sting? Revenge will be hidden from my eyes.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Though Ephraim bears more fruit than his brothers, Yahweh ’s breath will blow from the desert. The scorching wind will come from the east; it will dry up his springs, and his wells will run dry. The wind will come to plunder his treasury, robbing it of every precious thing.</verse>

				<verse number="7">They will come back to live beneath the shadow of my blessing. They will flourish like a sunlit field of wheat and thrive as a blossoming vine. Their wine will be as famous as the wine of Lebanon.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Ephraim will say, ‘Why would I ever want to worship idols anymore?’ I, Yahweh, am the one who hears, responds, and watches over him. For I will shelter him under my branches like an evergreen cypress. Ephraim, you owe your fruitfulness to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Do you consider yourself wise? Then you will understand these words. Are you discerning? Then you will discover their meaning. For Yahweh ’s paths are smooth for walking, and the righteous will walk in them, but the rebellious sinners will stumble in them.</verse>

				<verse number="12">The vine has withered, and the fig tree wilts away. In fact, every tree of the field has withered— pomegranate, date palm, and apple tree. And in the same way, the people’s joy and gladness has withered too.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You priests, put on sackcloth and weep. You ministers who serve at the altar, mourn and wail! Go, spend the night in the temple, you servants of my God, because there is no more grain or wine offerings to bring to the house of your God.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Declare a holy fast. Call a solemn assembly. Gather the leaders and all the people of the land to the house of Yahweh your God. Cry out with all your hearts to Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="15">How awful that time will be! Look! The day of Yahweh is certainly coming— the day when the Divine Destroyer brings destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Has not the food supply been cut off before our very eyes? Have not the joyful celebrations been silenced in the temple of our God?</verse>
				<verse number="17">The seeds shrivel under the dry clods. The storehouses are empty; the barns are bare and broken down because the harvest has disappeared.</verse>
				<verse number="18">How loudly the cattle groan because they have no pasture! The herds wander bewildered. Not even the flocks of sheep are able to graze.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yahweh, I cry out to you with all my heart, for fire has devoured the open pastures, and flame has scorched all the trees of the field.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The sources of water have run dry and fire has devoured the pasturelands, leaving the wild animals panting loudly for you.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Blow the shofar in Zion, sound the alarm on my mountain of holiness! Shake the people awake, for the day of Yahweh is coming. Yes, it is almost here.</verse>
				<verse number="2">It will be a day of darkness and gloom, a black and cloudy day. As the dawning light spreads across the mountains, so will a great and powerful people advance, an army such as has never been seen before and such as will never be seen again, not even in all the ages to come.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Fire blazes before them, and behind them the flame consumes. Before their eyes, the earth is like the garden of Eden, and behind them they leave a devastated wilderness. Nothing escapes them unscathed.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Their appearance is like horses prepared for battle; like war horses, they charge ahead.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They rumble like war chariots; they leap over the mountaintops. They devour the land, with the sound of a wildfire devouring stubble. They are a mighty people who are prepared for the battle.</verse>
				<verse number="6">At the sight of this army, nations panic, all their faces grow pale.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They press forward like mighty warriors, and scale walls like elite soldiers, each marching straight ahead, not swerving from his path.</verse>
				<verse number="8">They never jostle each other, for each one stays on his own path. They storm the city and burst through its defenses. Together they are unstoppable.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They rush against the city and scale its walls. They climb up into the houses and enter through the windows like thieves.</verse>
				<verse number="10">As that army advances, the earth shakes, and the heavens tremble. The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars no longer shine.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh ’s voice thunders as he leads his valiant troops. Numberless are the mighty ones who obey his commands. Yes, the day of Yahweh is great and astonishing! Who can withstand it?</verse>
				<verse number="12">“But it’s not too late,” declares Yahweh. “Come back to me now with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Tearing your clothes in sorrow is not enough— tear open your hearts!” Come back to Yahweh your God, for he is gracious to welcome you home and compassionate to embrace you. Yahweh is slow to anger and so rich in extravagant love for you. He is always ready to forgive and cancel judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Who knows if he will not turn around and show pity, leaving behind a blessing. Then you can bring offerings of grain and wine to be presented to Yahweh your God.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Blow the shofar in Zion! Call for a fast and proclaim a solemn assembly.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Gather the people together, and prepare them for a sacred meeting. From the oldest to the youngest, assemble the community, even the nursing infants. Let the newly wedded bride and bridegroom come from their chamber.</verse>
				<verse number="17">With everyone gathered in the courtyard, the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, must stand weeping between the portico and the altar of burnt offering. Let them face the sanctuary and intercede, saying, “Spare your people! Have pity, Yahweh! Do not expose your very own people to the contempt and sarcasm of the nations. Why give the nations cause to say, ‘Where is their God now?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Yahweh showed his great love for the land and showered compassion upon his people.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yahweh answered their cry and said, “Behold, now your fast is over. I am providing you with plenty of wheat, wine, and olive oil until you are satisfied. Never again will I make you an object of scorn among the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="20">I will remove your northern enemy far from you and drive him into a dry, desolate land, with his front ranks to the Dead Sea and his rear guard to the Mediterranean Sea. I will destroy them for their boastful deeds, and people will smell the stench of their dead bodies.” Truly, he has done great things!</verse>
				<verse number="21">My land, do not fear, for your restoration has come! Be glad and rejoice, you people, for Yahweh has done marvelous things for you.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Animals of the field, do not be afraid, for the pastures of the wilderness are green again, the trees bear their fruit, and the vine and fig tree yield their richness.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Children of Zion, be glad! Celebrate the mighty acts of Yahweh your God, for he has given you a teacher of righteousness whose teaching is like the refreshing spring rains. And he will pour down the rains for you, the spring and autumn rains as before.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“The threshing floors will be full of grain, the pits beside the presses will overflow with new wine and fresh oil.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I will make up for the years the swarms of locusts ruined your harvest— the hopping-locusts, the destroying-locusts, and the cutting-locusts— my great army that I sent against you.</verse>
				<verse number="26">You will eat to your heart’s content and be satisfied. You will gloriously praise the name of Yahweh your God, who has treated you so wonderfully. And never will my people be despised again.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then, Israel, you will know without question that I am dwelling among you. I am Yahweh your God, and no one else. I say again: no more will I surrender my people to shame.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Then afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on everyone. Your sons and your daughters will boldly prophesy, your elderly will have supernatural dreams, and your youth will experience ecstatic visions.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And I will even pour out my Spirit in those days upon every servant, both male and female.</verse>
				<verse number="30">“And I will display amazing wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The sun will be darkened, and the moon will appear as red as blood. These events will occur before the great and awesome day of Yahweh comes.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And everyone who sincerely worships Yahweh will be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be a remnant who are spared, as I, Yahweh, have promised. They will be the chosen survivors whom I, Yahweh, will call.”</verse>

				<verse number="1">“Behold! In those days, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,</verse>
				<verse number="2">I will gather all the nations together. I will bring them to the Valley of Yahweh ’s Judgment. I will take them to court there for all they have done against Israel— my people and my inheritance. I will execute judgment upon them because they have scattered my people among the nations and divided my land among themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They cast lots for my people and sold them into slavery. They traded a boy to pay for a prostitute and trafficked a girl for a drink of wine.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And what have you done to me, Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of Philistia? Are you trying to take revenge on me? If you are, I will swiftly and speedily pay you back and return your revenge so that it lands squarely on your own heads.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For you have stolen my silver and gold and carried off my valuable treasures into your temples.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks to be taken as slaves far from their homeland.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Behold! I will rouse them to return and come back from the places to which you have sold them. I will do to you the very thing that you have done to them.</verse>

				<verse number="13">“Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe for judgment. Come and tread the grapes of wrath. The winepress is full and the vats are overflowing for their wickedness is so great!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Multitudes! So many multitudes in the Valley of Decision! For the day of Yahweh is near in the Valley of the Verdict.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars no longer shine.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yahweh roars from Zion, and his voice thunders from Jerusalem; heaven and earth tremble. But Yahweh will be a shelter for his people, a faithful fortress for Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God, who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain. Jerusalem will be a sanctuary, and foreigners will never conquer it again.</verse>
				<verse number="18">A time is coming when the mountains will drip with new wine and the hills will flow with milk, and all the arid streambeds of Judah will run with water year-round. A fountain will spring from Yahweh ’s temple and descend to the valley of acacia trees.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Egypt will become a desert and Edom a desolate wilderness because of the atrocious acts of violence they committed against the people of Judah, whose innocent blood they shed in their land.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">There was a prophet named Amos, a herdsman from the town of Tekoa. Two years before the great earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah, and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel, God revealed these prophetic visions to Amos about Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Amos said: “ Yahweh comes roaring out of Zion; from Jerusalem he comes with his thunderous voice. The shepherds’ lush pastures are dried up, and the trees on top of Mount Carmel wither.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Here is the message of Yahweh: “For the three terrible crimes of the people of Damascus— no, make that four — I will not turn back my wrath. For they have treated the people of Gilead with savage cruelty, running over them with a threshing sledge equipped with iron teeth.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So I will send fire down on the dynasty of Hazael to devour the royal palaces defended by Ben-Hadad.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I will smash the city gates of Damascus, I will cut down the ruler who sits in the Valley of Wickedness, the one who holds the royal scepter in the Paradise of Pleasure. And the people of Syria will go back to where they came from—to Kir,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Here is the message of Yahweh: “For the three terrible crimes of the people of Gaza— no, make that four— I will not turn back my wrath. They have deported an entire community of exiles as slaves to Edom.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will send fire down on the walls of Gaza to consume its fortresses.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I will cut off the ruler of Ashdod and the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon. I will strike my blows against the city of Ekron, and what’s left of the Philistines will perish,” says the Lord Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh says this: “For the three terrible crimes of the people of Tyre— no, make that four— I will not turn back my wrath. For they deported entire people groups into exile in the land of Edom. In so doing, they broke the covenant of brotherhood.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So I will send fire down on the city walls of Tyre to devour her fortresses.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yahweh says this: “For the three terrible crimes of the Edomites— no, make that four— I will not turn back my wrath. For Edom hunted down his relatives, the Israelites, with the sword, and he refused to show mercy. His anger never died down, and his rage continued to the end.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will set the city of Teman on fire to burn up the fortresses of Bozrah.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh says this: “For the three terrible crimes of the Ammonites— no, make that four— I will not turn back my wrath. In order to seize more land for themselves, they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Therefore I will burn down the city walls of Rabbah to consume its fortresses. War cries will be heard on the day of battle; like a whirlwind, war will ravage the land.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Ammon’s king will be taken into captivity, he and his officials with him,” says Yahweh.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh says this: “For the three terrible crimes of the Moabites— no, make that four— I will not turn back my wrath. They burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So I will send fire down into Moab to devour the fortresses of Kerioth. Moab will perish in the heat of battle amid war cries and the blaring of shofars.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I will destroy Moab’s ruler and slaughter all officials there with him,” says Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yahweh says this: “For the three terrible crimes of Judah— no, make that four— I will not turn back my wrath because they have despised Yahweh ’s instructions and not kept his commandments. Their lies, which their ancestors followed, have led them astray.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I will send fire down on Judah to devour the fortresses of Jerusalem.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Yahweh says this: “For the three terrible crimes of Israel— no, make that four— I will not turn back my wrath. For a few pieces of silver, they sold honest people into slavery. They even sold the poor, who couldn’t pay their debts, for a pair of sandals.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They trample the poor and helpless into the dirt and shove aside the rights of the destitute. A son and his father have sex with the same woman, and by doing so, they profane my holy name.</verse>
				<verse number="8">They lay themselves down beside every altar on garments taken as security for debts, and in the house of God they drink the wine they got from those who have been fined.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorites before your very eyes. They stood as tall as cedar trees and as strong as oaks. I destroyed them root and branch.</verse>
				<verse number="10">It was I who brought you up from Egypt and led you for forty years through the desert to possess the land of the Amorites.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazirites from your young men. People of Israel, is this not true? I, Yahweh, have spoken!</verse>
				<verse number="12">“But you made the Nazirites drink wine and break their vow. You ordered the prophets, ‘You’d better not prophesy.’</verse>
				<verse number="13">Very well! I will press you down like a cart overloaded with grain.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Even the swiftest runner will not escape, physical strength will not be enough to protect the strong, nor will the mighty warrior be able to save himself.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The archer will not stand his ground, the fastest runners will not escape, nor will the one who flees on horseback save his life.</verse>
				<verse number="16">In that day, even the bravest of warriors will throw down his arms and run away. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>

			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Israelites, listen to this prophecy that Yahweh pronounces against you, against all the people I rescued from Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Of all the nations of the earth, you are the only one I have intimately known and have always cared for. That is why I will punish you for all your wrongdoings.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Does the lion roar in the bush if it has no prey? Does the lion growl in his lair if it has seized nothing?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Does a bird alight on a trap on the ground if there is no bait inside? Does the net spring up from the ground if it has caught nothing?</verse>
				<verse number="6">Does the war trumpet sound in the city without the people being frightened? Does calamity come to a city if it has not passed through Yahweh ’s hands?</verse>
				<verse number="7">Indeed, Lord Yahweh does nothing without revealing his secrets to his servants the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The lion has roared! Who is not afraid? Lord Yahweh has spoken! Who will not prophesy?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Proclaim to the strongholds of Assyria and Egypt, and say to them, “Gather on the hills around Samaria; take a good, hard look at the rampant disorder within the city and see how oppressed the people are.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“They don’t even know how to do right,” declares Yahweh. “They hoard in their palaces the spoils of their violence and extortion.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Therefore, I, Lord Yahweh, say: an enemy will soon overrun the land. He will topple your strongholds and plunder your palaces.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">This is what Yahweh says: “As a shepherd can only rescue two leg bones or a piece of an ear out of the jaws of a lion, so the Israelites who live in Samaria will only be able to salvage one leg of a bed and a piece of a headboard from their ravaged city.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“I, Lord Yahweh, the Mighty God of Angel Armies, say: Listen! Warn Jacob’s descendants.</verse>
				<verse number="14">On the day when I punish Israel for her crimes, I will also destroy the altars of Bethel. The horns of the altar will be hacked off and fall to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I will tear down the winter house of the wealthy along with your summer house. Your luxury homes decorated with ivory and your lovely mansions will likewise be destroyed. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Listen to this, you women of Samaria! You’re like the fattened, well-fed cows of Bashan grazing on the fertile mountain of Samaria. You women who exploit the weak and crush the poor and then command your husbands: “Bring us some drinks!”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness: “Behold, the day is soon coming when they will use hooks to drag you away, every last one of you with fishhooks.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They will force you like cattle in a chute through the gaps of the broken walls and herd you off toward Hermon. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Go to Bethel and sin! Go to Gilgal and sin some more! You sin when you bring your sacrifices each morning. You sin when you bring your tithes every third day</verse>
				<verse number="5">and burn your thank offerings of bread made with yeast. Brag about your extra offerings, people of Israel, for this is what makes you happy! I, Lord Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“In every town, I left you hungry — a food shortage in all your villages— and still, you would not hunger for me. I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“I even withheld the rain from you three months short of harvest. I sent rain to fall on one town but not on another. One field had plenty of rain, and another became dry as dust.</verse>
				<verse number="8">People would stagger from city to city, longing for a drink of water yet never quenching their thirst. And still you had no thirst for me. I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“I struck your crops with blight and disease and dried up your many gardens and vineyards. Locusts kept devouring your fig trees and olive trees, and still, you would not return to me. I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“I sent plagues against you like I did against Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword and stole away all your war horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your unburied corpses, and still, you would not return to me. I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“I destroyed some of you like I destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. Your survivors were like burning sticks plucked from a fire, and still, you would not return to me. I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“So here is what I plan to do to you, Israel, and because of what I am planning, prepare to meet your God.”</verse>

				<verse number="1">Listen to this funeral song that I sing over you, people of Israel:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Virgin Israel has fallen, never to rise again. There she lies, abandoned on her own soil, with no one to lift her up.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Lord Yahweh says this: “The city that deployed a thousand soldiers will only have a hundred come back, and the city that deployed a hundred soldiers will only have ten survivors.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">For Yahweh says this to the people of Israel: “ Come, seek me, and you will live.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But don’t go down to seek me at Beersheba. Don’t try to find me at Bethel’s shrines or at the altars at Gilgal. For Gilgal will be taken into exile, and Bethel will be brought to nothing.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Come back to Yahweh and live, or he will sweep down like fire upon the people of Israel. The fire will burn at Bethel with no one there to put out the flames.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They turn justice into a bitter pill to swallow and trample righteousness into the mud.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Creator of Constellations—Maker of the Pleiades and Orion, you turn the deepest darkness into dawn and daylight into the darkest night. You draw up drops of water distilled from the sea to drench the earth with pouring rain. Yahweh is your name.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You destroy the mighty with a blinding flash and overwhelm their strongholds with certain destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They hate the one who challenges injustice and despise the one who declares the whole truth in court.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For I know how outrageous are your many sins and how many crimes you have committed. You persecute the righteous, trample on the rights of the poor, and seize their grain through extortion. By taking bribes, you prevent them from getting justice in the courts. This is why you will not live in the fine stone houses you build or enjoy the fruits of your luxury. You will not drink wine from the lush vineyards you plant, for your judgment is imminent.</verse>
				<verse number="12"></verse>
				<verse number="13">Yes, the smartest thing for the prudent is to remain silent in such an evil time as this.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Devote yourself to what is good, not evil, so that you may live. And Yahweh, the God of Angel Armies, will really be with you, just as you claim he is.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Hate what is evil, love what is right, and let justice prevail in the courts. It may be that Yahweh, God of Angel Armies, will show mercy to the remnant of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Because of Israel’s sins, Lord Yahweh, God of Angel Armies, says this: “Wailing and sorrow everywhere! In every street they will mourn the dead. Those who work in the fields will be expected to mourn along with the professional mourners.</verse>
				<verse number="17">There will be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass through your midst to punish you,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Woe to you who long for the day of Yahweh! Why do you long for the day of Yahweh? Its arrival will mean darkness, not light.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You will be seized like someone who runs from a lion and a bear charges at him. Then he hides indoors and leans his hand against the wall only to have a venomous snake bite him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Will not the day of Yahweh bring darkness, not light— a day of gloom without a ray of light?</verse>
				<verse number="21">“I hate your religious festivals; I absolutely despise them! Your pious gatherings make me sick!</verse>
				<verse number="22">Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. And though you bring me choice peace offerings of fattened animals, I won’t even look at them.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Spare me the monotonous melodies of your ‘worship.’ I don’t want to hear your strumming guitars anymore. It’s just noise to me.</verse>
				<verse number="24">However, I delight in a land where justice flows like a river and where true righteousness rolls like a steady flowing stream.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Listen, people of Israel! Didn’t you worship me with your offerings and sacrifices during those forty years in the wilderness?</verse>
				<verse number="26">Now you carry around the pagan idols that you made to worship your phony king, Sakkuth, and your very own star-god, Kaiwan.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Therefore, you can carry them all the way beyond Damascus, where I am about to drive you into captivity,” says Yahweh. God of Angel Armies is his name!</verse>

				<verse number="1">Woe to you living so comfortably in Zion! Woe to you who live with a false sense of security on Mount Samaria, the elite of this foremost nation, on whom Israel’s people pin their hopes.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Travel to the city of Calneh and see for yourself what happened. Then go on from there to Hamath, the great capital city of the Hittites. Make your way down to Gath in Philistia, and ask yourself — are you better than these kingdoms? Is their territory larger than yours?</verse>
				<verse number="3">You refuse to consider the day when disaster will come, yet all your evil only brings that day closer.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Lying on luxurious beds inlaid with ivory and sprawled out on your couches, you feast on lambs from the flock and stall-fattened veal.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You compose songs like David and strum away on your harps.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You guzzle wine by the bucketful, and slather yourselves with the finest lotions. Yet you do not grieve over Israel’s impending doom.</verse>
				<verse number="7">That is why they will be the first to go into captivity. Their lying around while enjoying the good life will come to an end.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Lord Yahweh has sworn by his own being — Yahweh, God of Angel Armies, declares: “I hate the pride of the people of Jacob, and I despise their strongholds, I will hand over their capital city to their enemies and everything in it.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Even if there are ten hiding in a house, they will all die.</verse>
				<verse number="10">If a relative who is to light a memorial fire for the dead comes to carry the bodies out of the house for burial and asks, “Is anyone else inside the house with you?” and that person answers, “No,” then the one who asked will say, “Quiet! We must not mention the name of Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Behold, Yahweh strikes with his command: “Houses large and small will be smashed to pieces!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Can horses gallop over rocky cliffs? Can boulder-strewn hills be plowed with oxen? Of course not! Yet you have managed to pervert justice into poison and the sweet fruits of righteousness into bitter fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You rejoice over conquering the city of Lo Debar, saying, “Wasn’t it by our own strength that we captured Karnaim for ourselves?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">But look, house of Israel, Yahweh, God of Angel Armies, declares to you: “I will raise up a mighty nation to come against you, and they will oppress you and overrun your land from the northern to the southern borders of your kingdom.”</verse>

				<verse number="1">This is what Lord Yahweh revealed to me in a vision: Behold! Just after the hay had been cut for the king, when the new young grass started to grow again, I saw Yahweh forming a swarm of mature locusts.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I watched as they began eating all the vegetation in the land, so I pleaded with God, saying, “Lord Yahweh, please forgive us, I beg you, or we will not survive! Our nation is so helpless.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">My prayer moved God’s heart to compassion. Yahweh said: “It will not happen.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">In another vision, Yahweh revealed this to me: Behold! He was calling for punishment by fire. The scorching heat dried up the deep sources of water beneath the land and made the farmlands like dust.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So I pleaded with God, saying, “Lord Yahweh, please don’t do this, I beg you, or we will not survive! Our nation is so helpless.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Because of my prayer, God’s heart was stirred with compassion. “This also will not happen,” said Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Lord Yahweh revealed this to me in another vision: I saw the Lord standing by a wall built true to plumb, holding a plumb line in his hand.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Amos, what do you see?” Yahweh asked me. “A plumb line,” I replied. Then the Lord said, “Behold, I am about to set a plumb line up against my people Israel to test them. Never again will I look the other way when they sin.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I will destroy the high places where Isaac’s descendants worship, and I will ruin the holy places of Israel. With my sword in hand, I will attack the dynasty of Jeroboam.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Amaziah the chief priest of Bethel sent the following message to Jeroboam king of Israel: “Amos has conspired against you in the very heart of Israel. We cannot stand his speeches!</verse>
				<verse number="11">For Amos says, ‘Jeroboam is going to die by the sword, and Israel will go into captivity far from its native land.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Amaziah said to Amos, “Go away, you seer. Why don’t you escape to Judah while there is time? You can always prophesy there and make your living.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But don’t stay around here and prophesy at Bethel anymore. This is the national temple, the place where the king worships.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Amos replied, “I am not a prophet, nor am I one of the sons of the prophets. I am merely a rancher, and I cultivate fig trees.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But one day, Yahweh called me as I was managing my flocks and said to me, ‘Go and prophesy to my people Israel.’</verse>
				<verse number="16">“So now, Amaziah, listen to what Yahweh says. You say: ‘Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not prophesy doom on Isaac’s descendants!’</verse>
				<verse number="17">Very well. This is what Yahweh says: ‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the streets, and your sons and daughters will fall in battle. Your land will be measured, divided up, and given to others. And you yourself will die in a pagan land, and Israel will go into captivity far from its own land!’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Lord Yahweh revealed this to me in another vision: a basket of ripe fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Amos, what do you see?” he asked. “A basket of ripe fruit,” I replied. Then Yahweh said, “The time is ripe for my people Israel. I will not continue to overlook their sins.</verse>
				<verse number="3">On that day, those singing songs in the temple will wail instead,” declares the Lord Yahweh. “There will be corpses piled up everywhere. They will be cast out in silence.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Listen to this, all you who trample on the poor and reduce the needy to nothing!</verse>
				<verse number="5">You say to yourselves, “We can’t wait for these holy days to be over so that we can sell our corn!” And, “When will this Sabbath be over so that we can open the storage and sell our wheat? Then we can overcharge our customers, shortchange them, and deceive them by tampering with the scales.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We can even sell the worthless chaff we sweep up for silver. We can buy the poor with silver and make them our slaves because they cannot pay their debts, even a debt so small as that of a pair of sandals.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yahweh, the Majesty of Jacob, has sworn an oath: “I will never forget all the evil they have done.</verse>
				<verse number="8">That is why the earth will tremble for this, and all who live on it mourn. All of the land will rise up like the river Nile— inundated and stirred up by floodwaters— and then subside, just like the river of Egypt!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“On that day,” declares Lord Yahweh, “I will make the sun set at noon and darken the earth in the middle of the day.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I will turn your festivals into funerals, and all your lively singing into funeral dirges. I will make you all wear sackcloth and shave your heads, as if you were mourning the death of an only child. That day will be bitter to the end.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Behold, the days are coming,” declares Lord Yahweh, “when I will send a famine on the land. People will not hunger for food nor thirst for water but will starve for a word from Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="12">People will stagger from sea to sea and wander from the north to the east searching for a revelation from Yahweh, but they will not hear from me.</verse>
				<verse number="13">On that day, even your beautiful young women and strong young men will collapse from thirst.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Those who swear by Ashimah, the idol of Samaria, who say, ‘Long live your golden calf-god of Dan!’ and say, ‘As surely as the god of Beersheba lives!’— they will all fall, never to rise again.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">I saw the Lord standing over the altar, and he gave the command: “Smash the top of the pillars so that the foundations shake! Shatter the pillars and make them crumble upon the heads of all the worshipers. And any survivors I will kill by the sword. Whoever runs away will not go far. Whoever tries to escape will not make it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Even if they were to dig their way down to the underworld, my hand would haul them out. Even if they were to climb up to heaven, I would drag them down from there.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If they were to hide on top of Mount Carmel, I would hunt them down and snatch them. If they were to try to hide from my eyes at the bottom of the sea, I would order the serpent there to bite them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">If their enemies were to herd them into captivity, even there I would order the sword to kill them. Yes, I will fix my eyes on them to destroy them and not to help them.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Lord Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, you touch the earth and it melts, and everyone on earth mourns. All of the land will rise up like the river Nile— inundated and stirred up by floodwaters— and then subside, just like the river of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You build your lofty stairway in the heavens and suspend your superdome over the earth. You summon the waters of the sea and pour them over the face of the earth: Yahweh is your name!</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Israel, I think as much of the Ethiopians as I do of you; you’re all the same to me,” declares Yahweh. “ Yes, I brought you out from Egypt. But didn’t I also bring out the Philistines from Crete and the Syrians from Kir?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Behold, the eyes of Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom of Israel. I will wipe it off the face of the earth. Yet I will not completely destroy the descendants of Jacob,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Behold, I will speak the command to scatter the people of Israel among all the nations. I will sift them the way sand is shaken in a sieve, through which not a single pebble falls to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="10">All the sinners of my people will die by the sword who say, ‘Nothing bad could ever happen to us.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11">“One day I will restore David’s tabernacle that has fallen. I will repair its broken places and raise up its ruins and fix it up like new. I will rebuild it and make it what it was long ago.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As a result, David’s people will conquer the nations over which they once ruled for me, down to the last remnant of Edom.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Behold, I, Yahweh, make this decree: The days of acceleration are coming, when the harvest will be so great that those plowing the field will overtake those still reaping the harvest, and the ones treading the grapes will overtake those who are planting. Blessings will stream forth like new wine pouring from every mountain, and every hill will flow with favor.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will restore prosperity and good fortune to the captives of Israel. They will rebuild the ruined cities to live in. They will plant vineyards to produce their wine. And plant lush gardens and orchards to eat their produce.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And I will plant them in their own land, never to be uprooted again from the land that I have given them. I, Yahweh, your God, have spoken.”</verse>

				<verse number="1">This is the vision that Lord Yahweh revealed to Obadiah concerning Edom. We have heard a report from Yahweh: “I have sent a messenger throughout the nations, saying, ‘Rise up! Let us march against this people. Prepare for war!’</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Behold, I have reduced you to the least among the nations. You are now utterly despised.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Your proud heart has deceived you; you who are perched in the hidden places of the rock, whose home is in the heights. You think to yourself, ‘Who can ever topple me to the ground?’</verse>
				<verse number="4">Though you soar like an eagle, and your nest is nestled among the stars, I am more than able to bring you down from there. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">“When thieves come at night to rob your home, wouldn’t they only steal the things they wanted? When people gather grapes, wouldn’t they miss a few and leave some gleanings behind? But you, Edom—your enemies will totally destroy you!</verse>
				<verse number="6">How Esau’s descendants will be looted, their hidden treasures sought out and ransacked!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Your allies will deceive you. They will overpower you and chase you off your homeland. Your ‘trusted friends’ will lay a trap for you, and you’ll have no clue it’s coming.</verse>
				<verse number="8">In that day, will I not destroy all the wise men of Edom and erase all their pseudo -intelligence from the mountains of Esau? I, Yahweh, have spoken.</verse>

				<verse number="11">You deserted Israel at her time of need. On that day of infamy, you stood aloof and did nothing as foreigners broke through the city gates of Jerusalem and divided the city among themselves by casting lots. Strangers carried off all her treasures, and you were as one with the invaders.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Do not gloat over your relatives on the day of their misfortune. Do not rejoice over the people of Judah on the day of their ruin. Do not boast that they suffered such anguish.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You should not have entered my people’s city on their day of calamity. You should not have feasted your eyes on their suffering on their day of misery. You should not have seized their wealth on their day of sorrow.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">One day Yahweh revealed to Jonah, Amittai’s son, this message:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Arise! Leave at once for the great city of Nineveh and proclaim judgment against her, for the wickedness of her people is staring me in the face.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">But Jonah bolted and ran in the opposite direction, determined to run away from the presence of Yahweh. He went down to the coastal city of Joppa and found a ship bound for Tarshish. He paid his fare, went down into the hold of the ship, and set sail for Tarshish to flee from the presence of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But Yahweh unleashed a powerful, violent wind on the sea. The ship was caught in such a great tempest that it was in jeopardy of shattering.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The sailors were terrified. Each of them began to call on his own god for help. In order to lighten the ship they hurled the cargo and tackle overboard. Jonah, however, had gone down below and lain down in the hold and was fast asleep.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The captain went below and asked Jonah, “How can you be sleeping so soundly at a time like this? Get up! Call on your god! Maybe he will feel sorry for us and not leave us to die.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then the sailors said to each other, “Come on. Let’s cast lots to find out who is to blame for bringing us this calamity.” They cast lots, and the lot pointed to Jonah.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So they interrogated him. “Tell us,” they said, “what is the purpose of your journey? Where do you come from? What is your country, and who are your people?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“I’m a Hebrew,” he replied. “I worship the God of heaven, the Creator of both sea and dry land. His name is Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jonah added, “ I am his prophet, but I’m trying to escape from him.” Hearing this, the sailors were gripped with fear and said, “What terrible thing have you done?</verse>
				<verse number="11">What can we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?” Even as they spoke, the storm and waves were getting worse and worse.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Jonah said, “It’s all my fault that you are caught in this violent storm. So just pick me up and throw me into the sea, and it will calm down for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Reluctant to sacrifice Jonah, the sailors rowed frantically trying to return to shore, but they got nowhere. All the while, the sea was raging even wilder than before.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Losing hope, they began to pray to Yahweh and said, “Please, Yahweh, God of Jonah, don’t let us perish on account of Jonah. And don’t hold it against us for throwing this man overboard. For you, Yahweh, have acted in accordance with your will.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So the sailors took hold of Jonah and tossed him into the foaming sea. Then all at once, the sea stopped raging.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Awestruck, the men were gripped with the fear of Yahweh, and they made vows and offered sacrifices to Jonah’s God, Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Meanwhile, Yahweh directed a huge fish to be at that very spot in order to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was kept alive in the stomach of the fish for three days and three nights.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">This is Jonah’s prayer to Yahweh, his God, from out of the darkness inside the huge fish:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“I called out to Yahweh from a place of total desperation and he answered me. From inside the belly of Sheol I cried out, and you heard my voice.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The waters closed in all around me; all your mighty waves and currents crashed over me. For you cast me into the deep, and I sank down to the bottom of the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I actually assumed that you had banished me from your sight. Yet, I know that I will one day gaze again upon your holy temple.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The waters rose to choke me to death. The sea was closing in around me— seaweed tightened around my head.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I sank down into the abyss, to the roots of the mountains, where the barred gates of that realm would lock me in forever. But you, Yahweh, are my God; you raised my life from the pit.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When my life was ebbing away, my thoughts turned toward you. My cries rose before you in your holy, heavenly temple, and my prayer entered your heart, Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="8">It’s true —some abandon faithful love to you by worshiping worthless idols.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But I will sing songs of praise and offer my sacrifices to you. I will keep every vow I’ve made to you, Yahweh, for salvation comes only from you.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto the dry land.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to the prophet Jonah for the second time.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Arise!” he said. “Leave at once for the great city of Nineveh and preach to the people the message I give you.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">This time, Jonah set out for Nineveh in obedience to the word of Yahweh. Now Nineveh was a very important city to God. It took three days to traverse the entire city.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When Jonah entered the city, he walked a day’s journey and began to preach: “ God will destroy this city in forty days!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The people of Nineveh believed Jonah’s message and turned to God. To show they had repented, they called for a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, took off his royal robe, put on sackcloth, and sat down in ashes.</verse>
				<verse number="7">He then issued this proclamation: “People of Nineveh, by decree of the king and his nobles, no person or animal, herd or flock, may eat anything; they must not consume any food or water.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Each of you must cover yourself and your livestock with burlap and call on God with all your might. Everyone must turn away from his or her evil ways and violent behavior.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Who knows? Perhaps God may show us mercy and be willing to change his mind. Perhaps he will relent and turn from unleashing his fierce anger so that we will not die.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">When God saw their sincere efforts to turn from their wicked ways, he decided not to punish the people of Nineveh and did not bring upon them the disaster he said would come.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Jonah was extremely upset that God would show mercy to Nineveh. Indignant, he fell into a rage.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He prayed to Yahweh and said, “God, I knew this is what would happen even before I left home. For I know that you are a tender, compassionate God, who is extremely patient, rich in faithful love. And I know you are always ready to relent from inflicting disaster. That was why I attempted to flee to Tarshish.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So now, Yahweh, please take my life, for death seems better to me than life.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yahweh replied, “What good reason do you have to be so angry?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Jonah went out east of Nineveh, where he made himself a makeshift shelter. He sat there under its shade waiting to see what would happen to the city.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now Lord Yahweh arranged for a gourd plant to grow up over Jonah to provide him shade to rest in and to soothe his sour demeanor. Jonah was thrilled with the plant.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But at dawn the next day, God sent a worm to chew through the plant—and it withered.</verse>
				<verse number="8">As the sun rose into the sky, God sent a scorching east wind. The wind and blazing sun beat down so hard on Jonah’s head that he was starting to faint. So he begged God to end his life, saying, “I’m better off dead than alive.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">God said to Jonah, “Are you right to be so angry about the plant that gave you shade?” He replied, “I have every right to be angry, angry enough to die!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yahweh replied, “You are concerned for the vine, which you did not plant, nor did you do anything to make it grow. It sprang up one night and died the next.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Should I not have compassion for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than 120,000 people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, to say nothing of all the animals?”</verse>

		<book number="33">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">This is the prophetic message Yahweh revealed to Micah of Moresheth. He delivered these prophecies during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. These are his supernatural visions concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Listen, you peoples—all of you! Earth, pay attention —and everyone on it. From his holy temple, the Lord Yahweh himself will testify against you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For behold, Yahweh is leaving his dwelling place. Here he comes to tread upon the high places of the land.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Mountains melt beneath his feet, like wax melting near a raging fire. Valleys are split wide open, like water pouring down a steep slope.</verse>
				<verse number="5">All of this is because of the rebellion of Jacob’s tribes, the sin of the people of Israel. So who is to blame for the rebellion of Jacob? Is it not the people of Samaria? Who is to blame for the idolatry of the high places of Judah? Is it not the people of Jerusalem?</verse>
				<verse number="6">“So I will wrestle Samaria to the ground, and she will become nothing more than an open field for planting vines. I will roll the stones of her buildings down into the valley until I have laid bare her foundations.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will hammer to pieces all her gilded pagan idols, all the gifts given to her sacred prostitutes will be scorched by fire. I will turn all her precious idols into a pile of rubble. For she—Samaria—gathered her treasured idols as a prostitute collects her fees, and now these idols will become a prostitute’s wages again.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">I will mourn and wail because of this. I will walk around barefoot and bare to show my sorrow. I will howl like a jackal and mourn like an owl.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For her wound is incurable, and her infection is spreading to Judah. It has even reached the gateway of my people, to Jerusalem itself.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Show no tears in Showtown (Gath). People of Dusty House (Beth Leaphrah), wallow in the dust of your despair!</verse>
				<verse number="11">You’ll take a different path, Glamour-Girl-Town (Shaphir); you’ll go into exile naked and ashamed. You citizens of Outbound City (Zaanan) are stuck at home. Your next-door neighbor (Beth Ezel) is in mourning and will no longer be able to help you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The women of Bitterville (Maroth) writhed in labor pains, hoping for good to come. Instead, Yahweh sent down disaster all the way to the gates of Jerusalem itself.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Start up your chariots, you people of Ponytown (Lachish), for the sin of the daughter of Zion can be traced back to you, where Israel’s sin began.</verse>
				<verse number="14">People of Judah, give gifts to Moresheth Gath, as you would to a daughter who is leaving home to be married. The Domiciles of Deception (Beth Achzib) will deceive the kings of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="15">People of Mareshah, Yahweh will again bring a conqueror against you, and the glory of Israel will flee to the cave of Adullam.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Cut off your hair and make yourselves bald, for your delightful children are taken away. Make yourselves as bald as a vulture, for your children have been taken away from you into exile.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Disaster is ahead for those who plot evil. They’re as good as dead! Disaster is ahead for those who scheme as they lie on their bed. No sooner is it dawn than they act on their plan just because they can.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They covet someone’s field and seize it for themselves, and they take over his house as well. They defraud a man of his home and another man of his inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So here’s what Yahweh has to say about that: “Now I am the one plotting a disaster for those who plot to defraud others, a disaster from which you cannot escape. You will no longer walk with heads held high, for a catastrophe will bring you low.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And when that time comes, people will adopt a taunting proverb about you and sing this mournful song to mock your sad experience: ‘We have lost everything! God has divided up our people’s lands with no one left to restore it to our hands. Our property has been seized and given to our captors—the traitors.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Because of this, when Yahweh restores the land to his people, those corrupt leaders will have no stake in Yahweh ’s assembly nor have any part in the distribution of land.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They berate me continually. “Don’t prophesy,” they say to me. “Don’t keep prophesying on and on about these things! Disgrace will not overtake us.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Should Jacob’s descendants even be asking, “Is the Spirit of Yahweh really so short-tempered that he would do such things to us?” “When I speak, don’t my words produce good within the one who obeys them?</verse>
				<verse number="8">But you wealthy oppressors of the poor have become like enemies attacking my people. When men return home from war and think they are finally safe at home, there you are, ready to snatch the coats off their backs as security for the money they owe you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You wrongly evict the women of my people from the very homes they love, forever depriving their children of the honor of their inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Get up and get out! This is no longer your resting place. Because of this defilement, I will completely destroy you, and your destruction will be severe beyond measure.</verse>
				<verse number="11">If a lying windbag comes to deceive you, saying, ‘I prophesy wine and liquor will flow for you,’ he would be the ideal prophet for a people like this.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">“I will regather the tribes of Jacob. Yes, I will regather the remnant of Israel. I will bring you together like sheep in a fold, like a flock within their pasture, a noisy, excited multitude.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“The Barrier-Breaker will lead them out into freedom. They will all break out, passing through the enemy’s gates. Their king will advance before their eyes with Yahweh himself leading the way!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Then I said, “Listen, you leaders of the tribes of Jacob, you princes among the people of Israel. Is it not your duty to see that justice prevails?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yet you hate what is good and love what is evil. You skin my people alive, pulling the flesh off their bones.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Like butchers, you tear the skin off my people. You break their bones and chop them up like stew meat for the pot. Like wild animals, you rip the flesh off their bones and devour my people.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then you will cry out to him, but he will not answer your prayers. Yahweh will hide his face from you rulers because you have totally misused your power.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Here is what Yahweh says against the prophets who lead my people so far from the truth: “So long as they pay you, you prophesy peace. But if they don’t, you threaten war.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So, darkness will close in around you, and you will receive no prophetic visions. A shroud of darkness will bring your predictions to an end. The sun will set for the prophets, and the daylight will go dark for them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then shame will silence the seers. Confusion will cover those who predict the future. Humiliated, they will all put their hands over their mouths because there is no word from God.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Not so with me, for I am full of power! Yahweh ’s breath fills me with a sense of justice and courage to expose the rebellion of Jacob’s tribes and the sin of the people of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now hear this, you leaders of the tribes of Jacob, you princes of the people of Israel: You hate justice and distort right into wrong.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Indeed, you build up Zion and Jerusalem but upon an immoral foundation of murder and malice.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Her judges render verdicts for the highest bidder, her priests preach for a price, her prophets prophesy for a fee, and yet they pretend to depend upon Yahweh. “Isn’t Yahweh on our side?” they say. “How could any disaster come upon us?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">That is why, thanks to you, Zion will return to farmland, Jerusalem to a pile of rubble, and the Temple Mount will be deserted — overgrown with thickets.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">In the future, the mountain of Yahweh ’s temple will be raised up as the head of the mountains, towering over all the hills. A sparkling stream of every nation will flow into it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Many peoples will come and say, “Everyone, come! Let’s go up higher to Yahweh ’s mountain, to the house of Jacob’s God; then he can teach us his ways, and we can walk in his paths.” Zion will be the center of instruction, and the word of Yahweh will go out from Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He will judge fairly between strong, distant nations and settle disputes among many peoples. The swords they used against each other they will beat into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. No nation will take up weapons against another, nor will they prepare for war anymore.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But everyone will relax under their own fig trees and vineyards with no one to trouble them. For Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has decreed it.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Though all the nations walk in the name of their own gods, we will walk in the name of Yahweh, our God, forever and ever.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I, Yahweh, declare: “In that day of hope I will gather the lame and bring together the wandering outcasts and those whom I have bruised.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will make a new beginning with those who are crippled and far from home. My remnant will be transformed into a mighty nation. And I, Yahweh, will reign over them on Mount Zion from now and throughout eternity.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“And to you, Tower of the Flock, where the daughter of Zion is lifted up, your royal dominion will arrive. His kingship will come to you, Daughter Jerusalem.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Why are you wailing? Why are you writhing like a woman in labor? Have you no king to help you? And your wise leader, has he perished?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Groan and writhe in anguish, like a woman in hard labor, daughter of Zion, for now, you must leave the city and live out in the open field. Off to Babylon you must go! Yet, one day you will be rescued from there, for Yahweh will deliver you from the clutches of your enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Many nations have now gathered to attack you. They say, “Let’s destroy Jerusalem so that we can gloat over capturing Zion.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">But they do not know Yahweh ’s plans, and they do not understand his strategy: he has brought them together to punish them, like grain is brought to be beaten on the threshing floor to separate the good from the worthless.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Arise, start your threshing, daughter of Zion, for I will make you strong as a bull with iron horns and bronze hooves so that you can crush many peoples. And you must devote to Yahweh what they have stolen and bring their wealth to me, the Lord of the whole earth.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Now you are walled in. They have laid siege against us. They smack the ruler of Israel’s face with a rod.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, so small among the clans of Judah, from your people will come a ruler who will rule Israel for me. He will burst forth from the first sunrise from the days of eternity!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Therefore, Yahweh will hand Israel over to her enemies until the labor pains are over and the child is born. And then the remnant of his brothers in exile will be reunited with the Israelites.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He will take his stand and will lead and feed his flock with the strength that comes from Yahweh and with the majesty of the name of his God. With this shepherd, they will live in safety, for his greatness will extend to the ends of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He himself will be their peace. When the Assyrian army sets foot on our soil to invade our land, we will raise up more than enough mighty captains to conquer them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They will shepherd the Assyrians with the sword, the land of Nimrod with the drawn sword. And Yahweh will deliver us from the Assyrians, when they invade our land and tread on our territory.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then the remnant of Jacob will be scattered among many peoples. They will be like the refreshing dew from Yahweh, like raindrops on the meadows, which do not wait on man’s command and are beyond human control.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the scattered remnant of Jacob will live among the nations. They will be like lions among the animals of the forest, like fierce lions among flocks of sheep, they will pounce on their prey with no one to rescue.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You will be victorious over your foes, and all your enemies will be torn to pieces.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“When that day comes,” declares Yahweh, “I will destroy your horses and demolish your chariots.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I will destroy the cities of your country and tear down all your strongholds.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will dismantle the witchcraft in your land, and you will no longer cast spells.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I shall tear away your idols and your sacred stone pillars from among you. You will no longer worship things that your own hands have made.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I will uproot your sacred poles and level your cities.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I will punish with furious anger the nations who have disobeyed me.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Now listen to what Yahweh says: “Stand up and state your case. The mountains will be your witnesses, so let the hills hear your defense.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Listen, mountains, to Yahweh ’s accusation; pay attention, you enduring foundations of the earth, for I, Yahweh, have an indictment against my people, and I will prosecute my case against Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="3">My people, what have I done to deserve your neglect? How have I made you tired of me? Answer me!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Did I not rescue you from Egypt and ransom you from slavery? I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Please remember this, my people: King Balak of Moab planned to curse you, and how did the prophet Balaam son of Beor answer him? He spoke Yahweh ’s blessing over you! Remember how I parted the Jordan so that you could cross over from Acacia to Gilgal. Now you should know through all my saving acts that I have treated you fairly.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">What should I bring when I enter Yahweh ’s presence and bow down before God Most High? Should I approach him with burnt offerings, with year-old calves to sacrifice?</verse>
				<verse number="7">Will he be pleased with thousands of rams and with endless streams of olive oil? Should I offer him my firstborn for my wrongdoing, my own offspring for the sins of my life?</verse>
				<verse number="8">No! Listen, O Adam’s offspring, Yahweh has made it plain to you what is best. He has shown you what he really is longing for from you— only to promote justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh ’s voice is calling out to the city. Wise is the one who fears the name of Yahweh. “So pay attention, O tribe, to the one who called you together!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Can I overlook the treasures that fill the homes of evil people who cheated others? They use false measures, which I despise.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Do you really expect me to forgive those who cheat others with a bag of wrong weights and dishonest scales?</verse>
				<verse number="12">The wealthy are steeped in violence, and the people are liars and speak deceitfully.</verse>
				<verse number="13">As for me, I will deal you a crippling blow to ruin you for your sins.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You will eat but not be satisfied; you will still be hungry. You will acquire but save nothing because what you save, I will send your enemies to destroy.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You will plant crops but not reap a harvest, press olives for its oil and never be able to rub it on yourselves, and tread grapes but never drink the wine.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For you live by the standards of the dynasty of Omri and follow the evil ways of Ahab and his household. Because you walk after their example, you force me to make an example out of you! I will hand you over to ruin and make you a laughingstock among the nations. People everywhere will treat you with contempt.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">I’m so depressed and disappointed, like a hungry man who went to the field after the harvest had been gathered and found nothing remaining, not even the gleanings— nor a single cluster of grapes nor any of those firstfruit figs I love.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The godly have vanished from the land: there is not a decent person left. They are all out for each other’s blood, they hunt each other with a net.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Concerning evil, both hands do it well. Officials and judges ask for bribes, the man in power pronounces whatever he pleases, and the prominent plot as one.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The best and brightest is like a briar bush, the most honest of them like a thorn hedge. Now here comes the punishment your prophets proclaimed. Confusion confronts you!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Don’t dare to trust in a neighbor or place your confidence in a friend. Watch your words even with the wife you love.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For the son insults his father, the daughter rebels against her mother, and the daughter-in-law quarrels with her mother-in-law. One’s enemies come from within your own household.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But as for me, I will keep watching for Yahweh to break through. I will wait for the God who will save me, and I know my God will hear my cry.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Listen, my enemy. Don’t gloat over me when I fall, for I will get back up even stronger. Whenever I feel darkness around me, Yahweh himself will be the light that surrounds me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I must endure Yahweh ’s anger for a while because I have sinned against him. Yet he will still defend my cause and right every wrong done to me. He will expose it all and bring me out into the light, and I will experience firsthand his vindication.</verse>
				<verse number="10">When my enemy sees this, she will be disgraced and covered with shame— she who sneered, “Where is this God of yours, Yahweh?” I’ll see it with my own eyes as she is trampled down like mud in the streets.</verse>
				<verse number="11">What a day that will be! A day for rebuilding your walls! A day for expanding your borders!</verse>
				<verse number="12">A day when people come to you from everywhere— from the cities of Assyria, Egypt, and Tyre and all the way from the river Euphrates, from across the seas, and from every mountainous land.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Those lands will become desolate because of the corruption of their inhabitants.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Our kind Shepherd, watch over us, the flock that is your special inheritance. With your staff, lead your people to pasture. For we are like a flock confined to live in a forest with meadowland all around us. Let us graze again in the fertile fields of Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“I will show you mighty miracles as in the days when you came out of Egypt.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">When the nations see your miracles, they will be ashamed, seeing that their power counts for nothing. They will put their hands over their mouths, too dumbfounded by your might to even speak, and their ears will become deaf.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Let them lick the dust like snakes, like the crawling things of the earth. Let them come slinking out of their strongholds, trembling in terror before you, Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Who is a merciful God like you? Your grace wipes the slate clean of guilt and pardons the rebellion of the remnant of your people. You don’t hold your anger against us forever, but you delight in showing faithful, tender love.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Once more we ask: have tender mercy on us, tread our iniquities under your feet, and hurl all our sins to the bottom of the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You will demonstrate endless faithfulness to Jacob’s tribes and to Abraham’s descendants your constant love, just like you swore to our ancestors in ancient times.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">This is the book of the vision of Nahum who was from the village of Elkosh. A prophecy concerning Nineveh:</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh is a God who tolerates no rivals. Lord Yahweh will take vengeance on his foes. He punishes his adversaries and keeps wrath for his enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh is very slow to anger but so great in power; Yahweh will not let the guilty go unpunished. He marches out in the whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He rebukes the sea and dries it up and makes all the rivers run dry. At his rebuke, the lush meadows of Bashan and Carmel wither; the flowering fields of Lebanon fade.</verse>
				<verse number="5">In his presence, the mountains quake and the hills melt away. When he appears, the earth heaves, and the world and all who dwell in it are laid waste.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Who can stand before an angry God? Who can face his fiery fury? When his wrath erupts, it pours out like lava, and boulders are broken to bits as he approaches.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The goodness of Yahweh is beyond belief! For when trouble comes, we run into his heart and hide. He always cares for those who seek refuge in him.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But with an overwhelming flood, he will make a complete end of Nineveh, and darkness will overtake his enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Whatever evil plot you hatch against Yahweh, he will so completely thwart that it will not rise up a second time.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They will be like drunkards from their carousing— like entangled thorns, they will be consumed as dry stubble.</verse>
				<verse number="11">From you, Nineveh, came one who plotted evil against Yahweh, a wicked, worthless strategist.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yahweh says, “Although your enemies are many and secure in their alliances, they will nonetheless be mowed down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, my people, I will not do it again.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And now I will break his yoke of bondage from your neck and tear away your shackles of Assyrian oppression.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yahweh has decreed against you, Nineveh: “Your dynasty is over! Every idol in the temple of your gods I will destroy, your carved and engraved idols. I will dig your grave, for you are nothing to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">What a beautiful sight to behold— the precious feet of the messenger coming over the mountains to announce good news and to proclaim peace! People of Judah, celebrate your feasts, keep your solemn promises to God, for the wicked one will never pass through you again; he is completely cut off.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Nineveh, an attacker is poised to advance against you. Place your guards along the top of the walls; set lookouts on the road. Go ahead, get ready for battle; gather all your forces, but it will be in vain.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For Yahweh is about to restore the majesty of Jacob and Israel her glory. For you have plundered everything and ruined their vineyards.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The invading soldiers’ shields are scarlet, each warrior robed in red. The metal of the Babylonian chariots gleams like fire on the day they are made ready for battle, and the wooden spears are brandished in anticipation.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The chariots race madly through the streets of Nineveh; they dash wildly through the public squares, gleaming like torches, darting like lightning.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The king of Assyria summons his elite commanders, but they stumble while attempting to advance. The attackers run swiftly to the city wall; the protective canopy for the battering ram is set up.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The floodgates are opened; the royal palace is inundated by the surging torrent and collapses.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Nineveh is stripped, taken captive, and carried into exile. Her maidservants moan like doves and beat their breasts in sorrow.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The people rush out of Nineveh like water pours out of a broken dam. The officers shout, “Stop! Stop!” but no one turns back.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Plunder the silver, plunder the gold! Look! There is no end of the treasure — heaps of every precious thing.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Desolation! Devastation! Destruction! Hearts melting, knees knocking, stomachs churning, faces turning pale.</verse>
				<verse number="11">What has happened now to the lions’ den where the fierce lions were fed, where the lion and lioness once lived, where the cubs frolicked, cozy and fearless?</verse>
				<verse number="12">Like a lion, Assyria once killed his prey and tore it to pieces, filling his cave with meat for his mate and her cubs.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Behold, I am your enemy,” declares Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. “I will burn your chariots to ashes, and the sword will slaughter your young lions. No longer will you prey upon the land, and your messengers will announce no more victories.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Doomed is the city of bloodshed, embodiment of treachery and thievery, where the murdering never stops!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Listen to the crack of the whip, the rumble of the chariot wheels, the thunder of horses’ hooves, and charging chariots.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Horsemen advancing, gleaming swords and glistening spears, hosts of slain, heaps of corpses, dead bodies, too many to count. People stumble over the carcasses.</verse>
				<verse number="4">This is because you lustfully lured the nations like a wanton whore. You acted so gracefully, yet you are a mistress of witchcraft. You sold entire nations into the sex trade and bewitched whole families into slavery.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Behold, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, declares to you: “I am your enemy! I will lift up your skirt over your face, and I will make nations gawk at your nakedness and kingdoms at your shame.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I will pelt you with filth and make you an object of scorn and will treat you with contempt.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And all who look at you will turn their backs on you and say, ‘Poor Nineveh is a pile of rubble; who will grieve for you? Who will have sympathy for you?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Are you any better than Thebes, which once sat by the Nile surrounded by water, her moat of defense, a mighty river?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Ethiopia and Egypt were her endless strength; Somalia and Libya were her helpful allies.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yet the people of Thebes became exiles and were carried off into captivity. Their infants were dashed to pieces on every street corner. They cast lots for her honored men— all the best and brightest were bound in chains and taken captive.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You will fall into a drunken stupor. You will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy.</verse>
				<verse number="12">All your fortified cities are like fig trees with first-ripe figs: shake the tree and they fall right into the open mouth of the eater.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Behold, all who remain in the midst of your cities are the women. The borders of your land are wide open to your enemies. Fire will devour your fortresses.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Go ahead and draw plenty of water and prepare for the siege. Strengthen your defenses. Get mud, trample the clay, make more bricks.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yet the fire will devour you there. You will be slaughtered by the sword. It will consume you like locusts. You multiplied like hopping locusts and like swarming grasshoppers.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Your merchants multiplied until they were more than the stars in the sky. Like locusts they stripped the land, spread their wings, and flew away.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Your officials were as numerous as grasshoppers, your scribes like a swarm of locusts. On a cold day, they settle on the stone fences, but when the sun appears, they abandon you and fly away; no one knows where they are.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Emperor of Assyria, your shepherds slumber, your nobles nod off to sleep soundly. All your people are like sheep scattered on the mountains with no one to bring them home.</verse>
				<verse number="19">There is no remedy for your injuries; your wound is fatal. All who hear the news about you applaud for joy over your downfall. For whoever was untouched by your endless evil?</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">This is the vision of Habakkuk the prophet:</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh, how long must I cry for help and you turn a deaf ear? My heart cries out, “Save us from this brutality!” but you do not save.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Why do you make me stare at injustice? Why do you tolerate such trouble and wrongdoing? Destruction and violence surround me; strife and conflict are everywhere.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Therefore, the law is not enforced, and so justice never prevails. The wicked overwhelm the righteous so that justice is perverted.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Look at the nations and observe— you’ll be stunned by what you see. For while you watch, I am about to do something so surprising in your days that you would not believe it even if you were told.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I am raising up the Babylonians to punish you — that fierce and fearsome people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize houses they do not own.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They are a feared and dreaded people. In their autocratic arrogance, they become a law unto themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves on the prowl at dusk. Their cavalry charges headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They soar swiftly like an eagle swooping to devour.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Their armies invade, intent on violent conquest. Their terrifying hordes advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners as numerous as grains of sand.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They are a people who mock kings and scoff at those in authority. They laugh at every stronghold; they pile up earthen siege ramps and capture them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then they hurry on, like the wind that blows by and disappears. They are guilty men who worship their own power as if it were a god.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yahweh, have you not always been the everlasting God? You are my God, my Holy One, who will not die. Yahweh, you have appointed the Babylonians to execute judgment; my Rock, you have raised them up so they can punish us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Your eyes are so pure that you cannot stand the sight of evil; nor do you look on wickedness with favor. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you so silent while sinners devour those more righteous than themselves?</verse>
				<verse number="14">Have you only made us like fish, to be caught and killed by the wicked; like swarming schools of fish with no ruler?</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the Babylonians pull them up with fishhooks and drag them in with their nets. Gleefully, they gather them up in their dragnets, shouting for joy over their catch.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They even offer sacrifices and burn incense in honor of their nets, as if these were gods. For their nets enable them to live luxuriously and eat the finest food.</verse>
				<verse number="17">How long will you allow them to fill and empty their throw nets? Will they forever destroy nations without mercy?</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">I will wait at my watchpost and station myself on the tower. I’ll keep watching to see what he’ll say to me and consider the reply when he answers my argument.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then Yahweh replied: “Write down the revelation; write it legibly on clay tablets so that whoever reads it may run and explain it to others.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The vision still awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove to be false. When the appointed time comes, it will happen with breathless haste. Although it may seem slow, just be patient and wait. For it will surely come right on time.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Look at the proud, puffed up with pride! They are crooked to the core. But the righteous will live by his faith.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Wealth is deceitful. The proud are full of themselves but have empty souls. They are as greedy as the grave. And just like death itself, they are never satisfied. They gather and grasp for themselves all the wealth of the nations and take all the people captive.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“All these conquered nations will one day taunt them, saying, ‘You are doomed, you who pile up stolen goods! How long will you amass wealth by extortion?’</verse>
				<verse number="7">Will not your creditors suddenly arise? Will they not wake up and terrify you? Before you know it, you will become their prey.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Since you have plundered many nations, the peoples who are left will plunder you. For you have killed many people; you have acted violently against lands and cities and everyone within them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“You are doomed, you who enrich your family by cheating others! You build your luxurious home on high thinking you’ll be safe from harm’s reach.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Your schemes to ruin the lives and homes of others bring shame upon your own house. You are as good as dead for doing this.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The stones of the wall will cry out to accuse you, and your wooden rafters will echo it.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“You are doomed, you who build a city with bloodshed and establish it upon evil!</verse>
				<verse number="13">I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, have decreed: The efforts of the nations are nothing but fuel for the fire, for all they have built will go up in smoke.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yet the entire earth is being filled with the revelation of the glory of Yahweh, just as waters fill the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“You are doomed, you who delight to mix drinks for neighbors, pouring wine from pitchers until they are dead drunk just so that you can gaze on their naked bodies!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now you will be drunk with shame instead of honor. Now it is your turn! Drink your fill and let your nakedness be exposed. The cup of punishment that Yahweh holds in his right hand is now coming around to you. Your former glory will be covered with your vomit of disgrace.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Your violent acts against Lebanon will violently overwhelm you. Since you killed its animals, animals will terrify you. For you have killed many people and acted violently against lands and cities and everyone in them.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“You are doomed, you who say to a piece of dead wood, ‘Come to life!’ Or to lifeless stone, ‘Get up!’ Can something dead give revelation? Even though it is covered with gold and silver, there is no breath in it. Of what use is an idol carved by a craftsman? Or a metal image that gives misleading oracles? For the one who makes it trusts the work of human hands; a god that cannot even talk.”</verse>

				<verse number="1">This is the passionate prayer of Habakkuk the prophet.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh, I know the things that have made you famous. I am stunned when I consider your miracles. Do them again in our day! Let this generation experience your mighty deeds. Yahweh, show us your mercy even in this time of turmoil.</verse>
				<verse number="3">God came from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. The heavens blazed with the brightness of his glory while the earth echoed his praises.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The brilliance of his glory is bright as the sun; twin bolts of lightning flash from his hand — there is the hiding place of his power.</verse>
				<verse number="5">A plague marched in front of him; a consuming pestilence followed at his heels.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When he stood up, the earth shook. At his glance, nations trembled, mountains crumbled, and age-old hills collapsed, but his paths are everlasting.</verse>
				<verse number="7">In my vision, I saw the tents of Cushan trembling in distress and the tent curtains of the Midianites shaking in anguish.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh, was it the rivers that made you angry or stirred up your rage? Was it the sea that made you furious when you rode your horses and chariots of salvation?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Your bow is strung and ready for action, and with a word, you commission your arrows to hit their mark. You carved open the earth with rivers.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The mountains saw you and trembled. Torrential rains flooded the earth; the ocean depths roared and lifted their waves on high.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Sun and moon stood still in the sky when your speeding arrows flashed and your glittering spear gleamed.</verse>
				<verse number="12">In your fury you marched across the earth, and in your anger you trampled the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You came to save your people, to win the victory with your Messiah. You crushed the head of the house of wickedness and stripped him from head to toe.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You pierced his head with his own arrows when his warriors stormed out to scatter us, gloating as they slaughtered their wretched victims in hiding.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You trampled the sea with your horses, churning the great waters.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I hear all this, and my heart pounds; my teeth chatter with fear at the sound. My body goes limp, and my legs tremble. Yet my heart quietly rests. I know the day of trouble is ahead for the people invading us.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Even if my fig trees do not blossom and my vines grow no grapes, if my olive crop fails and my fields produce no harvest, and even if all my sheep die and I’m left with no cattle in my barn,</verse>
				<verse number="18">I still have Yahweh, and I will rejoice in him. Yes, I will dance with joy no matter what, for I have a Savior-God!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yahweh is the Lord of my strength; he makes my feet sure-footed as a deer bounding upon the high places. These are the lyrics for the conductor of my string ensemble.</verse>

				<verse number="1">This is the prophetic message Yahweh gave to Zephaniah son of Cushi, grandson of Gedaliah, great-grandson of Amariah, great-great-grandson of Hezekiah. Zephaniah received this message during the time when Josiah, the son of Amon, ruled Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“I, Yahweh, declare that I will certainly sweep away every living thing from the land— animals and humans, birds and fish. I will topple the wicked and their idols and sweep away man from the land.”</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">“I will punish Judah and all who live in Jerusalem. I will wipe out every trace of Baal from the land along with the names of the pagan priests or any priest who has turned away from me.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I will punish those who bow down on their rooftops to worship the sun, moon, and stars and those with divided loyalties who bow before Yahweh and swear allegiance to me but also swear their oaths in the name of their king.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I, Yahweh, will punish those who have turned their back on me, who do not seek me nor pray for me to guide them.”</verse>

				<verse number="15">It will be a day of wrath, a day of terror and trouble, a day of desolation and distress, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,</verse>
				<verse number="16">a day of shofar blasts and battle shouts against fortified cities and all the lofty towers.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“I will bring such distress on people that they will grope their way like the blind for having sinned against me. Their blood will be poured out like dust, yes, their flesh like dung.</verse>
				<verse number="18">On that day, I will display my great anger, and none of their silver or gold will save them. My avenging zeal will burn like a fire on that day, to consume the entire land. For I will bring a terrible and sudden end that will destroy everyone living in the land.”</verse>

				<verse number="1">Go ahead and gather yourselves together, you shameless people! Gather yourselves together and turn back to Yahweh</verse>
				<verse number="2">before the appointed time arrives. Repent before you are blown away like chaff, which is swept away in a day, before Yahweh pours out on you his fiery anger— the day of Yahweh ’s burning fury.</verse>
				<verse number="3">All who are meek and humble on earth, seek the mercy of Yahweh. All who obey his commands, pursue righteousness and discover true humility. For maybe, just maybe, Yahweh will shelter you on the day of his anger.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“For Gaza will be deserted, and Ashkelon devastated. Ashdod will be driven out in broad daylight, and Ekron left desolate.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Doom to you who live on the seacoast, to the nation of Cherethites! And Canaan, land of the Philistines, the word of Yahweh is bad news for you. I will destroy and annihilate you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Your coastal lands will be reduced to pastureland, to grazing grounds for shepherds and folds for flocks.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Your land will be occupied by the remnant of the people of Judah. During the day, they will find pasture by the sea, and at night, they will rest in the houses of Ashkelon. Yahweh their God will care for them, and make them prosper again.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">“I, Yahweh, have heard the crude taunts of Moab and the vile insults of the Ammonites as they scorned my people and boasted that they would annex the land of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For as surely as I live, I, Yahweh, God of Israel, Commander of Angel Armies, decree: Moab will become like Sodom and the Ammonites like Gomorrah. The remnant of my people will plunder them; the survivors of my nation will possess them. Their lands will become barren forever, a land of nothing but salt pits and piles of weeds.</verse>
				<verse number="10">This will be the price of their pride, of having taunted and boasted against the people of Yahweh, who commands angel armies.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I, Yahweh, will be terrifying to them, for I will make all the gods of the earth vanish. And the people of every nation will bow down and worship me wherever they live.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">“You Ethiopians, too, will be killed by my sword.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“I will attack the northern land of Assyria and destroy it all. Nineveh will be left as desolate and dry as a desert.</verse>
				<verse number="14">It will be nothing more than a resting place for flocks and herds, along with all creatures of every kind. The vulture and owl will nest at night in its ruins. Owls will hoot from the windows, and crows will caw in the doorways— for all their once-fancy cedar woodwork will be exposed to the elements.</verse>
				<verse number="15">This is the once-proud city, living so happy and carefree and thinking to herself, ‘I am so amazing, and I have no rival!’ Yet look at her now! What has she become? Nothing but a pile of rubble and a lair for wild beasts. Everyone who passes by will hiss with scorn and shake their fists.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Doomed is the filthy and foul city— the city of oppression!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Her people do not listen to the voice of God and will not accept correction. They do not trust in Yahweh anymore and do not want a close relationship with their God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Her rulers are roaring lions, and her judges are ravenous wolves who hunt in the evening, too greedy to leave even a bone till the morning.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Her prophets are proud, reckless impostors. Her priests profane the holy place and openly break the Law.</verse>
				<verse number="5">In spite of all this, Yahweh the Righteous resides in Jerusalem, and all he does is just and true. Morning by morning, he brings justice to light, and day by day, he never fails. Yet the wicked are shameless.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“I have destroyed proud nations and toppled their high towers. I filled their streets with rubble so no one walks through them. Their cities have been demolished. Everyone is gone. Not one is left.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I thought, ‘Certainly, now you will revere me. Now you will yield to my correction.’ Then I would not need to punish them again and destroy their homes. But no, they were just as eager to do whatever was evil.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“So wait patiently for me,” declares Yahweh. “Wait for the day when I rise to seize the prey. For I have determined to gather the nations and assemble the kingdoms so that they will experience my fury and know how great my anger is. For the land will be consumed by the fire of my avenging zeal.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“For then I will change the impure speech of all the people to the pure speech of praise so that all may worship my name together and serve me shoulder to shoulder.</verse>
				<verse number="10">From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my worshipers from distant lands will bring me gifts.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">“When that day comes, you will never again be put to shame over your former acts of rebellion. For I will remove from your midst all who are arrogant and who boast in their self-importance. You will never again strut about in pride on my holy mountain.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But I will leave a remnant among you: a humble and lowly people who will find their hiding place in the beautiful name of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They will do no wrong and only speak the truth, nor will they use any form of deceit. They will be content like grazing sheep. They will rest, and no one will frighten them.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Go ahead, sing for joy, daughter of Zion. People of Israel, get excited and shout aloud. Rejoice, let blissful praise fill your heart, fair daughter of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yahweh has canceled out his judgments against you. He has turned your accuser away. Yahweh, your King, is here within you, Israel; you have nothing more to fear.</verse>
				<verse number="16">On that day, the message for Jerusalem will be: Zion, do not yield to fear. Don’t let your heart be discouraged.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yahweh, your God, is inside you. He is the Warrior-Savior who takes such delight in you that it will make him leap for joy and shout with great gladness. Yes, he will soothe you with his love. He will sing over you his song of praise.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“I will remove the sadness over your appointed feasts, and you will not be ashamed about them again.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Behold, at the right time, I will deal with those who mistreat you. I will rescue the weak and regather the scattered ones. I will turn their shame into praise when I restore their honor across the land.</verse>
				<verse number="20">On that day, I will be your guide to bring you home; at that time, I will gather you together. You can be sure of this: I will give you a good name, and you will be admired among all the peoples of the earth as I restore your fortunes before your own eyes. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">On the first day of the month of Elul during the second year Darius was emperor of Persia, the word of Yahweh was spoken through the prophet Haggai. He delivered this prophecy to the appointed governor of Judah, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and to the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“ Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says this: ‘These people procrastinate by saying that this is not the right time to finish rebuilding Yahweh ’s house.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Yahweh spoke the following message to the people using Haggai as his mouthpiece:</verse>
				<verse number="4">“ Really? Is this the right time for you to be living in your expensive houses while my house lies in ruins?</verse>
				<verse number="5">So now, I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, say to you: You had better be intentional about the path you choose.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You have planted much but harvested very little. You fill your plates, but you are never full. You drink but are still thirsty. You put on clothes but not enough to keep warm. You earn wages, but your money burns a hole in your pocket and quickly runs out.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, repeat: Be intentional about the path you take.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now, go up the mountain, cut some timber, and rebuild my house, and I will take pleasure in it and manifest my glory there. It is I, Yahweh, who say so.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“You hoped for abundant crops, but instead you gathered little. When you brought in your meager harvest, I caused it to spoil. It is I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, asking you, ‘Why?’ It is because my house lies in ruins while each of you runs to his own house.</verse>
				<verse number="10">That is why the sky has withheld the rain and the ground its crops.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I have called down drought on the land and hills—your grain, oil, and new wine. It has affected both people and animals and spoiled all your attempts to grow food.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest, and the entire remnant of the people obeyed the voice of Yahweh their God. They recognized that Yahweh their God had sent Haggai to them, so they obeyed his words. And the people were filled with holy awe toward Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then the messenger of Yahweh, Haggai, spoke Yahweh ’s promise to the people: “I am with you to bless you —declares Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">And Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah, the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest, and the spirit of the entire remnant of the people, and they came together to rebuild the temple of Yahweh, their God, the Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="15">They began their work on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">In the second year of King Darius, the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of Yahweh happened through the prophet Haggai as follows,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Go and give this urgent message to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and all the remnant of the people:</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Did anyone from among you see the magnificent glory of the original temple? And how does it look to you now? Does it not seem as nothing in your eyes?</verse>
				<verse number="4">“I, Yahweh say to you, Zerubbabel, be courageous! Joshua, son of Jehozadak, high priest, be courageous! All you living in the land, take heart! Go to work, for I am with you, says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I, Yahweh, will keep the covenant that I made with you when you came out of Egypt. My Spirit is still present among you, so be fearless.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“For I declare to you: Very soon, I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will once again shake the heavens and earth, the land and sea.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will shake every nation, and the treasures of the nations will flow in, and I will fill this temple with glory.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, declare to you, all the silver and gold is mine.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, declare to you, the glory of this new temple will surpass the glory of the original, and I will grant peace and prosperity in this place. “I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, have spoken.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">In the second year of Darius, on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, the word of Yahweh was spoken to the prophet Haggai as follows:</verse>
				<verse number="11">“I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, say to you: ‘Ask the priests for their ruling on this:</verse>
				<verse number="12">If someone holds consecrated meat from a sacrifice and carries it in the fold of his priestly robe, could his robe then pass on holiness if it comes into contact with bread, stew, wine, olive oil, or any kind of food at all?’ ” “No,” the priests replied.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Haggai then said, “If anyone is ritually unclean by contact with a corpse and touches any of these things, would it become unclean?” The priests replied, “Yes, it is unclean.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Haggai said, “So it is the same with this people. Yahweh declares: ‘The nation is unclean in my eyes. Everything they produce is unclean to me, and everything they offer at the altar is also unclean.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Now consider carefully your recent past before you started rebuilding Yahweh ’s temple.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Stop and remember what condition you were in. You would come expecting to scoop twenty measures of grain but find only ten. You would come expecting to draw fifty measures of wine from a vat but find only twenty.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I struck the produce of your labor by sending hail, hot desert winds to wither your grain, and damp winds to make it rot. Yet you still would not return to me —declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Today is the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, the day the people resumed the building of my temple. So be intentional from today forward.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The seed is still in the storehouse, isn’t it? Until now, the grapevines, fig trees, pomegranate and olive trees have not produced a harvest, but from now on, I will certainly bless you, and your harvest will be plentiful.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">On that same day, the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, the word of Yahweh happened a second time to Haggai, as follows:</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Tell these words to Zerubbabel governor of Judah: ‘I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I will topple thrones and destroy the dynasties of foreign kingdoms. I will crash their chariots and their riders. Horses and their riders will die, for their riders will kill one another with the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, declare, when that day comes, I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and make you like a signet ring. For I have chosen you to be mine. I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies have spoken.’ ”</verse>

		<book number="38">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">In October of the second year that Darius was emperor of Persia, Yahweh spoke to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“ I, Yahweh, was intensely angry with your ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So give the people this message: ‘ Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says to you: “Come back to me, and I will come back to you,” says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Do not be like your ancestors. Long ago my prophets warned them, saying, “Turn your lives around completely and end your evil, wicked ways.” But they refused to listen to me or obey me.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And where did they end up? And the prophets, did they live forever?</verse>
				<verse number="6">But my words and warnings, which I gave through my servants the prophets, proved to be true. Your ancestors ignored them, and so they were punished. As a result, they repented, saying, “ Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has punished us as he warned he would do and as our sinful ways have deserved.” ’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="7">On February 15 (the month of Shvat), in the second year of Darius’ reign, Yahweh spoke to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, son of Iddo.</verse>
				<verse number="8">That night I had a vision. Behold, I saw a man sitting on a reddish-brown horse in the shadows of a grove of myrtles. And behind him I saw other horses—some brown, tan, and white with riders upon them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">There was another angel there who talked with me, and I asked him, “What do these represent, my lord?” And the angel who was talking to me said, “Let me show you.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then the man standing among the myrtles spoke up and said, “These are Yahweh ’s agents sent to patrol the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then the horsemen reported to the angel of Yahweh who stood among the myrtles, “We have been patrolling the land, and indeed, all is peacefully at rest.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yahweh ’s angel then spoke and said, “ Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, you have inflicted your anger on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah for the past seventy years. How many more years will pass before you once again show them that you love them?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh then replied to the angel who was talking to me with kind and comforting words.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So the angel told me to proclaim these words of Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies: “My heart burns with passion for Jerusalem and Zion,</verse>
				<verse number="15">but I am deeply angry with the careless and complacent nations. I was only mildly angry with my people, but the nations I used to punish them acted too severely.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Therefore, I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy and kindness. I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, have decreed to rebuild my house there. Surveyors will stretch my measuring line over Jerusalem to rebuild the city.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">The angel also told me to proclaim, “I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, decree that my cities will once more overflow with prosperity. I will comfort Zion once again and claim Jerusalem as my own.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then I looked up and had a vision. Behold, I saw four horns.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I asked the angel who was talking to me, “What do these represent?” And he answered, “These are the four horns that scattered Jerusalem, Judah, and Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then Yahweh opened my eyes to see four conquering craftsmen.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And I asked, “What are they coming to do?” He replied, “They have come to terrify and hammer out justice among the nations who lifted their horns to completely crush the land of Judah and scatter its inhabitants.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Then I looked up again and had another vision. Behold, I saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I asked him, “Where are you going with that?” “To measure Jerusalem,” he replied, “to calculate her width and length.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">And behold, the angel who was talking with me left, and another angel came out to meet him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He said to him, “Run, and tell the surveyor to stop measuring, for Jerusalem will be too full of people and animals to measure or be enclosed by walls.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So, I, Yahweh, will be a protective wall of fire surrounding her and a radiant glory within her.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Look out! Look out! Flee from Babylon,” declares Yahweh, “for like the four winds of heaven I have scattered you in every direction,” declares Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Escape, Zion, you who live within the fair city of Babylon!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">For Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, sent me after glory. And he warns the nations who plundered you: “Whoever touches you, my precious ones, touches the apple of my eye.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now behold, I will raise my fist against them to crush them, and those whom they enslaved will plunder them. Then you will know that Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has sent me.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">I, Yahweh, declare to you: “It’s time to sing out and rejoice, my daughter Zion, for now I am coming to live among you.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">At that time, people from many nations will be converted to Yahweh and become his people, and he will live among them. Then you will know that Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has sent me to you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The people of Judah will become Yahweh ’s special people, his inheritance in the holy land, and he will again choose Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Let everyone be silent before Yahweh, for now he is stirring from his holy dwelling place.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Then I was shown another vision. I saw Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh dressed in filthy clothes. On Joshua’s right was the accuser, standing there ready to prosecute him. The angel of Yahweh said to Satan, “ Yahweh rebukes you, Satan! Yes, Yahweh rebukes you, for he has chosen Jerusalem. And he has rescued Joshua, like a stick snatched out of the fire.”</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">Then the angel said to those heavenly council members who were standing before him, “Remove Joshua’s filthy clothes.” Then he said to Joshua, “Behold, I have taken your guilt away, and I will clothe you with splendid robes.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">And I spoke up and requested, “Let them also put a clean turban on his head.” So they dressed him in clean clothes and put on his head a clean turban while the angel of Yahweh stood nearby.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So the angel of Yahweh solemnly assured Joshua with these words:</verse>
				<verse number="7">“ Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, declares to you, ‘If you walk in my ways and live in obedience to me, you will preside over my temple and keep watch over my courts. And I will let you come and go in the same way as your fellow council members standing here.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">“ ‘So listen, high priest Joshua, you and your fellow priests seated here are beautiful symbols of what is to come. Behold, I will reveal my servant, the Branch!</verse>
				<verse number="9">And behold, I have laid a stone before Joshua, a precious, unique stone with seven eyes. And I will engrave a special inscription on it,’ says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. “ ‘And in a single day, I will remove the sin of the people of this land.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And at that time, everyone will invite his friends to come and have fellowship under their own vine and their own fig tree. I, Yahweh, have spoken.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Then the angel who had been explaining the visions came back and roused me as someone awakened from sleep.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And he asked me, “What do you see?” As I focused my eyes, I replied, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl for the oil on top. It has seven lamps, and each lamp has a golden spout for the wicks.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And I also see two olive trees overshadowing the lampstand, one on the right and one on the left.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So I asked the angel who was talking to me, “My lord, what do these things represent?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The angel answered, “Do you not know what they are?” “No, my lord,” I said.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Here is the message of Yahweh to Zerubbabel: “ You will not succeed by military might nor by your own strength but by my Spirit,” says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“And what are you, O mighty mountain? Before you, Zerubbabel, this mountain of obstacles will crumble. Then he will set the capstone in place to shouts of ‘Grace and beauty be upon it!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then another message from Yahweh came to me:</verse>
				<verse number="9">“With his own hands, Zerubbabel has laid the foundation of this temple, and with his own hands he will finish it. Then you will know that Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has sent me to you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Those who despise the day of small beginnings will rejoice when they see Zerubbabel holding the plumb line in his hands. “The seven lamps represent the seven eyes of Yahweh that keep a close watch over everything on earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then I asked the angel two questions: “What about these two olive trees on each side of the lampstand?</verse>
				<verse number="12">And what are the two branches from which golden oil flows through the two golden pipes?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">He replied, “Don’t you know what these are?” “No, my lord,” I answered.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So he explained, “These branches are the two sons of oil who serve the Lord of all the earth.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Then I had another vision. I looked up and saw a flying scroll.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The angel asked me, “What do you see?” I replied, “I see a flying scroll. It looks about thirty-five feet long and seventeen feet wide.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then he explained to me its meaning: “This scroll contains God’s curse against evildoers sweeping over the whole land. On one side of the scroll, it says that the Lord will banish every thief. On the other side, it says that he will banish everyone who lies using his name.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, declares, ‘I will release this curse, and it will enter the house of the thief and of anyone who lies using my name. The curse will remain in his house until it consumes it—walls, beams, and all.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the angel who was talking to me appeared and said, “Look at what is coming.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">I asked, “What is it?” He replied, “It is a barrel, and it is carrying the guilt of all the people of the land of Judah.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">As I looked, the angel removed the heavy lid made of lead from the barrel, and a woman was seated inside.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The angel said, “This is Lady Wickedness.” And he shoved her back into the barrel and clamped the lead lid over her.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I looked up and suddenly two women appeared, soaring swiftly in the sky with outstretched wings like those of a stork. They lifted the barrel high in the sky and flew away with it.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So I asked the angel who was talking to me, “Where are they taking the barrel?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">He replied, “To the wicked land of Babylon, where they will build a temple and make a pedestal for it. They will place it there and worship it.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Then I looked once more and had another vision. I saw four chariots coming out between two mountains of bronze.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The first chariot was pulled by reddish-brown horses, the second by black horses,</verse>
				<verse number="3">the third by white horses, and the fourth by dappled horses—all of them mighty.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I asked the angel who was talking to me, “What do these represent, my lord?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The angel explained, “These are the four winds of heaven. They are being dispatched after standing before the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The black horses are leaving for the land of the north, the white ones for the west, and the dappled for the land of the south.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">The strong horses came out eager to patrol the world. He said, “Go and patrol the earth,” and off they went.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then he called to me and said, “Watch, the ones going to the land of the north are going to make my Spirit descend upon that region.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then another message from Yahweh came to me:</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Go at once to the home of Josiah the son of Zephaniah. There you will receive gifts from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have just arrived among the exiles in Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Accept their gifts of gold and silver and make a crown to place on the head of the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And say this to him, ‘This is what Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says: “Behold the man whose name is the Branch! He will branch out and flourish from his place, and he will build Yahweh ’s sanctuary.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yes, he will build Yahweh ’s sanctuary and will be clothed with majesty. He will sit on his throne and rule. He will be a priest ruling on his throne. These two offices will flow together with perfect harmony.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Joshua’s crown will be placed in my temple as a memorial to the donors Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and in recognition of the generosity of Josiah the son of Zephaniah.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And those in distant lands will come to assist the building of Yahweh ’s sanctuary.” “ ‘When this happens, you will know for certain that Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, has sent me to you. This will happen if you faithfully obey the voice of Yahweh your God.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">In the fourth year of Emperor Darius, on the seventh of December, Yahweh spoke again to Zechariah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melech with a delegation to Jerusalem to pray for the favor of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So they went to the prophets and priests who were at the Temple of Yahweh and asked them: “For many years, each July we have mourned and fasted. Should we continue to do this?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Yahweh spoke this message to me:</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Ask all the priests and the people of the land: ‘For nearly seventy years, you have been fasting and mourning in the fifth and seventh months. Have you truly been doing this to honor me?</verse>
				<verse number="6">And when you ate and drank, were you not doing it for your own pleasure?</verse>
				<verse number="7">Did not Yahweh speak these things to you through the prophets in the past? Have you forgotten what he told you when Jerusalem and the surrounding towns were prosperous and secure and when the southland and western foothills were inhabited?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh spoke again to Zechariah, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Here is the message of Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies: “Apply the law fairly. “Demonstrate tender love and compassion toward all.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Never oppress the widow and the fatherless, the foreigner and the poor. “And do not secretly plot to harm someone.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">But they would not listen; they turned their backs on him, and they stopped up their ears rather than stopping to hear.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Their hearts became as hard as a rock. They refused to listen to the teaching of Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. And they would not hear the words he spoke by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, became very angry.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says, “Even when I called for them, they would not listen. Therefore, I would not listen when they prayed to me for help.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Like a whirlwind, I swept them away to live in distant lands as foreigners.” After they were scattered, the country was left so desolate that it became impassable. What once was a land of delights they turned into a desert of desolation.</verse>

			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, spoke to me, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, say to you: My heart burns with passion for Zion, and my jealousy for her makes me red-hot with anger toward her enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="3">“I, Yahweh, have this to say: I will return to Jerusalem and live there on Mount Zion. Then Jerusalem will be known as my faithful city and Zion as my holy mountain, the mountain of Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, say to you: Men and women will once again sit in the parks and squares of Jerusalem, each with a staff to lean on because of their great age.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And the parks and squares of the city will bustle with boys and girls playing outside.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, have this to say: If this seems too marvelous for the remnant of my people to believe today, remember this—is there anything too marvelous for me? For I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Here is what I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, say to you: Behold, I will rescue my people from the countries of the east and the west.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I will bring them back to live in the heart of Jerusalem, and they will be my beloved people, and I will be their faithful God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“This is what I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, have to say: Be encouraged, you who now hear these words spoken by the prophets who were there when the foundation was laid for the house of Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. May your hearts be brave so that the temple may be built.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For up till now, there was no money to hire men or animals; neither has there been security for people to come and go because I had turned them against each other.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But now, I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will not treat the remnant of this people as I have in the past.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For now they will plant in peace. Fresh dew will fall from the sky, and the soil will be fertile. Their vineyards will be lush and fruitful. I will grant the remnant of my people all these things.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Judah and Jerusalem, your names have been used as curses among all the nations, but now you will become the symbol of a blessing. Yes, I will save you to be a blessing, so do not be afraid. Let your hearts be brave!</verse>
				<verse number="14">“For I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, say to you: Just as I determined to bring calamity when your ancestors made me angry and I showed no pity,</verse>
				<verse number="15">so now I have determined to treat Judah and Jerusalem well and make them prosperous. So do not be afraid!</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Here is what you must do: Speak the truth to one another. Pursue justice in your courts, and hand down verdicts that are sound.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Have no evil scheme in your hearts against one another. Do not take delight in committing perjury, for these are things that I hate, declares Yahweh.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, spoke these words to me:</verse>
				<verse number="19">“I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, say this to you: Instead of having days of fasting in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months, the people of Judah are to have cheerful, joy-filled festivals. Simply live together peacefully and love truth.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says this, “In the future, people from many nations and cities will come streaming to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Citizens of one city will say to the people of another city: ‘We must certainly go and worship Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, and seek his blessing. I am determined to go.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Yes, many peoples and many nations will worship Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, in Jerusalem and seek his blessing.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, says this, “In that day, there will be ten men who take hold of the robe of a Jew. They will come from all nations, speaking every language, and will say: ‘We have heard that God is with you! We want to go with you.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">A prophecy: The weighty message of Yahweh pertains to the region of Hadrach, and it will come to rest upon Damascus. “ Yahweh keeps an eye on every person and on all the tribes of Israel</verse>
				<verse number="2">and even on Hamath, which borders Damascus, and on Tyre and Sidon with all their great wisdom.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The people of Tyre have built for themselves a fortress. They have swept up piles of silver like dust and gathered mounds of gold like the dirt of the streets.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Behold! The Lord will take away all she has, burn her city to the ground, and sink her warships into the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Ashkelon will see it and be afraid; Gaza will see it and writhe in agony. Ekron will witness the loss of her hopes; the king of Gaza will perish, and Ashkelon will be deserted.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Foreigners will live in Ashdod. Yes, I will destroy the pride of the Philistine people.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will stop them from eating meat with its blood and take the forbidden food from between their teeth. But their remnant, too, will become a part of the people of God, like a clan in Judah. And the people of Ekron will also become a part of God’s people as did the Jebusites.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I will stand guard before my temple to defend it from all who march against it. No oppressor will overrun them ever again, for now, I am constantly on the alert.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“My daughter Zion, let your heart and soul rejoice! Rejoice, my daughter Jerusalem, and shout your cheerful praises! Look! Your King comes to you. He is righteous and fully qualified to save you. Yet he comes to you so humbly, riding on a donkey; sitting meekly on a colt, a young foal of a donkey.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I, the Lord, will banish war chariots and horses from Israel and Jerusalem. I will break the bows used in war. Your king will proclaim peace and well-being to the nations. His dominion will stretch from sea to sea, from the river to the ends of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As for you, Zion, because of my covenant with you sealed with blood, I have set your captives free from the waterless pit of their prison.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Come running back home to your fortress, you hope-filled prisoners! This very day, I vow I will restore to you double blessing for your trouble.</verse>
				<verse number="13">My people will be my weapons, for I have bent Judah as my bow and made Ephraim my arrow. I will awaken and stir up your sons, Zion, against the sons of Greece. I will use you like a warrior’s sword.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Yahweh will appear above them, and his arrow will flash like lightning. The Lord Yahweh will sound the shofar and advance in the great storm of his power.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will be their shield. Their slinging stones shall conquer and subdue the enemy, spilling their blood like wine from an overfilled bowl, like the blood that stains the corners of the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="16">On that day, Yahweh their God will rescue them and make a way. For they are like a beloved flock of sheep to him, yes, precious like the gemstones of a diadem that will sparkle throughout his land.</verse>
				<verse number="17">How beautiful and splendid they will be! Young men will flourish by eating the grain, and the maidens by drinking the new wine.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Ask Yahweh for rain in the season of the latter rain. For Yahweh is the Thunderstorm-Maker. He will give them the outpouring of rain, causing the grain of the field to flourish.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The household gods babble nonsense, the fortune tellers see false visions, dreamers peddle delusions and give comfort in vain. Therefore, the people have strayed like scattered, suffering, lost sheep because they have no shepherd.</verse>
				<verse number="3">“I am enraged at the so-called shepherds, and I will vent my anger and punish the proud leaders. I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, care deeply for my flock, the people of Judah. I will transform them from a shepherdless flock of sheep into brave battle horses of splendor.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Out of them will emerge the cornerstone and the tent peg. From them will emerge battle bows and warrior captains. Together</verse>
				<verse number="5">they will be like warriors trampling the foe in battle like mud in the streets. They will fight because Yahweh fights with them; they will defeat and humiliate the horsemen.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“I will make the people of Judah mighty and the descendants of Joseph victorious. And I will bring them back home because I have compassion on them. They will be as though I had never rejected them, for I am Yahweh their God, and I will answer their prayers.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The people of Israel will be like warriors. Their hearts will be cheered as though by wine. Their children will see this and be full of joy, and their hearts will celebrate and rejoice in Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“I will whistle to call them home as a shepherd gathers his sheep, for I have redeemed them. And they will be as numerous as ever before.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Though I sowed my people as seed among the nations, they will remember me in those faraway lands. They will all return and rear their children.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For I will bring them home from Egypt and gather them back from Assyria; I will lead them back into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, yet even there they will not have enough space.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“I will cross the turbulent sea of trouble and calm its waves. All the depths of the Nile will dry up. I will humble arrogant Assyria and dismantle the power of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will make my people mighty in me, and they will walk in my name. I, Yahweh, declare it.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Open your borders, Lebanon. Let fire consume your cedar trees.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Cry in sorrow, cypress, for the towering cedar trees have toppled— the high and mighty ones are destroyed. Wail, oaks of Bashan, for the thick forest has been felled.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Listen! It’s the sound of the wailing of shepherds. Their glory is gone, their rich pastures destroyed. Listen! It’s the sound of the young lions roaring. The thickets of the Jordan have been ravaged.</verse>
				<verse number="4">This is what my God, Yahweh, says: “Shepherd the inhabitants of this land, for they are like a flock doomed for slaughter.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Those who buy them slaughter them without remorse. And the merchants who sell them say, ‘Blessed be Yahweh, I have become rich!’ Even the hirelings—their own shepherds—show no pity for the sheep. I will no longer show mercy to the inhabitants of the land,” declares Yahweh. “Instead, I will cause each one to fall into the clutches of his neighbor and into the clutches of his king. They will devastate the land, and I will not rescue anyone from their power.”</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">So I became a shepherd for the sheep doomed for slaughter, especially for those sheep who had been trafficked. I took two staffs in my hand; one I named “Affection,” and the other I named “Union,” and I cared for the sheep myself.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So I removed three shepherds in one month, for I ran out of patience with the sheep-traffickers, and they hated me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And I told them, “I am not going to be your shepherd anymore. Those doomed to die can die; those doomed for destruction can perish; and the rest can devour one another.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then I took my staff, “Affection,” and broke it in half to revoke the covenant that I had made with the whole nation of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So it was annulled on that day, and the sheep-traffickers, who were watching me, realized that Yahweh was speaking through me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then I said to them, “If it seems right to you, give me my wages; if not, never mind.” So they weighed out my wages: thirty shekels of silver.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh said to me, “Now, hand your silver over to the treasury, these thirty pieces of silver—this wonderful sum at which they valued me.” So I took the thirty shekels of silver and handed them over to the treasury in the house of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then I broke in half my second staff, “Union,” to symbolize the breaking of brotherly bonds between Judah and Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Next, Yahweh said to me, “Once again, act the part of a worthless shepherd and take with you the shepherd’s gear.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For behold, I am now raising up a shepherd in the land who will not care about the lost, who will not go in search of the stray, who will not heal the injured, who will not feed the healthy sheep, but instead, he will eat the meat of the fattest sheep and even tear off their hooves.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Doom is ahead for the worthless shepherd who deserts his flock! May the sword strike his arm and gouge his right eye! May his arm shrivel completely and his right eye be totally blind!”</verse>

			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">A prophecy. A message of Yahweh to Israel. “I, Yahweh, the Heaven-Unfolder, the Earth-Foundation-Layer, and the Spirit-Shaper of every human spirit, announce to you:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Behold! I am about to make Jerusalem an intoxicating cup filled with the wine of my wrath. Any nation around her who dares to drink from it will stagger and fall. And a siege will be laid against Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="3">“In that day, when all the nations join forces against her, I will make Jerusalem like a heavy stone. All who lift it will severely injure themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“In that day, I will confuse every horse with panic and their riders with madness,” says Yahweh. “ Yes, I will strike the horses of the enemies with blindness, but I will watch over the people of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the leaders of Judah will say to themselves, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong because Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, is their God.’</verse>
				<verse number="6">“In that day, I will make Judah’s leaders like a blazing pot in a pile of dry brush, like a flaming torch in straw. They will destroy in all directions the surrounding nations. The people of Jerusalem will continue to live safely in their own city.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I, Yahweh, will save the tents of Judah first so that the descendants of David and the people of Jerusalem do not receive more honor than the rest of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“In that day, my wraparound presence will protect the people of Jerusalem. And in that day I will transform the weakest among them to become as mighty as David, and the dynasty of David will be like God, like the angel of Yahweh going before them.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“I am determined in that day to destroy all the nations who attack Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But I will pour out over the rulers and people of Jerusalem the Spirit of Grace and the Spirit of Prayer. And they will gaze upon me, the Pierced One. They will mourn for the one they pierced as though for an only child and weep bitterly for him as people weep for a firstborn child.</verse>
				<verse number="11">In that day, the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad Rimmon in the Plain of Megiddo.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And the people of the land will mourn each clan by itself and their women by themselves: The clan of David’s family and their women, the clan of Nathan’s family and their women,</verse>
				<verse number="13">the clan of Levi’s family and their women, the clan of Shimei’s family and their women,</verse>
				<verse number="14">and all the rest of the clans and their women.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">“In that day, I will tear open a flowing fountain for the family of David and the people of Jerusalem—a fountain to wash away sin and impurity.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">“I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, declare: In that day, I will eliminate idolatry from the land, and no one will remember the names of idols anymore. I will also rid the land of false prophets and unclean spirits.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Therefore, if anyone continues prophesying falsely, his parents who gave him life will say to him, ‘You must forfeit your life since you speak lies in Yahweh ’s name.’ And even while he is prophesying, his parents who gave him life will pierce him through.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“In that day, every false prophet will be ashamed to prophesy and share their so-called visions. No longer will false prophets wear the coarse robe to deceive people into thinking they are genuine prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Instead, they will admit, ‘I am not a prophet. I have been living off the land as a farmer ever since my youth.’</verse>
				<verse number="6">And if anyone asks him, ‘What are those scars on your back?’ he will reply, ‘I was wounded in the house of my dear friends.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Awake my sword! Strike my shepherd! Strike the man who stands close to me,” declares Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. “If you strike the shepherd, the sheep will scatter. I will even set myself against the young ones.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“So it will be, throughout the land,” declares Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. “Two-thirds of the people will be struck down, and the other third will remain.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I will cause the remaining third to pass through the fire, to refine them as silver is refined. And I will test them as gold is tested. They will call on my name, and I will answer them; I will say to them, ‘You are my people,’ and they will say, ‘ Yahweh is our God!’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">Behold, Yahweh, will have his day! And Jerusalem, when that day comes, your plunder will be divided in your midst.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem for battle. The city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the women raped. Half the people will go into exile, but the rest will be allowed to remain in the city.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Yahweh will intervene and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle.</verse>
				<verse number="4">On that day, his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem. Then the Mount of Olives will be divided down the middle, forming a wide valley that runs from east to west. So half the Mount will move backward to the north and the other half to the south.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When this happens, you will escape by way of my newly formed valley, which will extend as far as Azal. You will flee as your ancestors fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And Yahweh your God will come and all the holy ones with him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">On that day, there will be no light, neither cold nor frost.</verse>
				<verse number="7">It will be a unique day, a day known only to Yahweh. There will be no more day and night, and even at evening, it will remain light.</verse>
				<verse number="8">On that day, living waters will flow from Jerusalem, half toward the Dead Sea, half toward the Mediterranean Sea. And they will flow in the summer and winter.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then King Yahweh will rule over the whole world. When that day comes, Yahweh will be the one and only God, and everyone will acknowledge him by one single name.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The entire land of Judah will be transformed into a fertile plain, from Geba in the north to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem will remain standing high above the plain from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the first gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses.</verse>
				<verse number="11">People will live there securely, for the city will never again be doomed to destruction. Jerusalem will be safe to live in.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And Yahweh will bring a devastating plague upon all the nations who have fought against Jerusalem. Their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet. Their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And on that day, Yahweh will cause their hearts to panic. Each one will seize his neighbor and strike him. Fighting will break out one against another</verse>
				<verse number="14">until even the people of Judah will fight against the people of Jerusalem. The people of Jerusalem will gather all the riches of the surrounding nations: vast amounts of gold, silver, and clothing.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And a similar plague will afflict the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the other animals in the camp of their enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Afterward, the survivors of all the nations that have attacked the city will return to Jerusalem each year to worship the King of the world, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And if any of the people groups of the world do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King of the world, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, no rain will fall upon their land.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And if the Egyptian people do not make this pilgrimage, then Yahweh will send the same plague he sent the other nations that did not celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.</verse>
				<verse number="19">This will be the punishment for Egypt and the punishment for all the nations that fail to come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When that day comes, the very bells on the horses will have inscribed on them, “Holy to Yahweh.” Even the cooking pots of the house of Yahweh will be as sacred as the sprinkling bowls set before the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yes, every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, and acceptable to use for anyone who comes to offer a sacrifice. And at that time there will be no merchant in the house of Yahweh, who commands the armies of heaven.</verse>

				<verse number="2">“I, Yahweh, say to you: I have always loved you. “But you ask, ‘How have you shown us your love?’ “I, Yahweh, say to you: Were not Esau and Jacob twins? Yet I have loved Jacob and his descendants</verse>
				<verse number="3">more than Esau and his descendants, whom I rejected. And I have turned the hill country of Esau into a barren wasteland and left his land to the desert jackals.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“The people of Edom vow, ‘Though we have been shattered, we will rebuild the ruins.’ “But this is what I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, say: You may build, but I will demolish it again. People will call you ‘The Wicked Land’ and ‘The People under the Perpetual Anger of Yahweh.’</verse>
				<verse number="5">“ Israel, you will witness this with your own eyes and say, ‘The greatness of Yahweh extends even beyond our own borders.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">“I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, say to you priests, ‘Sons honor their fathers, and servants respect their masters. Yet if I am your father, why don’t you honor me? If I am your master, why don’t you respect me? You have despised my glorious name.’ “But you ask, ‘How have we despised your name?’</verse>
				<verse number="7">“You place defiled food on my sacred altar. “Still you ask, ‘How have we defiled you?’ “By treating Yahweh ’s table as though it deserves no respect.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Is it not wrong to offer your blind, lame, and sick animals as sacrifices to me? Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he show you favor?” asks Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Now try flattering me with inappropriate sacrifices that I may be gracious to you. When you offer me such sacrifices, do you expect me to show you favor?” asks Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“It would be far better to halt temple worship altogether and one of you shut the temple gates so that you would not keep lighting worthless fires on my altar. I am not pleased with you, and I will not accept any offering from your hands,” says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“From one end of the world to the other, my name will be great among the nations. In every place, incense and a pure offering will be offered to my name. All over the world my name will receive honor,” says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>

				<verse number="13">You also say, ‘We’re fed up with all this!’ And you turn up your nose in disgust,” says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. “You offer me injured, crippled, or diseased animals, but I won’t accept your sacrifices. This is Yahweh speaking to you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“A curse rests on the cheat who has a perfect male offering in his flock and vows to give it but then sacrifices a puny, imperfect animal to me. For I am a great King,” says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, “and my name is to be formidable among the nations.”</verse>

Yes, I have already done so since you have not dedicated your heart to honor me.</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Behold! I will rebuke your descendants. I will smear feces on your faces—the dung from your festival sacrifices—and you priests will be tossed away with the animal waste.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And then you will know that I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, have sent you this commandment so that my covenant with Levi may endure.</verse>
				<verse number="5">My covenant with his tribe was a covenant to give them a full, peaceful life. All this I gave to him so that he would revere me, and indeed, he honored me and stood in awe of my name.</verse>

				<verse number="7">“Listen, you priests, descendants of Levi. Your lips should be a gateway to sacred truths when people come to you for instruction because you are the messengers of Yahweh, who rules over all.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But you have turned from my path, and your teachings have caused many to stumble. You have corrupted the covenant with Levi. So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people. For you have not followed my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law. This is Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, speaking to you.”</verse>

				<verse number="10">Have we not all one Father, the one God who created us? So why do we cheat one another and violate the covenant that God made with our ancestors?</verse>
				<verse number="11">The people of Judah have been unfaithful. A horrible atrocity has been committed throughout the land and even in Jerusalem. They have married foreign women who worship their strange gods and in this way have defiled Yahweh ’s temple, which he loves.</verse>
				<verse number="12">May Yahweh punish the one who has done such a despicable thing, whoever he may be, even though he brings offerings to the Lord Almighty. May Yahweh banish his entire family from the community of Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Another thing you do: You drown Yahweh ’s altar with tears. You weep and wail because he no longer values your offerings or accepts with pleasure what you bring him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Why not?” you ask. It is because you promised before Yahweh to be faithful to the wife you chose in your youth. She is your partner, and you are bound to her by covenant, yet you have betrayed her.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Has God not made them one with a shared Spirit in their union? And what does he desire but godly children from your union? So guard your spirit and do not be disloyal to the wife of your youth.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“I, Yahweh, the God of Israel, say to you: ‘He who does not love his wife but hates her and divorces her overwhelms her with cruelty. So guard your spirit and do not abandon her.’ This is Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, speaking to you.”</verse>

				<verse number="1">“Behold! I am sending my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly, the Lord whom you long for will enter his temple. The messenger of the covenant, your soul’s delight, will certainly come,” says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>

				<verse number="3">He will be as a silversmith who sits refining and purifying silver. He will purify the Levites, refining his priests until they are like pure gold and fine silver. Then I, Yahweh, will have those who bring me offerings in righteousness.</verse>

				<verse number="5">“So I will come near to you and put you on trial.

This is Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, speaking to you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Truly, I, Yahweh, have not changed. And you, children of Jacob, you haven’t changed either.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Ever since the time of your ancestors, you have turned away from my laws and evaded them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. “But you ask, ‘How do we need to return?’</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Is it right for people to rob God? Yet you rob me. “But you ask, ‘How could we possibly rob you?’ “You withhold your tithes and offerings.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You are under a curse—the whole lot of you are guilty of robbing me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Bring the full amount of your tithes into the temple treasury so that there may be ample provisions in my house. Test me and see if I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, will fling open the floodgates of heaven for you and pour down upon you an overflowing blessing that you will not be able to contain.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I will defeat the devourer so that it will not destroy the fruits of your fields, and your vines will be full of grapes,” says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Then all the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land in which God takes delight. I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, promise you this.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Your harsh, rebellious words are in defiance of me,” says Yahweh. “But you ask, ‘What words are you talking about?’</verse>
				<verse number="14">“You have said, ‘It’s no use serving God. What do we gain by keeping his requirements and observing these mourning ceremonies before Yahweh?</verse>
				<verse number="15">But now, we will call proud people blessed. Even evildoers prosper, and those who provoke God escape punishment.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then those who lived in awe of Yahweh began discussing these things, and Yahweh noticed and listened. A scroll of remembrance was written in the presence of Yahweh. It included the names of those who lived in awe of Yahweh and honored his name.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“They will be mine,” says Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies. “And on the day when I make up my treasured possession, I will show them mercy, just as a compassionate father is gentle with his faithful son.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And you will once again see that I make a distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve me and those who do not.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">“You see, there is a day coming, raging like a fiery furnace. On that day, all the proud and wicked people will burn up like straw thrown into a furnace. Neither stalks nor roots will remain. I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, declare it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“But for you who stand in awe at the sound of my name, a new dawn is coming. For the sun of righteousness will rise with healing radiating from its wings. And you will be free and leap for joy like calves released from the stall.</verse>
				<verse number="3">In the day that I, Yahweh, Commander of Angel Armies, am preparing, you will overcome and trample down the wicked like they were ashes under your feet.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Remember the law of my servant Moses, the commands and instructions I gave him at Mount Sinai for all Israel to obey.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Keep watching, for I am sending you the prophet Elijah before that great and fearful day of Yahweh arrives.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He will return the fathers’ hearts to their children and the children’s hearts to their fathers so that I can come and bless and not strike the land with a curse.”</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">This is the scroll of the genealogy of Jesus, the Anointed One, the son of David and descendant of Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Abraham had a son named Isaac, who had a son named Jacob, who had a son named Judah (he and his brothers became the tribes of Israel).</verse>
				<verse number="3">Judah and Tamar had twin sons, Perez and Zerah. Perez had a son named Hezron, who had a son named Ram,</verse>
				<verse number="4">who had a son named Amminadab, who had a son named Nashon,</verse>
				<verse number="5">who had a son named Salmon, who, along with Rahab, had a son named Boaz. Boaz and Ruth had a son named Obed, who was the father of Jesse,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and Jesse had a son named David, who became the king.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then David and Bathsheba had a son named Solomon, who had a son named Rehoboam, who had a son named Abijah, who had a son named Asa,</verse>
				<verse number="8">who had a son named Jehoshaphat, who had a son named Joram, who had a son named Uzziah,</verse>
				<verse number="9">who had a son named Jotham, who had a son named Ahaz, who had a son named Hezekiah,</verse>
				<verse number="10">who had a son named Manasseh, who had a son named Amos, who had a son named Josiah,</verse>
				<verse number="11">who was the father of Jeconiah. It was during the days of Jeconiah and his brothers that Israel was taken captive and deported to Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="12">About the time of their captivity in Babylon, Jeconiah had a son named Shealtiel, who had a son named Zerubbabel,</verse>
				<verse number="13">who had a son named Abiud, who had a son named Eliakim,</verse>
				<verse number="14">who had a son named Azor, who had a son named Zadok, who had a son named Achim, who had a son named Eliud,</verse>
				<verse number="15">who had a son named Eleazar, who had a son named Matthan, who had a son named Jacob,</verse>
				<verse number="16">who was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary the mother of Jesus, who is called “the Anointed One.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">So from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian captivity, fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian captivity to Christ, fourteen generations.</verse>
				<verse number="18">This is how the birth of Jesus Christ took place. His mother, Mary, had promised Joseph to be his wife, but while she was still a virgin she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Her fiancé, Joseph, was a righteous man full of integrity and he didn’t want to disgrace her, but when he learned of her pregnancy he secretly planned to break the engagement.</verse>
				<verse number="20">While he was still debating with himself about what to do, he fell asleep and had a supernatural dream. An angel from the Lord appeared to him and said, “Joseph, descendant of David, don’t hesitate to take Mary into your home as your wife, because the power of the Holy Spirit has conceived a child in her womb.</verse>
				<verse number="21">She will give birth to a son and you are to name him ‘Savior,’ for he is destined to give his life to save his people from their sins.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">This happened to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through his prophet:</verse>
				<verse number="23">Listen! A virgin will be pregnant, she will give birth to a Son, and he will be known as “Emmanuel,” which means in Hebrew, “God became one of us.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">When Joseph woke from his dream, he did all that the angel of the Lord instructed him to do. He took Mary to be his wife,</verse>
				<verse number="25">but they refrained from having sex until she gave birth to her firstborn son, whom they named “Jesus.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem during the reign of King Herod. After Jesus’ birth a group of spiritual priests from the East came to Jerusalem</verse>
				<verse number="2">and inquired of the people, “Where is the child who is born king of the Jewish people? We observed his star rising in the sky and we’ve come to bow before him in worship.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">King Herod was shaken to the core when he heard this, and not only he, but all of Jerusalem was disturbed when they heard this news.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So he called a meeting of the Jewish ruling priests and religious scholars, demanding that they tell him where the promised Messiah was prophesied to be born.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“He will be born in Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,” they told him. “Because the prophecy states:</verse>
				<verse number="6">And you, little Bethlehem, are not insignificant among the clans of Judah, for out of you will emerge the Shepherd-King of my people Israel!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then Herod secretly summoned the spiritual priests from the East to ascertain the exact time the star first appeared.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And he told them, “Now go to Bethlehem and carefully look there for the child, and when you’ve found him, report to me so that I can go and bow down and worship him too.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">And on their way to Bethlehem, the same star they had seen in the East suddenly reappeared! Amazed, they watched as it went ahead of them and stopped directly over the place where the child was.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And when they saw the star, they were so ecstatic that they shouted and celebrated with unrestrained joy.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, they fell to the ground at his feet and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests full of gifts and presented him with gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Afterward they returned to their own country by another route because God had warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod.</verse>
				<verse number="13">After they had gone, Joseph had another dream. An angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, “Get up now and flee to Egypt. Take Mary and the little child and stay there until I tell you to leave, for Herod intends to search for the child to kill him.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">So that very night he got up and took Jesus and his mother and made their escape to Egypt</verse>
				<verse number="15">and remained there until Herod died. All of this fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through his prophet: I summon my Son out of Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When Herod realized that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was infuriated. So he sent soldiers with orders to slaughter every baby boy two years old and younger in Bethlehem and throughout the surrounding countryside, based on the time frame he was given from interrogating the wise men.</verse>
				<verse number="17">This fulfilled the words of the prophet Jeremiah:</verse>
				<verse number="18">I hear the screams of anguish, weeping, and wailing in Ramah. Rachel is weeping uncontrollably for her children. And she refuses to be comforted, because they are dead and gone.</verse>
				<verse number="19">After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared again to Joseph in a dream while he was still in Egypt,</verse>
				<verse number="20">saying, “Go back to the land of Israel and take the child and his mother with you, for those who sought to kill the child are dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">So he awoke and took Jesus and Mary and returned to the land of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But when he heard that Archelaus, Herod’s son, had succeeded him as ruler over all of the territory of Judah, he was afraid to go back. Then he had another dream from God, warning him to avoid that region and instructing him instead to go to the province of Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So he settled his family in the village of Nazareth, fulfilling the prophecy that he would be known as the “Branch.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">It was at this time that John the Baptizer began to preach in the desert of Judah. His message was this:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Heaven’s kingdom is about to appear—so you’d better keep turning away from evil and turn back to God!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Isaiah was referring to John when he prophesied: A thunderous voice! One will be crying out in the wilderness, “Prepare yourself for the Lord’s coming and level a straight path inside your hearts for him.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now, John wore clothing made from camel’s hair, tied at his waist with a leather strap, and his food consisted of dried locusts and wild honey.</verse>
				<verse number="5">A steady stream of people from Jerusalem, all the surrounding countryside, and the region near the Jordan came out to the wilderness to be baptized by him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And while they were publicly confessing their sins, he would immerse them in the Jordan River.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But when he saw many coming from among the wealthy elite of Jewish society and many of the religious leaders known as Pharisees coming to witness the baptism, he began to denounce them, saying, “You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to slither away like snakes from the fire of God’s judgment?</verse>
				<verse number="8">You must prove your repentance by a changed life.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And don’t presume you can get away with merely saying to yourselves, ‘But we’re Abraham’s descendants!’ For I tell you, God can awaken these stones to become sons of Abraham!</verse>
				<verse number="10">The axe is now ready to cut down the trees at their very roots. Every fruitless, rotten tree will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Those who repent I baptize with water, but there is coming a man after me who is more powerful than I. In fact, I’m not even worthy enough to pick up his sandals. He will submerge you into union with the Spirit of Holiness and with a raging fire!</verse>
				<verse number="12">He comes with a winnowing fork in his hands and comes to his threshing floor to sift what is worthless from what is pure. And he is ready to sweep out his threshing floor and gather his wheat into his granary, but the straw he will burn up with a fire that can’t be extinguished!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Jesus left Galilee to come to the Jordan to be baptized by John.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But when he waded into the water, John resisted him, saying, “Why are you doing this? I’m the one who needs to be baptized by you, and yet you come to be baptized by me?”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Jesus replied, “It is only right to do all that God requires.” Then John baptized Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And as Jesus rose up out of the water, the heavenly realm opened up over him and he saw the Holy Spirit descend out of the heavens and rest upon him in the form of a dove.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then suddenly the voice of the Father shouted from the sky, saying, “This is my Son—the Beloved! My greatest delight is in him.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Afterward, the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to experience the ordeal of testing by the accuser.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And after fasting for forty days, Jesus was extremely hungry.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then the tempter came to him and said, “How can you possibly be the Son of God and go hungry? Just command these stones to be turned into loaves of bread.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">He answered, “The Scriptures say: Bread alone will not satisfy, but true life is found in every word that constantly goes forth from God’s mouth.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the accuser transported Jesus to the holy city of Jerusalem and perched him at the highest point of the temple</verse>
				<verse number="6">and said to him, “If you’re really God’s Son, jump, and the angels will catch you. For it is written in the Scriptures: He will command his angels to protect you and they will lift you up so that you won’t even bruise your foot on a rock.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Once again Jesus said to him, “The Scriptures say: You must never put the Lord your God to a test.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">And the third time the accuser lifted Jesus up onto a very high mountain range and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and all the splendor that goes with it.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“All of these kingdoms I will give to you,” the accuser said, “if only you will kneel down before me and worship me.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">But Jesus said, “Go away, Satan! For the Scriptures say: Kneel before the Lord your God and worship only him.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">At once the accuser left him, and angels suddenly gathered around Jesus to minister to his needs.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When Jesus heard that John the Baptizer had been thrown into prison, he went back into Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Jesus moved from Nazareth to make his home in Capernaum, which is by Lake Galilee in the land of Zebulun and Naphtali.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He did this to make the prophecy of Isaiah come true:</verse>
				<verse number="15">Listen, you who live in the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, along the road to the sea and on the other side of the Jordan, and Galilee—the land of the Gentiles!</verse>
				<verse number="16">You who spend your days shrouded in darkness can now say, “We have seen a brilliant Light.” And those who live in the dark shadow land of death can now say, “The Dawning Light arises on us.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">From that time on Jesus began to proclaim his message with these words: “Keep turning away from your sins and come back to God, for heaven’s kingdom realm is now accessible.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">As he was walking by the shore of Lake Galilee, Jesus noticed two fishermen who were brothers. One was nicknamed Keefa (later called Peter), and the other was Andrew, his brother. Watching as they were casting their nets into the water,</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus called out to them and said, “Come and follow me, and I will transform you into men who catch people for God.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Immediately they dropped their nets and left everything behind to follow Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Leaving there, Jesus found three other men sitting in a boat, mending their nets. Two were brothers, Jacob and John, and they were with their father, Zebedee. Jesus called Jacob and John to his side and said to them, “Come and follow me.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">And at once they left their boat and their father, and began to follow Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus ministered from place to place throughout all of the province of Galilee. He taught in the synagogues, preaching the wonderful news of the kingdom and healing every kind of sickness and disease among the people.</verse>
				<verse number="24">His fame spread throughout all Syria! Many people who were in pain and suffering with every kind of illness were brought to Jesus for their healing—epileptics, paralytics, and those tormented by demonic powers were all set free. Everyone who was brought to Jesus was healed!</verse>
				<verse number="25">This resulted in massive crowds of people following him, including people from Galilee, Jerusalem, the land of Judah, the region of the Ten Cities known as the Decapolis, and beyond the Jordan River.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">One day Jesus saw a vast crowd of people gathering to hear him, so he went up the slope of a hill and sat down. With his followers and disciples spread over the hillside,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Jesus began to teach them:</verse>
				<verse number="3">“What happiness comes to you when you feel your spiritual poverty! For yours is the realm of heaven’s kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“What delight comes to you when you wait upon the Lord! For you will find what you long for.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“What blessing comes to you when gentleness lives in you! For you will inherit the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“How enriched you are when you crave righteousness! For you will be satisfied.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“How blessed you are when you demonstrate tender mercy! For tender mercy will be demonstrated to you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“What bliss you experience when your heart is pure! For then your eyes will open to see more and more of God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“How joyful you are when you make peace! For then you will be recognized as a true child of God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“How enriched you are when persecuted for doing what is right! For then you experience the realm of heaven’s kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“How blessed you are when people insult and persecute you and speak all kinds of cruel lies about you because of your love for me!</verse>
				<verse number="12">So leap for joy—since your heavenly reward is great. For you are being rejected the same way the prophets were before you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Your lives are like salt among the people. But if you, like salt, become bland, how can your ‘saltiness’ be restored? Flavorless salt is good for nothing and will be thrown out and trampled on by others.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Your lives light up the world. For how can you hide a city that stands on a hilltop?</verse>
				<verse number="15">And who would light a lamp and then hide it in an obscure place? Instead, it’s placed where everyone in the house can benefit from its light.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So don’t hide your light! Let it shine brightly before others, so that your commendable works will shine as light upon them, and then they will give their praise to your Father in heaven.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“If you think I’ve come to set aside the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets, you’re mistaken. I have come to bring to perfection all that has been written.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Indeed, I assure you, as long as heaven and earth endure, not even the smallest detail of the Law will be done away with until its purpose is complete.</verse>
				<verse number="19">So whoever violates even the least important of the commandments, and teaches others to do so, will be called least in heaven’s kingdom. But whoever obeys them and teaches their truths to others will be called great in heaven’s kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For I tell you, unless your lives are more pure and full of integrity than the religious scholars and the Pharisees, you will never enter heaven’s kingdom.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">“You’re familiar with the commandment taught to those of old: ‘Do not murder or you will be judged.’</verse>
				<verse number="22">But I’m telling you, if you hold anger in your heart toward a fellow believer, you are subject to judgment. And whoever demeans and insults a fellow believer is answerable to the congregation. And whoever calls down curses upon a fellow believer is in danger of being sent to a fiery hell.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“So then, if you are presenting a gift before the altar and suddenly you remember a quarrel you have with a fellow believer,</verse>
				<verse number="24">leave your gift there in front of the altar and go at once to apologize to the one who is offended. Then, after you have reconciled, come to the altar and present your gift.</verse>
				<verse number="25">It is always better to come to terms with the one who wants to sue you before you go to trial, or you may be found guilty by the judge, and he will hand you over to the officers, who will throw you into prison.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Believe me, you won’t get out of prison until you have paid the full amount!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Your ancestors have been taught, ‘Never commit adultery.’</verse>
				<verse number="28">However, I say to you, if you look with lust in your eyes at a woman who is not your wife, you’ve already committed adultery in your heart.</verse>
				<verse number="29">If your right eye seduces you to fall into sin, then go blind in your right eye! For you’re better off losing sight in one eye than to have your whole body thrown into hell.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And if your right hand entices you to sin, let it go limp and useless! For you’re better off losing a part of your body than to have it all thrown into hell.</verse>
				<verse number="31">“It has been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her legal divorce papers.’</verse>
				<verse number="32">However, I say to you, if anyone divorces his wife for any reason, except for infidelity, he causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">“Again, your ancestors were taught, ‘Never swear an oath that you don’t intend to keep, but keep your vows to the Lord God.’</verse>
				<verse number="34">However, I say to you, don’t bind yourself by taking an oath at all. Don’t swear by heaven, for heaven is where God’s throne is placed.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Don’t swear an oath by the earth, because it is the rug under God’s feet, and not by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King.</verse>
				<verse number="36">And why would you swear by your own head, because it’s not in your power to turn a single hair white or black? But just let your words ring true.</verse>
				<verse number="37">A simple ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ will suffice. Anything beyond this springs from a deceiver.</verse>
				<verse number="38">“Your ancestors have also been taught, ‘Take an eye in exchange for an eye and a tooth in exchange for a tooth.’</verse>
				<verse number="39">However, I say to you, don’t repay an evil act with another evil act. But whoever insults you by slapping you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.</verse>
				<verse number="40">If someone is determined to sue you for your coat, give him the shirt off your back as a gift in return.</verse>
				<verse number="41">And should people in authority take advantage of you, do more than what they demand.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Learn to generously share what you have with those who ask for help, and don’t close your heart to the one who comes to borrow from you.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">“Your ancestors have also been taught ‘Love your neighbors and hate the one who hates you.’</verse>
				<verse number="44">However, I say to you, love your enemy, bless the one who curses you, do something wonderful for the one who hates you, and respond to the very ones who persecute you by praying for them.</verse>
				<verse number="45">For that will reveal your identity as children of your heavenly Father. He is kind to all by bringing the sunrise to warm and rainfall to refresh whether a person does what is good or evil.</verse>
				<verse number="46">What reward do you deserve if you only love the loveable? Don’t even the tax collectors do that?</verse>
				<verse number="47">How are you any different from others if you limit your kindness only to your friends? Don’t even the ungodly do that?</verse>
				<verse number="48">Since you are children of a perfect Father in heaven, become perfect like him.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">“Examine your motives to make sure you’re not showing off when you do your good deeds, only to be admired by others; otherwise, you will lose the reward of your heavenly Father.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So when you give to the poor, don’t announce it and make a show of it just to be seen by people, like the hypocrites in the streets and in the marketplace. They’ve already received their reward!</verse>
				<verse number="3">But when you demonstrate generosity, do it with pure motives and without drawing attention to yourself.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Give secretly and your Father, who sees all you do, will reward you openly.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Whenever you pray, be sincere and not like the pretenders who love the attention they receive while praying before others in the meetings and on street corners. Believe me, they’ve already received their reward.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But whenever you pray, go into your innermost chamber and be alone with Father God, praying to him in secret. And your Father, who sees all you do, will reward you openly.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When you pray, there is no need to repeat empty phrases, praying like the Gentiles do, for they expect God to hear them because of their many words.</verse>
				<verse number="8">There is no need to imitate them, since your Father already knows what you need before you ask him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Pray like this: ‘Our Beloved Father, dwelling in the heavenly realms, may the glory of your name be the center on which our lives turn.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Manifest your kingdom realm, and cause your every purpose to be fulfilled on earth, just as it is in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="11">We acknowledge you as our Provider of all we need each day.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Forgive us the wrongs we have done as we ourselves release forgiveness to those who have wronged us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Rescue us every time we face tribulation and set us free from evil. For you are the King who rules with power and glory forever. Amen.’</verse>
				<verse number="14">“ And when you pray, make sure you forgive the faults of others so that your Father in heaven will also forgive you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But if you withhold forgiveness from others, your Father withholds forgiveness from you.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">“When you fast, don’t look gloomy and pretend to be spiritual. They want everyone to know they’re fasting, so they appear in public looking miserable and disheveled. Believe me, they’ve already received their reward.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When you fast, don’t let it be obvious, but instead, wash your face and groom yourself and realize that your Father in the secret place is the one who is watching all that you do in secret and will continue to reward you.”</verse>
				<verse number="18"></verse>
				<verse number="19">“Don’t keep hoarding for yourselves earthly treasures that can be stolen by thieves. Material wealth eventually rusts, decays, and loses its value.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Instead, stockpile heavenly treasures for yourselves that cannot be stolen and will never rust, decay, or lose their value.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For your heart will always pursue what you esteem as your treasure.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“The eyes of your spirit allow revelation-light to enter into your being. If your heart is unclouded, the light floods in!</verse>
				<verse number="23">But if your eyes are focused on money, the light cannot penetrate and darkness takes its place. How profound will be the darkness within you if the light of truth cannot enter!</verse>
				<verse number="24">“How could you worship two gods at the same time? You will have to hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You can’t worship the true God while enslaved to the god of money!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">“This is why I tell you to never be worried about your life, for all that you need will be provided, such as food, water, clothing—everything your body needs. Isn’t there more to your life than a meal? Isn’t your body more than clothing?</verse>
				<verse number="26">“Consider the birds—do you think they worry about their existence? They don’t plant or reap or store up food, yet your heavenly Father provides them each with food. Aren’t you much more valuable to your Father than they?</verse>
				<verse number="27">So, which one of you by worrying could add anything to your life?</verse>
				<verse number="28">“And why would you worry about your clothing? Look at all the beautiful flowers of the field. They don’t work or toil,</verse>
				<verse number="29">and yet not even Solomon in all his splendor was robed in beauty like one of these!</verse>
				<verse number="30">So if God has clothed the meadow with hay, which is here for such a short time and then dried up and burned, won’t he provide for you the clothes you need—you of little faith?</verse>
				<verse number="31">“So then, forsake your worries! Why would you say, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’</verse>
				<verse number="32">For that is what the unbelievers chase after. Doesn’t your heavenly Father already know the things your bodies require?</verse>
				<verse number="33">“So above all, constantly seek God’s kingdom and his righteousness, then all these less important things will be given to you abundantly.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Refuse to worry about tomorrow, but deal with each challenge that comes your way, one day at a time. Tomorrow will take care of itself.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">“Refuse to be a critic full of bias toward others, and you will not be judged.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For you’ll be judged by the same standard that you’ve used to judge others. The measurement you use on them will be used on you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Why would you focus on the flaw in someone else’s life and fail to notice the glaring flaws of your own?</verse>
				<verse number="4">How could you say to your friend, ‘Let me show you where you’re wrong,’ when you’re guilty of even more?</verse>
				<verse number="5">You’re being hypercritical and a hypocrite! First acknowledge and deal with your own ‘blind spots,’ and then you’ll be capable of dealing with the ‘blind spot’ of your friend.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Who would hang earrings on a dog’s ear or throw pearls in front of wild pigs? They’ll only trample them under their feet and then turn around and tear you to pieces!</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Ask, and the gift is yours. Seek, and you’ll discover. Knock, and the door will be opened for you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For every persistent one will get what he asks for. Every persistent seeker will discover what he longs for. And everyone who knocks persistently will one day find an open door.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Do you know of any parent who would give his hungry child, who asked for food, a plate of rocks instead?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Or when asked for a piece of fish, what parent would offer his child a snake instead?</verse>
				<verse number="11">If you, imperfect as you are, know how to lovingly take care of your children and give them what’s best, how much more ready is your heavenly Father to give wonderful gifts to those who ask him?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">“In everything you do, be careful to treat others in the same way you’d want them to treat you, for that is the essence of all the teachings of the Law and the Prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Enter through the narrow gate because the wide gate and broad path is the way that leads to destruction—nearly everyone chooses that crowded road!</verse>
				<verse number="14">The narrow gate and the difficult way leads to eternal life—so few even find it!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Constantly be on your guard against phony prophets. They come disguised as lambs, appearing to be genuine, but on the inside they are like wild, ravenous wolves!</verse>
				<verse number="16">You can spot them by their actions, for the fruits of their character will be obvious. You won’t find sweet grapes hanging on a thorn bush, and you’ll never pick good fruit from a tumbleweed.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So if the tree is good, it will produce good fruit; but if the tree is bad, it will bear only rotten fruit and deserves to be cut down and burned.</verse>
				<verse number="18"></verse>
				<verse number="19"></verse>
				<verse number="20">You’ll know them by the obvious fruit of their lives and ministries.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into heaven’s kingdom. It is only those who persist in doing the will of my heavenly Father.</verse>
				<verse number="22">On the day of judgment many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, don’t you remember us? Didn’t we prophesy in your name? Didn’t we cast out demons and do many miracles in your name?’</verse>
				<verse number="23">But I will have to say to them, ‘Go away from me, you lawless rebels! I’ve never been joined to you!’</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Everyone who hears my teaching and applies it to his life can be compared to a wise man who built his house on an unshakable foundation.</verse>
				<verse number="25">When the rains fell and the flood came, with fierce winds beating upon his house, it stood firm because of its strong foundation.</verse>
				<verse number="26">“But everyone who hears my teaching and does not apply it to his life can be compared to a foolish man who built his house on sand.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When it rained and rained and the flood came, with wind and waves beating upon his house, it collapsed and was swept away.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">By the time Jesus finished speaking, the crowds were awestruck by his teaching,</verse>
				<verse number="29">because his words carried such great authority, quite unlike the religious scholars.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">After he came down from teaching on the hillside, massive crowds began following him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Suddenly, a leper walked up to Jesus and threw himself down before him in worship and said, “Lord, you have the power to heal me . . . if you really want to.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus reached out his hand and touched the leper and said, “Of course I want to heal you—be healed!” And instantly, all signs of leprosy disappeared!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Jesus said to him, “Don’t speak to anyone, but go at once and find a priest and show him what has happened to you. Make sure to take the offering Moses commanded so he can certify your healing.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">When Jesus entered the village of Capernaum, a captain in the Roman army approached him, asking for a miracle.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Lord,” he said, “I have a son who is lying in my home, paralyzed and suffering terribly.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jesus responded, “I will go with you and heal him.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But the Roman officer interjected, “Lord, who am I to have you come into my house? I understand your authority, for I too am a man who walks under authority and have authority over soldiers who serve under me. I can tell one to go and he’ll go, and another to come and he’ll come. I command my servants and they’ll do whatever I ask. So I know that all you need to do is to stand here and command healing over my son and he will be instantly healed.”</verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus was astonished when he heard this and said to those who were following him, “He has greater faith than anyone I’ve encountered in Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Listen to what I am about to tell you. Multitudes of Gentiles will stream from the east and the west, to enter into the heavenly kingdom with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But many Israelites, born to be heirs of the kingdom, will be turned away and banished into the darkness where there will be bitter weeping and unbearable anguish.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Jesus turned to the Roman officer and said, “Go home. All that you have believed for will be done for you!” And his son was healed at that very moment.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Jesus entered Peter’s home and found Peter’s mother-in-law bedridden, severely ill with a fever.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The moment Jesus touched her hand she was healed! Immediately she got up and began to make dinner for them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">That evening the people brought to him many who were demonized. And by Jesus only speaking a word of healing over them, they were totally set free from their torment, and everyone who was sick received their healing!</verse>
				<verse number="17">In doing this, Jesus fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: He put upon himself our weaknesses, and he carried away our diseases and made us well.</verse>
				<verse number="18">At the sight of large crowds gathering around him, Jesus gave orders to his disciples to get ready to sail back over to the other side of the lake.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Just then, a religious scholar approached him and said, “Teacher, I’ll follow you wherever you go!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens, birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no true home in this world.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then another man spoke up and said, “Lord, I’ll follow you, but first I must take care of my aged father and bury him when he dies.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">But Jesus said to him, “Now is the time to follow me, and let those who are dead bury their own dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">They all got into a boat and began to cross over to the other side of the lake. And Jesus, exhausted, fell asleep.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Suddenly a violent storm developed, with waves so high the boat was about to be swamped. Yet Jesus continued to sleep soundly.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The disciples woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We’re going to die!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">But Jesus reprimanded them. “Why are you gripped with fear? Where is your faith?” Then he stood and rebuked the storm, saying, “Be still!” And instantly it became perfectly calm.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The disciples were astonished by this miracle and said to one another, “Who is this Man? Even the wind and waves obey his Word.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">When they arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes, two demonized men confronted Jesus. They lived among the tombs of a cemetery and were considered so extremely violent that no one felt safe passing through that area.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The demons screamed at Jesus, shouting, “Son of God, what do you want with us? Leave us alone! Have you come to torment us before the appointed time?”</verse>
				<verse number="30">There was a large herd of pigs feeding nearby.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And the demons pleaded, “If you cast us out, send us into that herd of pigs.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Jesus commanded, “Then go!” And at once the demons came out of the men and went into the pigs. Then the entire herd of crazed pigs stampeded down the steep slope and fell into the water and drowned.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The men who were herding the pigs fled to the nearby town and informed the people of all that had happened to the demonized men.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then everyone from the town went out to confront Jesus and urged him to go away and leave them alone.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Jesus got into the boat and returned to what was considered his hometown, Capernaum.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Just then some people brought a paraplegic man to him, lying on a sleeping mat. When Jesus perceived the strong faith within their hearts, he said to the paralyzed man, “My son, be encouraged, for your sins have been forgiven.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">These words prompted some of the religious scholars to think, “Why, that’s nothing but blasphemy!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus supernaturally perceived their thoughts, and said to them, “Why do you carry such evil in your hearts?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or, ‘Stand up and walk!’?</verse>
				<verse number="6">But now, to convince you that the Son of Man has been given authority to forgive sins, I say to this man, ‘Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk home.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Immediately the man sprang to his feet and left for home.</verse>
				<verse number="8">When the crowds witnessed this miracle, they were awestruck. They shouted praises to God because he had given such authority to human beings.</verse>
				<verse number="9">As Jesus left Capernaum he came upon a tax-collecting station, where a Jewish man named Matthew was collecting taxes for the Romans. “Come, follow me,” Jesus said to him. Immediately Matthew jumped up and began to follow Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus went to Matthew’s house and made himself at home. Many other tax collectors and outcasts of society were invited to eat with Jesus and his disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When those known as the Pharisees saw what was happening, they were indignant, and they kept asking Jesus’ disciples, “Why would your Master dine with such lowlifes?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">When Jesus overheard this, he spoke up and said, “Healthy people don’t need to see a doctor, but the sick will go for treatment.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then he added, “Now you should go and study the meaning of the verse: I want you to show mercy, not just offer me a sacrifice. For I have come to invite the outcasts of society and sinners, not those who think they are already on the right path.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">The disciples of John the Baptizer approached Jesus with this question: “Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast regularly, but not your disciples?”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Jesus replied, “How can the sons of the bridal chamber grieve when the Bridegroom is next to them? But the days of fasting will come when the Bridegroom is taken away from them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And who would mend worn-out clothing with new fabric? When the new cloth shrinks it will rip, making the hole worse than before.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And who would pour fresh, new wine into an old wineskin? Eventually the wine will ferment and make the wineskin burst, losing everything—the wine is spilled and the wineskin ruined. Instead, new wine is always poured into a new wineskin so that both are preserved.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">While Jesus was still speaking, an influential Jewish leader approached and knelt before him, saying, “Help me! My daughter has just died. Please come and place your hand upon her so that she will live again.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So Jesus and his disciples got up and went with him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Suddenly, a woman came from behind Jesus and touched the tassel of his prayer shawl for healing. She had been suffering from continual bleeding for twelve years, but had faith that Jesus could heal her.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For she kept saying to herself, “If I could only touch his prayer shawl I would be healed.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Just then Jesus turned around and looked at her and said, “My daughter, be encouraged. Your faith has healed you.” And instantly she was healed!</verse>
				<verse number="23">When Jesus finally entered the home of the Jewish leader, he saw a noisy crowd of mourners, wailing and playing a funeral dirge on their flutes.</verse>
				<verse number="24">He told them, “You must leave, for the little girl is not dead; she’s only asleep.” Then everyone began to ridicule him.</verse>
				<verse number="25">After he made the crowd go outside, he went into the girl’s room and gently took hold of her hand. She immediately stood to her feet!</verse>
				<verse number="26">And the news of this incredible miracle spread everywhere.</verse>
				<verse number="27">As Jesus left the house, two blind men began following him, shouting out over and over, “Son of David, show us mercy and heal us!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">And they followed him right into the house where Jesus was staying. So Jesus asked them, “Do you believe that I have the power to restore sight to your eyes?” They replied, “Yes Lord, we believe!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then Jesus put his hands over their eyes and said, “You will have what your faith expects!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">And instantly their eyes opened—they could see! Then Jesus warned them sternly, “Make sure that you tell no one what just happened!”</verse>
				<verse number="31">But unable to contain themselves, they went out and spread the news everywhere!</verse>
				<verse number="32">While they were leaving, some people brought before Jesus a demonized man who couldn’t speak.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Jesus cast the demon out of him, and immediately the man began to speak plainly. The crowds marveled in astonishment, saying, “We’ve never seen miracles like this in Israel!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">But the Pharisees kept saying, “The chief of demons is helping him drive out demons.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Jesus walked throughout the region with the joyful message of God’s kingdom realm. He taught in their meeting houses, and wherever he went he demonstrated God’s power by healing every kind of disease and illness.</verse>
				<verse number="36">When he saw the vast crowds of people, Jesus’ heart was deeply moved with compassion, because they seemed weary and helpless, like wandering sheep without a shepherd.</verse>
				<verse number="37">He turned to his disciples and said, “The harvest is huge and ripe! But there are not enough harvesters to bring it all in.</verse>
				<verse number="38">As you go, plead with the Owner of the Harvest to thrust out many more reapers to harvest his grain!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Jesus gathered his twelve disciples and imparted to them authority to cast out demons and to heal every sickness and every disease.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now, these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is nicknamed Peter, and Andrew, his brother. And then Jacob and John, sons of Zebedee.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Next were Phillip and Bartholomew; then Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector; Jacob the son of Alphaeus; Thaddeus;</verse>
				<verse number="4">Simon, the former member of the Zealot party, and Judas the locksmith, who eventually betrayed Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Jesus sent out the Twelve with these instructions: “Don’t go into any Gentile or Samaritan territory.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Go instead and find the lost sheep among the people of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And as you go, preach this message: ‘Heaven’s kingdom realm is accessible, close enough to touch.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">You must continually bring healing to lepers and to those who are sick, and make it your habit to break off the demonic presence from people, and raise the dead back to life. Freely you have received the power of the kingdom, so freely release it to others.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You won’t need a lot of money.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Travel light, and don’t even pack an extra change of clothes in your backpack. Trust God for everything, because the one who works for him deserves to be provided for.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Whatever village or town you enter, search for an honorable man who will let you into his home until you leave for the next town.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Once you enter a house, speak to the family there and say, ‘God’s blessing of peace be upon this house!’</verse>
				<verse number="13">And if those living there welcome you, let your peace come upon the house. But if you are rejected, that blessing of peace will come back upon you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And if anyone doesn’t listen to you and rejects your message, when you leave that house or town, shake the dust off your feet.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Mark my words, on the day of judgment the wicked people who lived in the land of Sodom and Gomorrah will have a lesser degree of judgment than the city that rejects you, for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah did not have the opportunity that was given to them!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now, remember, it is I who sends you out, even though you feel vulnerable as lambs going into a pack of wolves. So be as shrewd as snakes yet as harmless as doves.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Be on your guard! For there will be those who will betray you before their religious councils and brutally beat you with whips in their public gatherings.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And because you follow me, they will take you to stand trial in front of rulers and even kings as an opportunity to testify of me before them and the unbelievers.</verse>
				<verse number="19">So when they arrest you, don’t worry about how to speak or what you are to say, for the Holy Spirit will give you at that very moment the words to speak.</verse>
				<verse number="20">It won’t be you speaking but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“A brother will betray his brother unto death—even a father his child! Children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Expect to be hated by all because of my name, but be faithful to the end and you will experience life and deliverance.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And when they persecute you in one town, flee to another. But I promise you this: you will not deliver all the cities and towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“A student is not superior to his teacher any more than a servant would be greater than his master.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The student must be satisfied to share his teacher’s fate and the servant his master’s. If they have called the head of the family ‘lord of flies,’ no wonder they malign the members of his family.</verse>
				<verse number="26">“Don’t be afraid or intimidated by others, for God will bring everything out into the open and every secret will be told.</verse>
				<verse number="27">What I say to you in the dark, repeat in broad daylight, and what you hear in a whisper, announce it publicly.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Don’t be in fear of those who can kill only the body but not your soul. Fear only God, who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</verse>
				<verse number="29">You can buy two sparrows for only a copper coin, yet not even one sparrow falls from its nest without the knowledge of your Father. Aren’t you worth much more to God than many sparrows?</verse>
				<verse number="30">So don’t worry. For your Father cares deeply about even the smallest detail of your life.</verse>
				<verse number="31"></verse>
				<verse number="32">“If you openly and publicly acknowledge me, I will freely and openly acknowledge you before my heavenly Father.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But if you publicly deny that you know me, I will also deny you before my heavenly Father.</verse>
				<verse number="34">“Perhaps you think I’ve come to spread peace and calm over the earth—but my coming will bring conflict and division, not peace.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Because of me, A son will turn against his father, a daughter her mother and against her mother-in-law.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Within your own families you will find enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="37">“Whoever loves father or mother or son or daughter more than me is not fit to be my disciple.</verse>
				<verse number="38">And whoever comes to me must follow in my steps and be willing to share my cross and experience it as his own, or he is not worthy of me.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Those who cling to their lives will give up true life. But those who let go of their lives for my sake and surrender it all to me will discover true life!</verse>
				<verse number="40">“Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the One who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Whoever receives a prophet because he is God’s messenger will share a prophet’s reward. And whoever welcomes a righteous person because he follows me will also share in his reward.</verse>
				<verse number="42">And whoever gives a cup of cold water to one of my disciples, I promise you, he will not go unrewarded.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">After Jesus finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he went on to minister in different villages throughout the region.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now, while John the Baptizer was in prison, he heard about the wonderful deeds of the Christ, so he sent his disciples to ask him this question:</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Are you really the one the prophets said would come, or should we still wait for another?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus answered them, “Give John this report:</verse>
				<verse number="5">‘The blind see again, the crippled walk, lepers are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised back to life, and the poor and broken now hear of the hope of salvation!’</verse>
				<verse number="6">And tell John that the blessing of heaven comes to those who are not offended over me.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">As they were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. “What kind of man did you see when you went out into the wilderness? Did you expect to see a man who would be easily intimidated?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Who was he? Did you expect to see a man decked out in the splendid fashion of the day? Those who wear fancy clothes live like kings in palaces.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Or did you encounter a true prophet out in the lonely wilderness? Yes, John was a prophet like those of the past, but he is even more than that!</verse>
				<verse number="10">He was the fulfillment of this Scripture: See, I am sending my prophetic messenger who will go ahead of me and prepare hearts to receive me.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“For I tell you the truth, throughout history there has never been a man who surpasses John the Baptizer. Yet the least of those who now experience heaven’s kingdom will become even greater than he.</verse>
				<verse number="12">From the moment John stepped onto the scene until now, the realm of heaven’s kingdom is bursting forth, and passionate people have taken hold of its power.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For all the prophets and the Torah prophesied until John appeared.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If you can receive this truth, John is the Elijah who was destined to come.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So listen and understand what I’m telling you.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“How could I describe the people of this generation? You’re like children playing games on the playground, yelling at their playmates,</verse>
				<verse number="17">‘You don’t like it when we want to play Wedding! And you don’t like it when we want to play Funeral! You will neither dance nor mourn.’</verse>
				<verse number="18">Why is it that when John came to you, neither feasting nor drinking wine, you said, ‘He has a demon in him!’?</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yet when the Son of Man came and went to feasts and drank wine, you said, ‘Look at this man! He is nothing but a glutton and a drunkard! He spends all his time with tax collectors and other sinners.’ But God’s wisdom will become visible by those who embrace it.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then Jesus began to openly denounce the cities where he had done most of his mighty miracles, because the people failed to turn away from sin and return to God.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He said, “How tragic it will be for the city of Korazin! And how horrible for the city of Bethsaida! For if the powerful miracles that I performed in Korazin and Bethsaida had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have humbled themselves and repented, and turned from their sins.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Tyre and Sidon will be better off on judgment day than you!</verse>
				<verse number="23">And Capernaum—do you really think you’ll be exalted because of the great miracles I have done there? No! You’ll be brought down to the depths of hell because of your rejection of me. For if the miracles I worked in your streets were done in Sodom, it would still be standing today!</verse>
				<verse number="24">But I tell you, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom in the day of judgment than it will be for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then Jesus exclaimed, “Father, thank you, for you are Lord, the Supreme Ruler over heaven and earth! And you have hidden the great revelation of your authority from those who are proud and think they are wise and unveiled it instead to little children.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Yes, Father, you’ve chosen this gracious plan to extend your kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="27">You have entrusted me with all that you are and all that you have. No one fully and intimately knows the Son except the Father. And no one fully and intimately knows the Father except the Son. But the Son is able to unveil the Father to anyone he chooses.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Are you weary, carrying a heavy burden? Come to me. I will refresh your life, for I am your oasis.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Simply join your life with mine. Learn my ways and you’ll discover that I’m gentle, humble, easy to please. You will find refreshment and rest in me.</verse>
				<verse number="30">For all that I require of you will be pleasant and easy to bear.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">One Saturday, on the day of rest, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of wheat. The disciples were hungry, so they plucked off some heads of grain and rubbed them in their hands to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But when some of the Pharisees saw what was happening, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples shouldn’t be harvesting grain on the Sabbath!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus responded, “Haven’t you ever read what King David and his men did when they were hungry?</verse>
				<verse number="4">They entered the house of God and ate the sacred bread of God’s presence, violating the law by eating bread that only the priests were allowed to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“And haven’t you read in the Torah that the priests violated the rules of the Sabbath by carrying out their duties in the temple on a Saturday, and yet they are without blame?</verse>
				<verse number="6">But I say to you, there is one here who is even greater than the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If only you could learn the meaning of the words ‘I want compassion more than a sacrifice,’ you wouldn’t be condemning my innocent disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For the Son of Man exercises his lordship over the Sabbath.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Jesus left them and went into the synagogue where</verse>
				<verse number="10">he encountered a man who had an atrophied, paralyzed hand. The fault-finding Pharisees asked Jesus, “Is it permissible to perform a work of healing on the Sabbath?” They only asked him this question because they hoped to accuse him of breaking the Jewish laws.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He answered them, “If any of you had a lamb that fell into a ditch on the Sabbath, wouldn’t you reach out your hand and lift it out?</verse>
				<verse number="12">Isn’t a man much more valuable than a lamb? So of course, it’s always proper to do miracles, even on the Sabbath.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then he turned to the man and said, “Hold out your hand!” And as he stretched it out, it was restored, exactly like the other.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Immediately the Pharisees went out and started to scheme about how they would destroy him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he left by another way. Massive crowds followed him from there, and he healed all who were sick.</verse>
				<verse number="16">However, he sternly warned them not to tell others or disclose his real identity,</verse>
				<verse number="17">in order to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah:</verse>
				<verse number="18">Take a careful look at my servant, my chosen one. I love him dearly and I find all my delight in him. I will breathe my Spirit upon him and he will decree justice to the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He will not quarrel or raise his voice in public.</verse>
				<verse number="20">He won’t brush aside the bruised and broken. He will be gentle with the weak and feeble, until his victory releases justice.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And the fame of his name will birth hope among the people.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then a man was brought before Jesus who had a demon spirit that made him both blind and mute. Jesus healed him instantly, and he could see and talk again!</verse>
				<verse number="23">The crowds went wild with amazement as they witnessed this miracle. And they kept saying to one another, “Could this man be the Messiah?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">But when the Pharisees overheard what the people were saying, they said, “He casts out demons by the power of Satan, the prince of demons!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus supernaturally perceived their thoughts and motives, so he told them this parable: “Any kingdom that fights against itself is reduced to ruins. And any family or community splintered by strife will fall apart.</verse>
				<verse number="26">So if Satan casts out Satan, he is making war on himself. How then could his kingdom stand?</verse>
				<verse number="27">So if Satan empowers me to cast out demons, who empowers your exorcists to cast them out? Go ask them, let them be your judges.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But, if I drive out demons by the power of the Spirit of God, then the end of Satan’s kingdom has come!</verse>
				<verse number="29">Who would dare enter the house of a mighty man and steal his property? First he must be overpowered and tied up by one who is stronger than he. Then his entire house can be plundered.</verse>
				<verse number="30">“ So join with me, for if you’re not on my side you are against me. And if you refuse to help me gather the spoils, you are making things worse.</verse>
				<verse number="31">This is why I warn you. God will forgive people for every sin and blasphemy except one. There is no forgiveness for the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="32">If anyone speaks evil of me, the Son of Man, he can be forgiven; but if anyone speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will never be forgiven, now or ever!”</verse>
				<verse number="33">“You must determine if a tree is good or rotten. You can recognize good trees by their delicious fruit. But if you find rotten fruit, you can be certain that the tree is rotten. The fruit defines the tree.</verse>
				<verse number="34">But you who are known as the Pharisees are rotten to the core like venomous snakes. How can your words be good if you are rotten within? For what has been stored up in your hearts will be heard in the overflow of your words!</verse>
				<verse number="35">“When virtue is stored within, the hearts of good, upright people will produce good fruit. But when evil is hidden within, those who are evil will produce evil fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="36">You can be sure of this: when the day of judgment comes, everyone will be held accountable for every careless word he has spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Your very words will be used as evidence, and your words will declare you either innocent or guilty.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then a few Jewish scholars and Pharisees spoke up and said, “Teacher, why don’t you perform a miraculous sign for us.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Jesus replied, “Only evil people who are unfaithful to God would demand a sign. There will be no sign given to you except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</verse>
				<verse number="40">For as Jonah was in the belly of the huge sea creature for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.</verse>
				<verse number="41">The people of Nineveh will also rise up on the day of judgment to condemn this generation. For they all repented when they heard the preaching of Jonah. And there is one greater than Jonah here preaching to you today!</verse>
				<verse number="42">Even the Queen of Sheba will rise up on the day of judgment to condemn this generation for its unbelief! She journeyed from a far and distant land just to hear the wisdom of King Solomon. Yet now there is one greater than Solomon speaking to you today.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">“When a demon is cast out of a person, it roams around a dry region, looking for a place to rest, but never finds it.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Then it says, ‘I’ll return to the house I moved out of,’ and so it goes back, only to find that the house is vacant, warm, and ready for it to move back in.</verse>
				<verse number="45">So it goes looking for seven other demons more evil than itself, and they all enter together to live there. Then the person’s condition becomes much worse than it was in the beginning. This describes what will also happen to the people of this evil generation.”</verse>
				<verse number="46">While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers came and stood outside, asking for him to come out and speak with them.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Then someone said, “Look, your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to have a word with you.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">But Jesus just looked at him and said, “Let me introduce you to my true mother and brothers.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">Then gesturing to the disciples gathered around him, he said, “Look closely, for this is my true family.</verse>
				<verse number="50">When you obey my heavenly Father, that makes you a part of my true family.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Later that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lakeshore to teach the people.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Soon, there were so many people surrounding him that he had to teach sitting in a boat while the large crowd stood on the shore.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He taught them many things by using stories, parables to illustrate spiritual truths, saying: “Consider this: There was a farmer who went out to sow seeds.</verse>
				<verse number="4">As he cast his seeds, some fell along the beaten path and the birds came and ate them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Others fell onto gravel that had no topsoil. They quickly shot up,</verse>
				<verse number="6">but when the days grew hot, they were scorched and withered because they had insufficient roots.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Others fell among the thorns, so when they sprouted, the thorns choked them.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But other seeds fell on good, rich soil that kept producing a good harvest. Some yielded thirty, some sixty, and some even one hundred times as much as he planted!</verse>
				<verse number="9">If you’re able to understand this, then you need to respond.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then his disciples approached Jesus and asked, “Why do you always speak to people in these hard-to-understand parables?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">He explained, “You’ve been given the intimate experience of insight into the hidden mysteries of the realm of heaven’s kingdom, but they have not.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For everyone who listens with an open heart will receive progressively more revelation until he has more than enough. But those who don’t listen with an open, teachable heart, even the understanding that they think they have will be taken from them.</verse>
				<verse number="13">That’s why I teach the people using parables, because they think they’re looking for truth, yet because their hearts are unteachable, they never discover it. Although they will listen to me, they never fully perceive the message I speak.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The prophecy of Isaiah describes them perfectly: Although they listen carefully to everything I speak, they don’t understand a thing I say. They look and pretend to see, but the eyes of their hearts are closed.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Their minds are dull and slow to perceive, their ears are plugged and are hard of hearing, and they have deliberately shut their eyes to the truth. Otherwise they would open their eyes to see, and open their ears to hear, and open their minds to understand. Then they would turn to me and I would instantly heal them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“But blissful are your eyes, for they see. Delighted are your ears, for they are open to hear all these things.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Many prophets and godly people yearned to see these days of miracles that you’ve been favored to see. They would have given everything to hear the revelation you’ve been favored to hear.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Now you are ready to hear the explanation of the parable of the sower:</verse>
				<verse number="19">“What was sown along the path represents the one who listens to the message of the kingdom but doesn’t understand it. The Adversary then comes and snatches away what was sown into his heart.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“The one sown on gravel represents the person who gladly hears the kingdom message, but his experience remains shallow.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Shortly after he hears it, troubles and persecutions come because of the kingdom message he received. Then he quickly falls away, for the truth didn’t sink deeply into his heart.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“The one sown among thorns represents one who receives the message, but all of life’s busy distractions, his divided heart, and his ambition for wealth result in suffocating the kingdom message and it becomes fruitless.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“But what was sown on good, rich soil represents the one who hears and fully embraces the message of the kingdom. Their lives bear good fruit—some yield a harvest of thirty, sixty, even one hundred times as much as was sown.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then Jesus taught them another parable: “Heaven’s kingdom can be compared to a farmer who planted good seed in his field.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But when everyone was asleep, an enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat and ran away.</verse>
				<verse number="26">When the wheat sprouted and bore grain, the weeds also appeared.</verse>
				<verse number="27">So the farmer’s hired hands came to him and said, ‘Sir, wasn’t that good seed that you sowed in the field? Where did all these weeds come from?’</verse>
				<verse number="28">“He answered, ‘This has to be the work of an enemy!’ “They replied, ‘Do you want us to go and gather up all the weeds?’</verse>
				<verse number="29">“ ‘No,’ he said. ‘If you pull out the weeds you might uproot the wheat at the same time.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Let them both grow together until the harvest. At that time, I’ll tell my harvesters to gather the weeds first and tie them all in bundles to be burned. Then they will harvest the wheat and put it into my barn.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then Jesus taught them another parable: “Heaven’s kingdom can be compared to the tiny mustard seed that a man takes and plants in his field.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Although the smallest of all the seeds, it eventually grows into the greatest of garden plants, becoming a tree for birds to come and build their nests in its branches.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then he taught them another parable: “Heaven’s kingdom can be compared to yeast that a woman takes and blends into three measures of flour and then waits until all the dough rises.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Whenever Jesus addressed the crowds, he always spoke in allegories. He never spoke without using parables.</verse>
				<verse number="35">He did this to fulfill the prophecy: I will speak to you in allegories. I will reveal secrets that have been concealed since before the foundation of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Jesus left the crowds and went inside the house where he was staying. Then his disciples approached him and asked, “Please explain the deeper meaning of the parable of the weeds growing in the field of wheat.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">He answered, “The man who sowed his field with good seed is the Son of Man.</verse>
				<verse number="38">And the field is the world. The good seeds I sow are the children of the kingdom realm. The weeds are the children of the Evil One,</verse>
				<verse number="39">and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest points to the end of this age, and the harvesters are God’s messengers.</verse>
				<verse number="40">As the weeds are bundled up and thrown into the fire, so it will be at the close of the age.</verse>
				<verse number="41">The Son of Man will send his messengers, and they will uproot everything out of his kingdom. All the lawless ones and everything that causes sin will be removed.</verse>
				<verse number="42">And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where they will experience great sorrow and anguish.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Then the righteous will shine like the brightness of the sun in their Father’s kingdom realm. If you’re able to understand this, then you’d better respond!”</verse>
				<verse number="44">“Heaven’s kingdom realm can be illustrated like this: “A person discovered that there was hidden treasure in a field. Upon finding it, he hid it again. Because of uncovering such treasure, he was overjoyed and sold all that he possessed to buy the entire field just so he could have the treasure.</verse>
				<verse number="45">“Heaven’s kingdom realm is also like a jewel merchant in search of rare pearls.</verse>
				<verse number="46">When he discovered one very precious and exquisite pearl, he immediately gave up all he had in exchange for it.”</verse>
				<verse number="47">“Again, heaven’s kingdom realm is like a fisherman who casts his large net into the lake, catching an assortment of fish.</verse>
				<verse number="48">When the net was filled, the fishermen hauled it up on the shore, and they all sat down to sort out their catch. They collected the good in baskets and threw the bad away.</verse>
				<verse number="49">And so it will be at the close of the age. The messengers will come and separate the evil from among the godly</verse>
				<verse number="50">and throw them into the fiery furnace, where they will experience great sorrow and anguish.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Now do you understand all this?” “Yes,” they replied.</verse>
				<verse number="52">He responded, “Every scholar of the Scriptures, who is instructed in the ways of heaven’s kingdom realm, is like a wealthy home owner with his house filled with treasures both new and old.”</verse>
				<verse number="53">Right after Jesus taught this series of parables, he left from there.</verse>
				<verse number="54">When Jesus arrived in his hometown of Nazareth, he began teaching the people in the synagogue. Everyone was dazed, overwhelmed with astonishment over the depth of revelation they were hearing. They said to one another, “Where did this man get such great wisdom and miraculous powers?</verse>
				<verse number="55">Isn’t he just the craftsman’s son? Isn’t his mother named Mary, and his four brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah?</verse>
				<verse number="56">And don’t his sisters all live here in Nazareth? From where then did he get all this revelation and power?”</verse>
				<verse number="57">And the people became offended and began to turn against him. Jesus said, “There’s only one place a prophet isn’t honored—his own hometown!”</verse>
				<verse number="58">And their unbelief kept him from doing many mighty miracles in Nazareth.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">At that time Herod, the Roman ruler over Galilee, heard reports about Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He told his officials, “This man has to be John the Baptizer who has come back from the dead. That’s why he has this power to work miracles.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">For Herod had earlier arrested John for confronting him for taking the wife of his brother Philip. He had John thrown in prison and placed in chains</verse>
				<verse number="4">because John had repeatedly said to him, “It’s not legal or proper for you to be married to Herodias, your sister-in-law!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So Herod wanted John dead, but he was afraid of the crowds who flocked to John because they considered him to be a prophet.</verse>
				<verse number="6">During Herod’s birthday celebration, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and all his distinguished guests, which greatly pleased the king.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So he said to her in front of them all, “I give you my oath, ask of me anything you wish and it will be yours!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Because she had been instructed by her mother, she said, “I want the head of John the Baptizer here on a platter!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">This grieved the king, but because of his oath in front of all of his guests,</verse>
				<verse number="10">he had John beheaded in prison.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They brought in his head and displayed it to her on a platter, and she then had it shown to her mother.</verse>
				<verse number="12">John’s disciples went into the prison and carried his body away and buried it. Then they left to find Jesus and tell him what had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="13">On hearing this, Jesus slipped away privately by boat to be alone. But when the crowds discovered he had sailed away, they emerged from all the nearby towns and followed him on foot.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So when Jesus landed he had a huge crowd waiting for him. Seeing so many people, his heart was deeply moved with compassion toward them, so he healed all the sick who were in the crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Later that afternoon the disciples came to Jesus and said, “It’s going to be dark soon and the people are hungry, but there’s nothing to eat here in this desolate place. You should send the crowds away to the nearby villages to buy themselves some food.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">“They don’t need to leave,” Jesus responded. “You can give them something to eat.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">They answered, “But all we have is five barley loaves and two fish.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Let me have them,” Jesus replied.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then he had everyone sit down on the grass and he then took the five loaves and two fish. He looked up into heaven, gave thanks to God, and broke the bread into pieces. He then gave it to his disciples, who in turn gave it to the crowds.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And everyone ate until they were satisfied, for the food was multiplied in front of their eyes! They picked up the leftovers and filled up twelve baskets full!</verse>
				<verse number="21">There were about five thousand men who were fed, in addition to many women and children!</verse>
				<verse number="22">As soon as the people were fed, Jesus told his disciples to get into their boat and to go to the other side of the lake while he stayed behind to dismiss the people.</verse>
				<verse number="23">After the crowds dispersed, Jesus went up into the hills to pray. And as night fell he was there praying alone.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But the disciples, who were now in the middle of the lake, ran into trouble, for their boat was tossed about by the high winds and heavy seas.</verse>
				<verse number="25">At about four o’clock in the morning, Jesus came to them, walking on the waves!</verse>
				<verse number="26">When the disciples saw him walking on top of the water, they were terrified and screamed, “A ghost!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then Jesus said, “Be brave and don’t be afraid. I am here!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Peter shouted out, “Lord, if it’s really you, then have me join you on the water!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Come and join me,” Jesus replied. So Peter stepped out onto the water and began to walk toward Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But when he realized how high the waves were, he became frightened and started to sink. “Save me, Lord!” he cried out.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Jesus immediately stretched out his hand and lifted him up and said, “What little faith you have! Why would you let doubt win?”</verse>
				<verse number="32">And the very moment they both stepped into the boat, the raging wind ceased.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then all the disciples bowed down before him and worshiped Jesus. They said in adoration, “You are truly the Son of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">After they crossed over and landed at Gennesaret,</verse>
				<verse number="35">the people living there quickly recognized who he was. They were quick to spread the news throughout the surrounding region that Jesus had come to them.</verse>
				<verse number="36">So they brought him all their sick, begging him to let them touch the fringe of his cloak. And everyone who touched it was instantly healed!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Then the Pharisees and religious scholars came from Jerusalem and asked Jesus this question:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Why do your disciples ignore the traditions of our elders? For example, they don’t ceremonially wash their hands before they eat bread.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus answered, “And why do you ignore the commandment of God because of your traditions?</verse>
				<verse number="4">For didn’t God say, ‘Honor your father and mother,’ and, ‘Whoever abuses or insults his father or mother must be put to death?’</verse>
				<verse number="5">“But you teach that it’s permissible to say to your parents when they are in financial need, ‘Whatever gift you would have received from me I can keep for myself, since I dedicated it as an offering to God.’</verse>
				<verse number="6">This doesn’t honor your father or mother. And you have elevated your tradition above the words of God.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Frauds and hypocrites! Isaiah described you perfectly when he said:</verse>
				<verse number="8">These people honor me only with their words, for their hearts are so very distant from me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They pretend to worship me, but their worship is nothing more than the empty traditions of men.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Jesus turned to the crowd and said, “Come, listen and open your heart to understand.</verse>
				<verse number="11">What truly contaminates a person is not what he puts into his mouth but what comes out of his mouth. That’s what makes people defiled.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then his disciples approached him and said, “Don’t you know that what you just said offended the Pharisees?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Jesus replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father didn’t plant is destined to be uprooted.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Stay away from them, for they’re nothing more than blind guides. Do you know what happens when a blind man pretends to guide another blind man? They both stumble into a ditch!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Peter spoke up and said, “Will you explain to us what you mean by your parable?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Jesus said, “Even after all that I’ve taught you, you still remain clueless?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Is it hard to understand that whatever you eat enters the stomach only to pass out into the sewer?</verse>
				<verse number="18">But what comes out of your mouth reveals the core of your heart. Words can pollute, not food.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You will find living within an impure heart evil ideas, murderous thoughts, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, lies, and slander.</verse>
				<verse number="20">That’s what pollutes a person. Eating with unwashed hands doesn’t defile anyone.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then Jesus left and went north into the non-Jewish region of Lebanon.</verse>
				<verse number="22">He encountered there a Canaanite woman who shouted out to him, “Lord, Son of David, show mercy to me! My daughter is horribly afflicted by a demon that torments her.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">But Jesus never answered her. So his disciples said to him, “Why do you ignore this woman who is crying out to us?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Jesus said, “I’ve only been sent to the lost sheep of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">But she came and bowed down before him and said, “Lord, help me!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Jesus responded, “It’s not right for a man to take bread from his children and throw it out to the dogs.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">“You’re right, Lord,” she replied. “But even puppies get to eat the crumbs that fall from the prince’s table.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then Jesus answered her, “Dear woman, your faith is strong! What you desire will be done for you.” And at that very moment, her daughter was instantly set free from demonic torment.</verse>
				<verse number="29">After leaving Lebanon, Jesus went to Lake Galilee and climbed a hill nearby and sat down.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then huge crowds of people streamed up the hill, bringing with them the lame, blind, deformed, mute, and many others in need of healing. They laid them at Jesus’ feet and he healed them all.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And the crowds marveled with amazement, astounded over the things they were witnessing with their own eyes! The lame were walking, the mute were speaking, the crippled were made well, and the blind could see. For three days everyone celebrated the miracles as they exalted and praised the God of Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="32">Jesus called his disciples to himself and said, “I care deeply about all these people, for they’ve already been with me for three days without food. I don’t want to send them away fasting or else they may be overcome by weakness on their journey home.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">The disciples said to him, “Where in the world are we going to find enough food in this desolate place to feed this crowd?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">“How many barley loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">So he gave the order, “Have the people sit down on the grass.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then he took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks to God. He broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, who then distributed the food to the crowds.</verse>
				<verse number="37">When everyone was full and satisfied, they gathered up the leftovers. And from what was once seven loaves and a few fish, they filled seven baskets!</verse>
				<verse number="38">There were four thousand men who ate the food Jesus multiplied, and even more including the women and children!</verse>
				<verse number="39">After dismissing the crowd, Jesus got into the boat and crossed over to the region of Magdala.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">One day some of the Pharisees and those of the Jewish sect known as the Sadducees approached Jesus, insisting that he prove to them that he was the Messiah. “Show us a supernatural sign from heaven,” they demanded.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Jesus answered, “You can read the signs of the weather, for you say, ‘Red sky at night, sailors delight.’</verse>
				<verse number="3">And, ‘Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning.’ You’re so adept at forecasting the weather by looking at the sky, but you’re absolutely clueless in reading the obvious signs of the times.</verse>
				<verse number="4">A wicked and wayward generation always asks for signs, but the only sign I provide for you will be the sign of Jonah the prophet.” Then he turned away and left them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Later, as Jesus and his disciples crossed over to the other side of Lake Galilee, the disciples realized they had forgotten to bring any loaves of bread.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus spoke up and said, “Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Thinking Jesus was scolding them over not bringing bread, they began to discuss it among themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, “You have such little faith! Why are you arguing with one another about having no bread?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Are you so slow to understand? Have you forgotten the miracle of feeding the five thousand families and how each of you ended up with a basket full of fragments?</verse>
				<verse number="10">And how seven loaves of bread fed four thousand families with baskets left over?</verse>
				<verse number="11">Don’t you understand? I’m not talking about bread, but I’m warning you to avoid the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then finally they realized he wasn’t talking about yeast found in bread, but the error of the teachings of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When Jesus came to Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples this question: “What are the people saying about me, the Son of Man? Who do they believe I am?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">They answered, “Some are convinced you are John the Baptizer, others say you are Elijah reincarnated, or Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“But you—who do you say that I am?” Jesus asked.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Simon Peter spoke up and said, “You are the Anointed One, the Son of the living God!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus replied, “You are favored and privileged Simeon, son of Jonah! For you didn’t discover this on your own, but my Father in heaven has supernaturally revealed it to you.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I give you the name Peter, a stone. And this rock will be the bedrock foundation on which I will build my church— my legislative assembly, and the power of death will not be able to overpower it!</verse>
				<verse number="19">I will give you the keys of heaven’s kingdom realm to forbid on earth that which is forbidden in heaven, and to release on earth that which is released in heaven.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">He then gave his disciples strict orders not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="21">From then on Jesus began to clearly reveal to his disciples that he was destined to go to Jerusalem and suffer injustice from the elders, leading priests, and religious scholars. He also explained that he would be killed and three days later be raised to life again.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Peter took him aside to correct him privately. He reprimanded Jesus over and over, saying to him, “God forbid, Master! Spare yourself. You must never let this happen to you!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus turned to Peter and said, “Get out of my way, you Satan! You are a hindrance to me, because your thoughts are only filled with man’s viewpoints and not with the ways of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If you truly want to follow me, you should at once completely reject and disown your own life. And you must be willing to share my cross and experience it as your own, as you continually surrender to my ways.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For if you choose self-sacrifice and lose your lives for my glory, you will continually discover true life. But if you choose to keep your lives for yourselves, you will forfeit what you try to keep.</verse>
				<verse number="26">For even if you were to gain all the wealth and power of this world—at the cost of your own life—what good would that be? And what could be more valuable to you than your own soul?</verse>
				<verse number="27">I, the Son of Man, will one day return with my messengers and in the splendor and majesty of my Father. And then I will reward each person according to what they have done.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But I promise you, there are some standing here now who won’t experience death until they have witnessed the coming of the Son of Man in the presence and the power of the kingdom realm of God!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">Six days later Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John, and hiked up a high mountain to be alone.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then Jesus’ appearance was dramatically altered. A radiant light as bright as the sun poured from his face. And his clothing became luminescent—dazzling like lightning. He was transfigured before their very eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared, and they spoke with Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Peter blurted out, “Lord, it’s so wonderful that we are all here together! If you want, I’ll construct three shrines, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But while Peter was still speaking, a bright radiant cloud spread over them, enveloping them all. And God’s voice suddenly spoke from the cloud, saying, “This is my dearly loved Son, the constant focus of my delight. Listen to him!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">The three disciples were dazed and terrified by this phenomenon, and they fell facedown to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But Jesus walked over and touched them, saying, “Get up and stop being afraid.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">When they finally opened their eyes and looked around, they saw no one else there but Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="9">As they all hiked down the mountain together, Jesus ordered them, “Don’t tell anyone of the divine appearance you just witnessed. Wait until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">His disciples asked him, “Why do all the religious scholars insist that Elijah must first appear before the Anointed One comes?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">He answered them, “They’re right. Elijah must come first and restore all things.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But Elijah has already appeared. And yet they didn’t recognize him, so they did to him whatever they pleased. And the Son of Man is destined to suffer the same abuse as what they did to him.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then the disciples realized that Jesus was referring to John the Baptizer all along.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They came to where a large crowd had gathered to wait for Jesus. A man came and knelt before him</verse>
				<verse number="15">and said, “Lord, please show your tender mercy toward my son. He has a demon who afflicts him. He has epilepsy, and he suffers horribly from seizures. He often falls into the cooking fire or into the river.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I brought him to your followers, but they weren’t able to heal him.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus replied, “Where is your faith? Can’t you see how wayward and wrong this generation is? How much longer do I stay with you and put up with your doubts? Bring your son to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the boy was instantly healed!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Later the disciples came to him privately and asked, “Why couldn’t we cast out the demon?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">He told them, “It was because of your lack of faith. I promise you, if you have faith inside of you no bigger than the size of a small mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move away from here and go over there,’ and you will see it move! There is nothing you couldn’t do!</verse>
				<verse number="21">But this kind is cast out only through prayer and fasting.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">When they all gathered together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be betrayed and turned over to his enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="23">They will kill him and in three days he will be resurrected.” When the disciples heard these words they were devastated.</verse>
				<verse number="24">After they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax approached Peter and asked, “Does your teacher pay the tax for the upkeep of the temple, like the rest of us?”</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Of course he does,” Peter answered. When Peter walked into the house, and before he had a chance to speak, Jesus spoke up and said, “Peter, I have a question for you. Who pays tolls or taxes to a king? Is tax collected from the king’s own children, or from his subjects?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">“From his subjects,” Peter answered. Jesus replied, “That’s right. The children get off free without paying taxes.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But so that we don’t offend them, go to the lake and throw out your hook, and the first fish that rises up will have a coin in its mouth. It will be the exact amount you need to pay the temple tax for both of us.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">At that time the disciples came to ask Jesus, “Who is considered to be the greatest in heaven’s kingdom realm?”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Jesus called a little one to his side and said to them,</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Learn this well: Unless you dramatically change your way of thinking and become teachable like a little child, you will never be able to enter in.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Whoever continually humbles himself to become like this little child is the greatest one in heaven’s kingdom realm.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And if you tenderly care for this little one on my behalf, you are tenderly caring for me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But if anyone abuses one of these little ones who believes in me, it would be better for him to have a heavy boulder tied around his neck and be hurled into the deepest sea than to face the punishment he deserves!</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Misery will come to the one who lures people away into sin. Troubles and obstacles to your faith are inevitable, but great devastation will come to the one guilty of causing others to stumble!</verse>
				<verse number="8">If your hand clings to sin, cut it off and throw it away. If your foot continually steps onto sin’s path, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better for you to enter into heaven crippled and maimed than to have both hands and both feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And if your eye is always focusing on sin, pluck it out and throw it away. For it is better for you to enter into heaven with one eye than to be thrown into hell fire with two.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Be careful that you not corrupt one of these little ones. For I can assure you that in heaven each of their guardian angels always sees the face of my heavenly Father.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">“The Son of Man has come to give life to all who are lost.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Think of it this way: If a man owns a hundred sheep and one lamb wanders away and is lost, won’t he leave the ninety-nine grazing the hillside and thoroughly search for the one lost lamb?</verse>
				<verse number="13">And if he finds his lost lamb, he rejoices over it, more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now you should understand that it is never the desire of your heavenly Father that a single one of these little ones should be lost.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“If your fellow believer sins against you, you must go to that one privately and attempt to resolve the matter. If he responds, your relationship is restored.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But if his heart is closed to you, then go to him again, taking one or two others with you. You’ll be fulfilling what the Scripture teaches when it says, ‘Every word may be verified by the testimony of two or three witnesses.’</verse>
				<verse number="17">And if he refuses to listen, then share the issue with the congregation in hopes of restoration. If he still refuses to respond, even to the church, then you must disregard him as though he were an outsider, on the same level as an unrepentant sinner.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Receive this truth: Whatever you forbid on earth will be considered to be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be considered to be released in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Again, I give you an eternal truth: If two of you agree to ask God for something in a symphony of prayer, my heavenly Father will do it for you.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For wherever two or three come together in honor of my name, I am right there with them!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Later Peter approached Jesus and said, “How many times do I have to forgive my fellow believer who keeps offending me? Seven times?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Jesus answered, “Not seven times, Peter, but seventy times seven times!</verse>
				<verse number="23">The lessons of forgiveness in heaven’s kingdom realm can be illustrated like this: “There once was a king who had servants who had borrowed money from the royal treasury. He decided to settle accounts with each of them.</verse>
				<verse number="24">As he began the process, it came to his attention that one of his servants owed him one billion dollars. So he summoned the servant before him and said to him, ‘Pay me what you owe me.’</verse>
				<verse number="25">When his servant was unable to repay his debt, the king ordered that he be sold as a slave along with his wife and children and every possession they owned as payment toward his debt.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The servant threw himself facedown at his master’s feet and begged for mercy. ‘Please be patient with me. Just give me more time and I will repay you all that I owe.’</verse>
				<verse number="27">Upon hearing his pleas, the king had compassion on his servant, and released him, and forgave his entire debt.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“No sooner had the servant left when he met one of his fellow servants, who owed him twenty thousand dollars He seized him by the throat and began to choke him, saying, ‘You’d better pay me right now everything you owe me!’</verse>
				<verse number="29">His fellow servant threw himself facedown at his feet and begged, ‘Please be patient with me. If you’ll just give me time, I will repay you all that is owed.’</verse>
				<verse number="30">But the one who had his debt forgiven stubbornly refused to forgive what was owed him. He had his fellow servant thrown into prison and demanded he remain there until he repaid the debt in full.</verse>
				<verse number="31">“When his associates saw what was going on, they were outraged and went to the king and told him the whole story.</verse>
				<verse number="32">The king said to him, ‘You scoundrel! Is this the way you respond to my mercy? Because you begged me, I forgave you the massive debt that you owed me.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Why didn’t you show the same mercy to your fellow servant that I showed to you?’</verse>
				<verse number="34">In a fury of anger, the king turned him over to the prison guards to be tortured until all his debt was repaid.</verse>
				<verse number="35">In this same way, my heavenly Father will deal with any of you if you do not release forgiveness from your heart toward your fellow believer.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">After Jesus finished teaching them, he left Galilee and made his way toward the district of Judea, east of the Jordan River.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Massive crowds followed him and he healed all who were sick.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The Pharisees were intent on putting Jesus to the test with difficult questions, so they approached him and asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Haven’t you read the Scriptures about creation?” Jesus replied. “The Creator made us male and female from the very beginning,</verse>
				<verse number="5">and ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and live with his wife. And the two will become one flesh.’</verse>
				<verse number="6">From then on, they are no longer two, but united as one. So what God unites let no one divide!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">They responded, “So then why did Moses command us to give a certificate of divorce and it would be lawful?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus said, “Moses permitted you to divorce because your hearts are so hard and stubborn, but originally there was no such thing.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But I say to you, whoever leaves his wife for any reason other than immorality, then takes another wife is living in adultery. And whoever takes a divorced woman in marriage is also living in adultery.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">His disciples spoke up and said, “If this is the standard, then it seems better to never get married.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Not everyone is meant to remain single—only those whom God gives grace to be unmarried.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For some are born to celibacy; others have been made eunuchs by others. And there are some who have chosen to live in celibacy for the sacred purpose of heaven’s kingdom realm. Let those who can, accept this truth for themselves.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then they brought little children to Jesus so that he would lay his hands on them, bless them, and pray for them. But the disciples scolded those who brought the children, saying, “Don’t bother him with this now!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Jesus overheard them and said, “I want little children to come to me, so never interfere with them when they want to come, for heaven’s kingdom realm is composed of beloved ones like these! Listen to this truth: No one will enter the kingdom realm of heaven unless he becomes like one of these!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then he laid his hands on each of them and went on his way.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then a young man approached Jesus and bowed before him, saying, “Wonderful teacher —is there a good work I have to do to obtain eternal life?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus answered, “Why would you call me wonderful? God alone is wonderful. And why would you ask what good work you need to do? Keep the commandments and you’ll enter into the life of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Which ones?” he asked. Jesus said, “Don’t murder, don’t commit adultery, don’t steal, don’t lie,</verse>
				<verse number="19">honor your father and mother, and love those around you as you love yourself.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">“But I’ve always obeyed every one of them without fail,” the young man replied. “What else do I lack?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus said to him, “If you really want to be perfect, go now and sell everything you own. Give your money to the poor and your treasure will be transferred into heaven. Then come back and follow me for the rest of your life.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">When the young man heard these words, he walked away sad, for he had great wealth.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said, “Listen. Do you understand how difficult it is for the rich to enter into heaven’s kingdom realm?</verse>
				<verse number="24">In fact, it’s easier to stuff a heavy rope through the eye of a needle than it is for the wealthy to enter into God’s kingdom realm!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Stunned and bewildered, his disciples asked, “Then who in the world can possibly be saved?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Looking into their eyes, Jesus replied, “Humanly speaking, no one, because no one can save himself. But what seems impossible to you is never impossible to God!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then Peter blurted out, “Here we are. We’ve given up everything to follow you. What reward will there be for us?”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Jesus responded, “Listen to the truth: In the age of the restoration of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will have twelve thrones of your own, and you will govern the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For anyone who has left behind their home and property, leaving family—brothers or sisters, mothers or fathers, or children—for my sake, they will be repaid a hundred times over and will inherit eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But many who push themselves to be first will find themselves last. And those who are willing to be last will find themselves to be first.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">“This will help you understand the way heaven’s kingdom operates: “There once was a wealthy landowner who went out at daybreak to hire all the laborers he could find to work in his vineyard.</verse>
				<verse number="2">After agreeing to pay them the standard day’s wage, he put them to work.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then at nine o’clock, as he was passing through the town square, he found others standing around without work.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He told them, ‘Come and work for me in my vineyard and I’ll pay you a fair wage.’</verse>
				<verse number="5">So off they went to join the others. He did the same thing at noon and again at three o’clock, making the same arrangement as he did with the others.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Hoping to finish his harvest that day, he went to the town square again at five o’clock and found more who were idle. So he said to them, ‘Why have you been here all day without work?’</verse>
				<verse number="7">“ ‘Because no one hired us,’ they answered. “So he said to them, ‘Then go and join my crew and work in my vineyard.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">“When evening came, the owner of the vineyard went to his foreman and said, ‘Call in all the laborers, line them up, and pay them the same wages, starting with the most recent ones I hired and finishing with the ones who worked all day.’</verse>
				<verse number="9">“When those hired late in the day came to be paid, they were given a full day’s wage.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And when those who had been hired first came to be paid, they were convinced that they would receive more. But everyone was paid the standard wage.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When they realized what had happened, they were offended and complained to the landowner, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="12">‘You’re treating us unfairly! They’ve only worked for one hour while we’ve labored and sweated all day under the scorching sun. You’ve made them equal to us!’</verse>
				<verse number="13">“The landowner replied, ‘Friends, I’m not being unfair—I’m doing exactly what I said. Didn’t you agree to work for the standard wage?</verse>
				<verse number="14">If I want to give those who only worked for an hour equal pay, what does that matter to you?</verse>
				<verse number="15">Don’t I have the right to do what I want with what is mine? Why should my generosity make you jealous of them?’</verse>
				<verse number="16">“ Now you can understand what I meant when I said that the first will end up last and the last will end up being first. Everyone is invited, but few are the chosen.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus was about to go to Jerusalem, so he took his twelve disciples aside privately and said to them,</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Listen to me. We’re on our way to Jerusalem, and I need to remind you that the Son of Man will be handed over to the religious leaders and scholars, and they will sentence him to be executed.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And they will hand him over to the Romans to be mocked, tortured, and crucified. Yet three days later he will be raised to life again.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">The wife of Zebedee approached Jesus with her sons, Jacob and John. She knelt before him and asked him for a favor.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He said to her, “What is it that you want?” She answered, “Make the decree that these, my sons, will rule with you in your kingdom—one sitting on your right hand, one on your left.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Jesus replied, “You don’t know what you are asking.” Then, looking in the eyes of Jacob and John, Jesus said, “Are you prepared to drink from the cup of suffering that I am about to drink? And are you able to endure the baptism into death that I am about to endure?” They answered him, “Yes, we are able.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">“You will indeed drink the cup of my suffering and be immersed into my death,” Jesus told them. “But to be the ones who sit at the place of highest honor is not mine to decide. My Father is the one who chooses them and prepares them.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">The other ten disciples were listening to all of this, and a jealous anger arose among them against the two brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus, knowing their thoughts, called them to his side and said, “Kings and those with great authority in this world rule oppressively over their subjects, like tyrants.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But this is not your calling. You will lead by a completely different model. The greatest one among you will live as the one who is called to serve others,</verse>
				<verse number="27">because the greatest honor and authority is reserved for the one with the heart of a servant.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For even the Son of Man did not come expecting to be served but to serve and give his life in exchange for the salvation of many.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">As Jesus left Jericho a huge crowd gathered and followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And there were two blind men sitting on the roadside. When they heard that it was Jesus passing by, they shouted, “Son of David, show us mercy, Lord!”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Those in the crowd scolded them and told them to be quiet. But the blind men shouted even louder, “Jesus, Son of David, show us mercy, Lord!”</verse>
				<verse number="32">So Jesus stopped and had them brought to him. He asked them, “What do you want me to do for you?”</verse>
				<verse number="33">They said, “Lord, we want to see! Heal us!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus was deeply moved with compassion toward them. So he touched their eyes, and instantly they could see! Jesus said to them, “Your faith has healed you.” And all the people praised God because of this miracle. And the two men became his followers from that day onward.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">Now, as they were approaching Jerusalem they arrived at the place of the stables near the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“As soon as you enter the village, you will find a donkey tethered along with her young colt. Untie them both and bring them to me.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And if anyone stops you and asks, ‘What are you doing?’ just tell them, ‘The Lord of All needs them,’ and he will let you take them.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">All of this happened to fulfill the prophecy:</verse>
				<verse number="5">Tell Zion’s daughter: “Look, your King arrives! He’s coming to you humbly, sitting on a donkey, riding on a donkey’s colt.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So the two disciples went on ahead and did as Jesus had instructed them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They brought the donkey and her colt to him and placed their cloaks and prayer shawls on the colt, and Jesus rode on it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then an exceptionally large crowd gathered and carpeted the road before him with their cloaks and prayer shawls. Others cut down branches from trees to spread in his path.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus rode in the center of the procession—crowds going before him and crowds coming behind him, and they all shouted, “Bring the victory, Lord, Son of David! He is the blessed one sent from the Lord Yahweh! We celebrate with praises to God in the highest!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">As Jesus entered Jerusalem, the people went wild with excitement—the entire city was thrown into an uproar!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Some asked, “Who is this man?” And the crowds shouted back, “This is Jesus! He’s the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Upon entering Jerusalem Jesus went directly into the temple area and drove away all the merchants who were buying and selling their goods. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the stands of those selling doves.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And he said to them, “My dwelling place will be known as a house of prayer, but you have made it into a hangout for thieves!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then the blind and the crippled came into the temple courts, and Jesus healed them all. And the children circled around him shouting out, “Blessings and praises to the Son of David!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">But when the chief priests and religious scholars heard the children shouting and saw all the wonderful miracles of healing, they were furious.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They said to Jesus, “Don’t you hear what these children are saying? This is not right!” Jesus answered, “Yes, I hear them. But have you never read the Scripture, ‘From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise’?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus then left at once for the nearby village of Bethany, where he spent the night.</verse>
				<verse number="18">While walking back into the city the next morning, he got hungry.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He noticed a lone fig tree by the side of the path and walked over to see if there was any fruit on it, but there was none—he found only leaves. So he spoke to the fig tree and said, “You will be barren and will never bear fruit again!” Instantly the fig tree shriveled up right in front of their eyes!</verse>
				<verse number="20">Astonished, his disciples asked, “How did you make this fig tree instantly wither and die?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus replied, “Listen to the truth. If you do not doubt God’s power and speak out of faith’s fullness, you can also speak to a tree and it will wither away. Even more than that, you could say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and be thrown into the sea’ and it will be done.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Everything you pray for with the fullness of faith you will receive!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">After this Jesus went into the temple courts and taught the people. The leading priests and Jewish elders approached him and interrupted him and asked, “By what power do you do these things, and who granted you the authority to teach here?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Jesus answered them, “I too have a question to ask you. If you can answer this question, then I will tell you by what power I do these things.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Where did John’s authority to baptize come from? From heaven or from people?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">They stepped away and debated among themselves, saying, “How should we answer this? If we say from heaven, he will say to us, ‘Then why didn’t you respond to John and believe what he said?’ But if we deny that God gave John his authority, we’ll be mobbed by the people, for they’re convinced that John was God’s prophet.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">So they finally answered, “We don’t know.” “Then neither will I tell you from where my power comes to do these things!” he replied.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Jesus said to his critics, “Tell me what you think of this parable: “There once was a man with two sons. The father came to the first and said, ‘Son, I want you to go and work in the vineyard today.’</verse>
				<verse number="29">The son replied, ‘I’d rather not.’ But afterward, he deeply regretted what he said to his father, changed his mind, and decided to go to the vineyard.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The father approached the second son and said the same thing to him. The son replied, ‘Father, I will go and do as you said.’ But he never did—he didn’t go to the vineyard.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Tell me now, which of these two sons did the will of his father?” They answered him, “The first one.” Jesus said, “You’re right. For many sinners, tax collectors, and prostitutes are going into God’s kingdom realm ahead of you!</verse>
				<verse number="32">John came to show you the path of righteousness, yet the despised and outcasts believed in him, but you did not. When you saw them turn, you neither repented of your ways nor believed his words.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">“Pay close attention to this parable,” Jesus said. “There once was an honorable man who planted a vineyard. He built a fence around it, dug out a pit for pressing the grapes, and erected a watchtower. Afterward he leased the land to tenant farmers and then went a distance away.</verse>
				<verse number="34">At harvest time he sent his servants to the tenants to collect the portion that was due him as the lord of the vineyard.</verse>
				<verse number="35">But the tenants seized his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another.</verse>
				<verse number="36">So the landowner sent other servants, even more than at first, but they were mistreated the same way.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Finally, he sent his own son to them, and he said to himself, ‘Perhaps with my own son standing before them they will be ashamed of what they’ve done.’</verse>
				<verse number="38">But when the tenants saw the son, they said, ‘This is the heir! Let’s kill him and then we can have his inheritance!’</verse>
				<verse number="39">So they seized him, took him outside the vineyard, and murdered him.</verse>
				<verse number="40">“You tell me, when the lord of the vineyard comes, what do you think he will do to those tenants?”</verse>
				<verse number="41">They answered, “He will bring a horrible death to those who did this evil and he will completely destroy them. Then he’ll lease his vineyard to different tenants who will be faithful to give him the portion he deserves.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">Jesus said to them, “Haven’t you ever read the Scripture that says: The very stone the builder rejected as flawed has now become the most important cornerstone. This was the Lord’s plan — isn’t it marvelous to behold?</verse>
				<verse number="43">“This is why I say to you that the kingdom realm of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="44">The one who comes against this stone will be broken, but the one on whom it falls will be pulverized!”</verse>
				<verse number="45">When the leading priests and the Pharisees realized that the parable was referring to them, they were</verse>
				<verse number="46">outraged and wanted to arrest him at once. But they were afraid of the reaction of the crowds, because the people considered him to be a prophet.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">As was his custom, Jesus continued to teach the people by using allegories.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He illustrated the reality of heaven’s kingdom realm by saying, “There once was a king who arranged an extravagant wedding feast for his son.</verse>
				<verse number="3">On the day the festivities were set to begin, he sent his servants to summon all the invited guests, but they chose not to come.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So the king sent even more servants to inform the invited guests, saying, ‘Come, for the sumptuous feast is now ready! The oxen and fattened cattle have been killed and everything is prepared, so come! Come to the wedding feast for my son and his bride!’</verse>
				<verse number="5">“But the invited guests were not impressed. One was preoccupied with his business; another went off to his farming enterprise.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And the rest seized the king’s messengers and shamefully mistreated them, and even killed them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">This infuriated the king! So he sent his soldiers to execute those murderers and had their city burned to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Then the king said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, yet those who had been invited to attend didn’t deserve the honor.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now I want you to go into the streets and alleyways and invite anyone and everyone you find to come and enjoy the wedding feast in honor of my son.’</verse>
				<verse number="10">“So the servants went out into the city streets and invited everyone to come to the wedding feast, good and bad alike, until the banquet hall was crammed with people!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now, when the king entered the banquet hall, he looked with glee over all his guests. But then he noticed a guest who was not wearing the wedding robe provided for him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So he said, ‘My friend, how is it that you’re here and you’re not wearing your wedding garment?’ But the man was speechless.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Then the king turned to his servants and said, ‘Tie him up and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be great sorrow, with weeping and grinding of teeth.’</verse>
				<verse number="14">For everyone is invited to enter in, but few respond in excellence.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the Pharisees came together to make a plan to entrap Jesus with his own words.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So they sent some of their disciples together with some staunch supporters of Herod. They said to Jesus, “Teacher, we know that you’re an honest man of integrity and you teach us the truth of God’s ways. We can clearly see that you’re not one who speaks only to win the people’s favor, because you speak the truth without regard to the consequences.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So tell us, then, what you think. Is it proper for us Jews to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Jesus knew the malice that was hidden behind their cunning ploy and said, “Why are you testing me, you imposters who think you have all the answers?</verse>
				<verse number="19">Show me one of the Roman coins.” So they brought him a silver coin used to pay the tax.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Now, tell me, whose head is on this coin and whose inscription is stamped on it?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Caesar’s,” they replied. Jesus said, “Precisely, for the coin bears the image of the emperor Caesar. Well, then, you should pay the emperor what is due to the emperor. But because you bear the image of God, give back to God all that belongs to him.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">The imposters were baffled in the presence of all the people. When they realized once again that they were unable to trap Jesus, they went away stunned.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Some of the Sadducees, a religious group that denied there was a resurrection of the dead, came to ask Jesus this question:</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Teacher, the law of Moses teaches that if a man dies before he has children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother’s family line.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now, there was a family with seven brothers. The oldest got married but soon died, leaving his widow for his brother.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The second brother married and also died, and the third also. This was repeated down to the seventh brother,</verse>
				<verse number="27">when finally the woman also died. So here’s our dilemma:</verse>
				<verse number="28">Which of the seven brothers will be the woman’s husband when she’s resurrected from the dead, since they all were once married to her?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus answered them, “You are deluded, because your hearts are not filled with the revelation of the Scriptures or the power of God.</verse>
				<verse number="30">For after the resurrection, men and women will not marry, just like the angels of heaven don’t marry.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Haven’t you read what God said:</verse>
				<verse number="32">‘I am the Living God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">When the crowds heard this they were dazed and astonished over his teaching!</verse>
				<verse number="34">When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they called a meeting to discuss how to trap Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then one of them, a religious scholar, posed this question to test him:</verse>
				<verse number="36">“Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Jesus answered him, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with every passion of your heart, with all the energy of your being, and with every thought that is within you.’</verse>
				<verse number="38">This is the great and supreme commandment.</verse>
				<verse number="39">And the second is like it in importance: ‘You must love your friend in the same way you love yourself.’</verse>
				<verse number="40">Contained within these commandments to love you will find all the meaning of the Law and the Prophets.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">While all the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus took the opportunity to pose a question of his own:</verse>
				<verse number="42">“What do you think about the Anointed One? Whose son is he?” “The son of David,” they replied.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Then Jesus said to them, “How is it that David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, could call his son the Lord? For didn’t he say:</verse>
				<verse number="44">The Lord said to my Lord, ‘Sit beside me in the place of authority until I subdue all your enemies under your feet’?</verse>
				<verse number="45">“So how could David call his own son ‘the Lord’?”</verse>
				<verse number="46">No one could come up with an answer. And from that day on none of the Pharisees had the courage to question Jesus any longer.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="23">
				<verse number="1">Then Jesus addressed both the crowds and his disciples and said,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“The religious scholars and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat as the authorized interpreters of the Law.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So listen and follow what they teach, but don’t do what they do, for they tell you one thing and do another.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They tie on your backs an oppressive burden of religious obligations and insist that you carry them, but will never lift a finger to help ease your load.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Everything they do is done for show and to be noticed by others. They want to be seen as holy, so they wear oversized prayer boxes on their arms and foreheads with Scriptures inside, and wear extra-long tassels on their outer garments.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They crave the seats of highest honor at banquets and in their meeting places.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And how they love to be admired by men with their titles of respect, aspiring to be recognized in public and have others call them ‘Reverend.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">“But you are to be different from that. You are not to be called ‘master,’ for you have only one Master, and you are all brothers and sisters.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And you are not to be addressed as ‘father,’ for you have one Father, who is in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Nor are you to be addressed as ‘teacher,’ for you have one Teacher, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The greatest among you will be the one who always serves others.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Remember this: If you have a lofty opinion of yourself and seek to be honored, you will be humbled. But if you have a modest opinion of yourself and choose to humble yourself, you will be honored.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and you Pharisees—such frauds and pretenders! You do all you can to keep people from experiencing the reality of heaven’s kingdom realm. Not only do you refuse to enter in, you also forbid anyone else from entering in!</verse>
				<verse number="14">“ Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and you Pharisees—frauds and pretenders! For you eat up the widow’s household with the ladle of your prayers. Because of this, you will receive a greater judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and you Pharisees—such frauds and pretenders! For you will travel over land and sea to find one disciple, only to make him twice the child of hell as yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“You blind guides! Great sorrow awaits you, for you teach that there’s nothing binding when you swear by God’s temple, but if you swear by the gold of the temple, you are bound by your oath.</verse>
				<verse number="17">You are deceived and blind! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred?</verse>
				<verse number="18">And you say that whoever takes an oath by swearing, ‘By the altar,’ it is nothing. But if you swear, ‘By the gift upon the altar,’ then you are obligated to keep your oath.</verse>
				<verse number="19">What deception! For what is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?</verse>
				<verse number="20">Whoever swears by the altar swears by the altar and everything offered on it.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and the one who dwells in it.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by God, who sits upon it.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and Pharisees—frauds and pretenders! For you are obsessed with peripheral issues, like insisting on paying meticulous tithes on the smallest herbs that grow in your gardens. These matters are fine, yet you ignore the most important duties of all: to walk in the love of God, to display mercy to others, and to live with integrity. Readjust your values and place first things first.</verse>
				<verse number="24">What blind guides! Nitpickers! You will spoon out a gnat from your drink, yet at the same time you’ve gulped down a camel without realizing it!</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and Pharisees—frauds and imposters! You are like one who will only wipe clean the outside of a cup or bowl, leaving the inside filthy. You are foolish to ignore the greed and self-indulgence that live like germs within you.</verse>
				<verse number="26">You are blind to your evil. Shouldn’t the one who cleans the outside also be concerned with cleaning the inside? You need to have more than clean dishes; you need clean hearts!</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and Pharisees—frauds and imposters! You are nothing more than tombs painted over with white paint—tombs that look shining and beautiful on the outside but filled with rotting corpses on the inside.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Outwardly you masquerade as righteous people, but inside your hearts you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and Pharisees—frauds and imposters! You build memorials for the prophets your ancestors killed and decorate the monuments of the godly people your ancestors murdered.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then you boast, ‘If we had lived back then, we would not have joined them in killing the prophets.’</verse>
				<verse number="31">But your words and deeds testify that you are just like them and prove that you are indeed the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Go ahead and finish what your ancestors started!</verse>
				<verse number="33">You are nothing but snakes in the grass, the offspring of poisonous vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell if you refuse to turn in repentance?</verse>
				<verse number="34">“For this reason I will send you more prophets and wise men and teachers of truth. Some you will crucify, and some you will beat mercilessly with whips in your meeting houses, abusing and persecuting them from city to city.</verse>
				<verse number="35">As your penalty, you will be held responsible for the righteous blood spilled and the murders of every godly person throughout your history—from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Jehoiada, whom you killed as he stood in the temple between the brazen altar and the Holy Place.</verse>
				<verse number="36">I tell you the truth: the judgment for all these things will fall upon this generation!”</verse>
				<verse number="37">“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem—you are the city that murders your prophets! You are the city that stones the very messengers who were sent to deliver you! So many times I have longed to gather a wayward people, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings—but you were too stubborn to let me.</verse>
				<verse number="38">And now it is too late, since your city will be left in ruins.</verse>
				<verse number="39">For you will not see me again until you are able to say, ‘We welcome the one who comes to us in the name of the Lord.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="24">
				<verse number="1">As Jesus was leaving the temple courts, his disciples came to him and pointed out the beautiful architecture of the temple.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And Jesus turned to them and said, “Take a good look at all these things, for I’m telling you, there will not be one stone left upon another. It will all be leveled!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Later, when they arrived at the Mount of Olives, his disciples came privately to where he was sitting and said, “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what sign should we expect to signal your coming and the completion of this age?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus answered, “At that time deception will run rampant. So beware that you are not fooled!</verse>
				<verse number="5">For many will appear on the scene claiming my authority or saying about themselves, ‘I am the Anointed One,’ and they will lead many astray.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“You will hear of wars and revolutions on every side, with more rumors of wars to come. Don’t panic or give in to your fears, for the breaking apart of the world’s systems is destined to happen. But it won’t yet be the end; it will still be unfolding.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Nations will go to war against nations and kingdoms against kingdoms. And there will be terrible earthquakes, horrible epidemics, and famines in place after place.</verse>
				<verse number="8">This is how the birth pains of the new age will begin!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“You can expect to be persecuted, even killed; for you will be hated by all the nations because of your love for me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then many will stop following me and fall away, and they will betray one another and hate one another.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And many lying prophets will arise, deceiving multitudes and leading them away from the path of truth.</verse>
				<verse number="12">There will be such an increase of the sin of lawlessness that those whose hearts once burned with passion for God and others will grow cold.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But hold your hope firmly to the end and you will experience life and deliverance.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Yet through it all, the good news of heaven’s kingdom will be proclaimed all over the world, providing every nation with a demonstration of the reality of God. And after that the end of this age will arrive.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“When you witness what Daniel prophesied, ‘the disgusting destroyer,’ taking its stand in the Holy Place [let the reader learn],</verse>
				<verse number="16">then those in the land of Judah must escape to the higher ground.</verse>
				<verse number="17">On that day, if you happen to be outside, don’t go back inside to gather belongings.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And if you’re working out in the field, don’t run back home to get a coat.</verse>
				<verse number="19">It will be especially hard for pregnant women and for those nursing their babies in those days.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So pray that your escape will not be during the winter months or on a Sabbath.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For this will be a time of great misery beyond the magnitude of anything the world has ever seen or ever will see. Unless God limited those days, no one would escape.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But because of his love for those chosen to be his, he will shorten that time of trouble.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“And you will hear reports from some, saying, ‘Look, he has returned,’ ‘The Messiah is over here,’ or ‘The Messiah is over there!’ Don’t believe it.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For there will be imposters falsely claiming to be God’s ‘Anointed One,’ and false prophets will arise to perform miracle signs to lead astray, if possible, those God has chosen to be his.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Remember this, for I prophesy it will happen!</verse>
				<verse number="26">So if someone says to you, ‘Look, the Anointed One has returned! He’s in the desert,’ don’t go chasing after him. Or if they say to you, ‘Look, he’s here in our house,’ don’t believe it.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The appearing of the Son of Man will burst forth with the brightness of lightning shining from the eastern sky to the west.</verse>
				<verse number="28">How do birds of prey know where the dead body is? They just know instinctively, and so you will know when I appear.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Then immediately this is what will take place: ‘The sun will be darkened and the moon give no light. The stars will fall from the sky and all the cosmic powers will be shaken.’</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then the sign announcing the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn over him. And they will see the Son of Man appearing in the clouds of heaven, revealed with mighty power, great splendor, and glory.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And he will send his messengers with the loud blast of the trumpet, and with a great voice they will gather his beloved chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other!”</verse>
				<verse number="32">“Now learn the lesson from the parable of the fig tree. When spring arrives and it sends out its tender branches and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near.</verse>
				<verse number="33">So it will be with you, for when you observe all these things taking place, you will know that he is near, even at the door!</verse>
				<verse number="34">I assure you, the end of this age will not come until all I have spoken comes to pass.</verse>
				<verse number="35">The earth and sky will wear out and fade away before one word I speak loses its power or fails to accomplish its purpose.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">“Concerning that day and exact hour, no one knows when it will arrive, not even the angels of heaven —only the Father knows.</verse>
				<verse number="37">For it will be like it was in the days of Noah when the Son of Man appears.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Before the flood, people lived their lives eating, drinking, marrying, and having children.</verse>
				<verse number="39">They didn’t realize the end was near until Noah entered the ark, and then suddenly, the flood came and took them all away in judgment. It will happen the same way when the Son of Man appears.</verse>
				<verse number="40">At that time, two men will be working on the farm; one will be taken away in judgment, the other left.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Two women will be grinding grain; one will be taken away in judgment, the other left.</verse>
				<verse number="42">This is why you must stay alert: because no one knows the day your Lord will come.</verse>
				<verse number="43">“But realize this: If a homeowner had known what time of night the burglar would come to rob his house, he would have been alert and ready, and not let his house be robbed.</verse>
				<verse number="44">So always be ready, alert, and prepared, because at an hour when you’re not expecting him, the Son of Man will come.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">“What would qualify a servant to manage his master’s house? He would be a wise servant who is both faithful and dependable. The master would commission him to oversee others, for he would lead them well and give them food at the right time.</verse>
				<verse number="46">What joy and blessing will come to that faithful servant when the master comes home to find him serving with excellence!</verse>
				<verse number="47">I can promise you, the master will raise him up and put him in charge of all that he owns.</verse>
				<verse number="48">“But the evil servant says in his heart, ‘My master delays his coming, and who knows when he will return?’ And because of the delay, the servant mistreats those in his master’s household. Instead of caring for the ones he was appointed to serve,</verse>
				<verse number="49">he abuses the other servants and begins to party with drunkards.</verse>
				<verse number="50">Let me tell you what will happen to him. His master will suddenly return unexpectedly, and he will remove the abusive, selfish servant from his position of trust.</verse>
				<verse number="51">And the master will cut him in two and assign him to the place of great sorrow and anguish along with all the other hypocrites.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="25">
				<verse number="1">“When my coming draws near, heaven’s kingdom realm can be compared to ten maidens who took their oil lamps and went outside to meet the bridegroom and his bride.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Five of them were foolish and ill-prepared, for they took no extra oil for their lamps. Five of them were wise, for they took flasks of olive oil with their lamps.</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">When the bridegroom didn’t come when they expected, they all grew drowsy and fell asleep.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then suddenly, in the middle of the night, they were awakened by the shout ‘Get up! The bridegroom is here! Come out and have an encounter with him!’</verse>
				<verse number="7">So all the girls got up and trimmed their lamps.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But the foolish ones were running out of oil, so they said to the five wise ones, ‘Share your oil with us, because our lamps are going out!’</verse>
				<verse number="9">“ ‘We can’t,’ they replied. ‘We don’t have enough for all of us. You’ll have to go and buy some for yourselves!’</verse>
				<verse number="10">“While the five girls were out buying oil, the bridegroom appeared. Those who were ready and waiting were escorted inside with him and the wedding party to enjoy the feast. And then the door was locked.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Later, the five foolish girls came running up to the door and pleaded, ‘Lord, Lord, let us come in!’</verse>
				<verse number="12">“But he called back, ‘Go away! Do I know you? I can assure you, I don’t even know you!’</verse>
				<verse number="13">“That is the reason you should always stay awake and be alert, because you don’t know the day or the hour when the Bridegroom will appear.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Again, heaven’s kingdom is like a wealthy man who went on a long journey and summoned all his trusted servants and assigned his financial management over to them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Before he left on his journey, he entrusted a bag of five thousand gold coins to one of his servants, to another a bag of two thousand gold coins, and to the third a bag of one thousand gold coins, each according to his ability to manage.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“The one entrusted with five thousand gold coins immediately went out and traded with the money, and he doubled his investment.</verse>
				<verse number="17">In the same way, the one who was entrusted with two thousand gold coins traded with the sum and likewise doubled his investment.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But the one who had been entrusted with one thousand gold coins dug a hole in the ground and buried his master’s money.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“After much time had passed, the master returned to settle accounts with his servants.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The one who was entrusted with five thousand gold coins came and brought ten thousand, saying, ‘See, I have doubled your money.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Commending his servant, the master replied, ‘You have done well, and proven yourself to be my loyal and trustworthy servant. Because you have been a faithful steward to manage a small sum, now I will put you in charge of much, much more. You will experience the delight of your master, who will say to you, “Enter into the joy of your Lord!” ’</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Then the one who had been entrusted with two thousand gold coins came in and said, ‘See, my master, I have doubled what you have entrusted to me.’</verse>
				<verse number="23">“Commending his servant, the master replied, ‘You have done well, and proven yourself to be my loyal and trustworthy servant. Because you were faithful to manage a small sum, now I will put you in charge of much, much more. You will experience the delight of your master, who will say to you, “Enter into the joy of your Lord!” ’</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Then the one who had been entrusted with one thousand gold coins came to his master and said, ‘Look, sir. I know that you are a hard man to please and you’re a shrewd and ruthless businessman who grows rich on the backs of others.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your money and buried it in the ground. But here it is—take it, it’s yours.’</verse>
				<verse number="26">“But his master said to him, ‘You’re an untrustworthy and lazy servant! If you knew I was a shrewd and ruthless business man who always makes a profit, why didn’t you deposit my money in the bank?</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then I would have received it all back with interest when I returned.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But because you were unfaithful, I will take the one thousand gold coins and give them to the one who has ten thousand.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For the one who has will be given more, until he overflows with abundance. And the one with hardly anything, even what little he has will be taken from him.’</verse>
				<verse number="30">“Then the master said to his other servants, ‘Now, throw that good-for-nothing servant far away from me into the outer darkness, where there will be great misery and anguish!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="31">“When the Son of Man appears in his majestic glory, with all his angels by his side, he will take his seat on his throne of splendor,</verse>
				<verse number="32">and all the nations will be gathered together before him. And like a shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats, he will separate all the people.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The ‘sheep’ he will put on his right side and the ‘goats’ on his left.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then the King will turn to those on his right and say, ‘You have a special place in my Father’s heart. Come and experience the full inheritance of the kingdom realm that has been destined for you from before the foundation of the world!</verse>
				<verse number="35">For when you saw me hungry, you fed me. When you found me thirsty, you gave me drink. When I had no place to stay, you invited me in,</verse>
				<verse number="36">and when I was poorly clothed, you covered me. When I was sick, you tenderly cared for me, and when I was in prison you visited me.’</verse>
				<verse number="37">“Then the godly will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and give you food and something to drink?</verse>
				<verse number="38">When did we see you with no place to stay and invite you in? When did we see you poorly clothed and cover you?</verse>
				<verse number="39">When did we see you sick and tenderly care for you, or in prison and visit you?’</verse>
				<verse number="40">“And the King will answer them, ‘Don’t you know? When you cared for one of the least of these, my little ones, my true brothers and sisters, you demonstrated love for me.’</verse>
				<verse number="41">“Then to those on his left the King will say, ‘Leave me! For you are under the curse of eternal fire that has been destined for the devil and all his demons.</verse>
				<verse number="42">For when you saw me hungry, you gave me no food, and when you saw me thirsty, you gave me no drink.</verse>
				<verse number="43">I had no place to stay, and you refused to take me in as your guest. When you saw me poorly clothed, you closed your hearts and did not clothe me. When you saw that I was sick, you didn’t lift a finger to help me, and when I was imprisoned, you never came to visit me.’</verse>
				<verse number="44">“And then those on his left will say, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not give you food and something to drink? When did we see you homeless, or poorly clothed? When did we see you sick and not help you, or in prison and not visit you?’</verse>
				<verse number="45">“Then he will answer them, ‘Don’t you know? When you refused to help one of the least important among these my little ones, my true brothers and sisters, you refused to help and honor me.’</verse>
				<verse number="46">And they will depart from his presence into eternal punishment. But the godly and beloved ‘sheep’ will enter into eternal bliss.”</verse>

				<verse number="5">But they all agreed, “We can’t do this during the Passover celebrations or we could have a riot on our hands.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then Jesus went to Bethany, to the home of Simon, a man Jesus had healed of leprosy. A woman came into the house, holding an alabaster flask filled with expensive, fragrant oil. She came right to Jesus, and in a lavish gesture of devotion, she poured out the costly oil, and it cascaded over his head as he was at the table.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">When the disciples saw this, they were offended. “What a total waste!” they grumbled.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“We could have sold it for a great deal of money and given it to the poor.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, “Why are you critical of this woman? She has done a beautiful act of kindness.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You will always have someone poor whom you can help, but you will not always have me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When she poured the fragrant oil over me, she was preparing my body for burial.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I promise you that when this wonderful gospel spreads all over the world, the story of her lavish devotion to me will also be mentioned in memory of her.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">One of the twelve apostles, Judas the locksmith, went to the leading priests</verse>
				<verse number="15">and said, “How much are you willing to pay me to betray Jesus into your hands?” They agreed to pay him thirty silver coins.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Immediately Judas began to scheme and look for an opportunity to betray him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">On the first day of Passover, the day when all bread made with yeast was removed from every Jewish home, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where should we prepare the Passover meal for you?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">He answered them, “My heart longs with great desire to eat this Passover meal with you. Go into Jerusalem and you will encounter a man. Tell him that the teacher says, ‘My appointed time is near. I am coming to your home to eat the Passover meal with my disciples.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="19">The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When evening came he took his place at the table and dined with the Twelve.</verse>
				<verse number="21">While they were eating, Jesus spoke up and said, “One of you is about to betray me.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Feeling deeply hurt by these words, one after another asked him, “You don’t mean me, do you?”</verse>
				<verse number="23">He answered, “It is one who has shared meals with me as an intimate friend.</verse>
				<verse number="24">All that was prophesied of me will take place, but how terrible it will be for the one who betrays the Son of Man. It would be far better for him if he had never been born!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then finally, Judas the traitor spoke up and asked him, “Teacher, perhaps it is I?” Jesus answered, “You said it.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">As they ate, Jesus took the bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to his disciples. He said to them, “This is my body. Eat it.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then taking the cup of wine, he gave thanks to the Father, he entered into covenant with them, saying, “This is my blood. Each of you must drink it in fulfillment of the covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For this is the blood that seals the new covenant. It will be poured out for many for the complete forgiveness of sins.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The next time we drink this, I will be with you and we will drink it together with a new understanding in the kingdom realm of my Father.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then they sang a psalm and left for the Mount of Olives.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Along the way Jesus said to them, “Before the night is over, you will all desert me. This will fulfill the prophecy of the Scripture that says: I will strike down the shepherd and all the sheep will scatter far and wide!</verse>
				<verse number="32">“But after I am risen, I will go ahead of you to Galilee and will meet you there.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then Peter spoke up and said, “Even if all the rest lose courage and fall away, I will still be beside you, Jesus!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">“Are you sure, Peter?” Jesus said. “In fact, before the rooster crows a few hours from now, you will have denied me three times.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Peter replied, “I absolutely will never deny you, even if I have to die with you!” And all the others said the same thing.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then Jesus led his disciples to an orchard called “The Oil Press.” He told them, “Sit here while I go and pray nearby.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">He took Peter, Jacob, and John with him. However, an intense feeling of great sorrow plunged his soul into agony.</verse>
				<verse number="38">And he said to them, “My heart is overwhelmed and crushed with grief. It feels as though I’m dying. Stay here and keep watch with me.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Then he walked a short distance away, and overcome with grief, he threw himself facedown on the ground and prayed, “My Father, if there is any way you can deliver me from this suffering, please take it from me. Yet what I want is not important, for I only desire to fulfill your plan for me.” Then an angel from heaven appeared to strengthen him.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Later, he came back to his three disciples and found them all sound asleep. He awakened Peter and said to him, “Could you not stay awake with me for even one hour?</verse>
				<verse number="41">Keep alert and pray that you’ll be spared from this time of testing. Your spirit is eager enough, but your humanity is weak.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">Then he left them for a second time to pray in solitude. He said to God, “My Father, if there is not a way that you can deliver me from this suffering, then your will must be done.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">He came back to the disciples and found them sound asleep, for they couldn’t keep their eyes open.</verse>
				<verse number="44">So he left them and went away to pray the same prayer for the third time.</verse>
				<verse number="45">When he returned again to his disciples, he awoke them, saying, “Are you still sleeping? Don’t you know the hour has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to the authority of sinful men?</verse>
				<verse number="46">Get up and let’s go, for the betrayer has arrived.”</verse>
				<verse number="47">At that moment Judas, his once-trusted disciple, appeared, along with a large crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent to arrest Jesus by order of the ruling priests and Jewish religious leaders.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Now, Judas, the traitor, had arranged to give them a signal that would identify Jesus, for he had told them, “Jesus is the one whom I will kiss. So seize him!”</verse>
				<verse number="49">Judas quickly stepped up to Jesus and said, “Shalom, Rabbi,” and he kissed him on both cheeks.</verse>
				<verse number="50">“My beloved friend,” Jesus said, “is this why you’ve come?” Then the armed men seized Jesus to arrest him.</verse>
				<verse number="51">But one of the disciples pulled out a dagger and swung it at the servant of the high priest, slashing off his ear.</verse>
				<verse number="52">Jesus said to him, “Put your dagger away. For all those who embrace violence will die by violence.</verse>
				<verse number="53">Don’t you realize that I could ask my heavenly Father for angels to come at any time to deliver me? And instantly he would answer me by sending more than twelve legions of angels to come and protect us.</verse>
				<verse number="54">But that would thwart the prophetic plan of God. For it has been written that it would happen this way.”</verse>
				<verse number="55">Then Jesus turned to the mob and said, “Why would you arrest me with swords and clubs as though I were an outlaw? Day after day I sat in the temple courts with you, teaching the people, yet you didn’t arrest me.</verse>
				<verse number="56">But all of this fulfills the prophecies of the Scriptures.” At that point all of his disciples ran away and abandoned him.</verse>
				<verse number="57">Those who arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the chief priest, and to a meeting where the religious scholars and the supreme Jewish council were already assembled.</verse>
				<verse number="58">Now, Peter had followed the mob from a distance all the way to the chief priest’s courtyard. And after entering, he sat with the servants of the chief priest who had gathered there, waiting to see how things would unfold.</verse>
				<verse number="59">The chief priests and the entire supreme Jewish council of leaders were doing their best to bring false charges against Jesus, because they were looking for a reason to put him to death.</verse>
				<verse number="60">Many false witnesses came forward, but the evidence could not be corroborated. Finally two men came forward</verse>
				<verse number="61">and declared, “This man said, ‘I can destroy God’s temple and build it again in three days!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="62">Then the chief priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Have you nothing to say about these allegations? Is what they’re saying about you true?”</verse>
				<verse number="63">But Jesus remained silent before them. So the chief priest said to him, “I charge you under oath—in the name of the living God, tell us once and for all if you are the anointed Messiah, the Son of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="64">Jesus answered him, “You just said it yourself. And more than that, you are about to see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of God, the Almighty. And one day you will also see the Son of Man coming in the heavenly clouds!”</verse>
				<verse number="65">This infuriated the chief priest, and as an act of outrage, he tore his robe and shouted, “What blasphemy! No more witnesses are needed, for you heard this grievous blasphemy.”</verse>
				<verse number="66">Turning to the council he said, “Now, what is your verdict?” “He’s guilty and deserves the death penalty!” they answered.</verse>
				<verse number="67">Then they spat on his face and slapped him. Others struck him over and over with their fists.</verse>
				<verse number="68">Then they taunted him by saying, “Oh, Anointed One, prophesy to us! Tell us which one of us is about to hit you next?”</verse>
				<verse number="69">Meanwhile, Peter was still sitting outside in the courtyard when a servant girl came up to him and said, “I recognize you. You were with Jesus the Galilean.”</verse>
				<verse number="70">In front of everyone Peter denied it and said, “I don’t have a clue what you’re talking about.”</verse>
				<verse number="71">Later, as he stood near the gateway of the courtyard, another servant girl noticed him and said, “I know this man is a follower of Jesus the Nazarene!”</verse>
				<verse number="72">Once again, Peter denied it, and with an oath he said, “I tell you, I don’t know the man!”</verse>
				<verse number="73">A short time later, those standing nearby approached Peter and said, “We know you’re one of his disciples—we can tell by your speech. Your Galilean accent gives you away!”</verse>
				<verse number="74">Peter denied it, and using profanity he said, “I don’t know the man!” At that very moment the sound of a crowing rooster pierced the night.</verse>
				<verse number="75">Then Peter remembered the prophecy of Jesus, “Before the rooster crows you will have denied me three times.” With a shattered heart, Peter left the courtyard, sobbing with bitter tears.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="27">
				<verse number="1">Before dawn that morning, all the chief priests and religious leaders resolved to take action against Jesus and decided that he should be executed.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So they bound him and led him away to Pilate, the Roman governor.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now, when Judas, the betrayer, saw that Jesus had been sentenced to death, remorse filled his heart. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and religious leaders,</verse>
				<verse number="4">saying, “I have sinned by betraying an innocent man.” They replied, “Why are you bothering us? That’s your problem.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Judas flung the silver coins inside the temple and went out and hanged himself.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The chief priests, picking up the pieces of silver, said, “We can’t keep this, for it’s unlawful to put blood money into the temple treasury.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So after some deliberation, they decided to purchase the potter’s field of clay, to use as a cemetery for burying strangers.</verse>
				<verse number="8">That’s why that land has been called “The Field of Blood.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">This fulfilled the prophecy of Zechariah: They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price at which he was valued by the people of Israel, the price of a precious man,</verse>
				<verse number="10">And they bought the potter’s field, as the Lord directed.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As Jesus stood in front of the Roman governor, Pilate asked him, “So, you are the king of the Jews?” Jesus answered, “You have just spoken it.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then he was accused by the chief priests and religious leaders, but he remained silent.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Pilate said, “Don’t you hear these allegations?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">But Jesus offered no defense to any of the charges, much to the great astonishment of Pilate.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Now, every year at Passover it was the custom of the governor to pardon a prisoner and release him to the people—anyone they wanted.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And at that time, Pilate was holding in custody a notorious criminal named Jesus Barabbas.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So as the crowds of people assembled outside of Pilate’s residence, he went out and offered them a choice. He asked them, “Who would you want me to release to you today, Jesus who is called Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Anointed One?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">(Now, Pilate was fully aware that the religious leaders had handed Jesus over to him because of their bitter jealousy.)</verse>
				<verse number="19">Just then, as Pilate was presiding over the tribunal, his wife sent him an urgent message: “Don’t harm that holy man, for I suffered a horrible nightmare last night about him!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Meanwhile, the chief priest and the religious leaders were inciting the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be freed and to have Jesus killed.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So Pilate asked them again, “Which of the two men would you like me to release for you?” They shouted, “Barabbas.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Pilate asked them, “Then what would you have me to do with Jesus who is called the Anointed One?” They all shouted back, “Crucify him!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">“Why?” Pilate asked. “What has he done wrong?” But they kept shouting out, “Crucify him!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">When Pilate realized that a riot was about to break out and that it was useless to try to reason with the crowd, he sent for a basin of water. After washing his hands in front of the people, he said, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. The responsibility for his death is now yours!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">And the crowd replied, “Let his blood be on us and on our children!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">So he released Barabbas to the people. He ordered that Jesus be beaten with a whip of leather straps embedded with metal, and afterward be crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then the guards took him into their military compound, where a detachment of nearly six hundred soldiers surrounded him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">They stripped off his clothing and placed a scarlet robe on him to make fun of him.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then they braided a crown of thorns and forcefully shoved it onto his head. After placing a reed staff in his right hand, they knelt down before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then they spat in his face and took the reed staff from his hand and hit him repeatedly on his head, driving the crown of thorns deeper.</verse>
				<verse number="31">When they finished ridiculing him, they took off the scarlet robe and put his own clothes back on him and led him away to be crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And as they came out of the city, they stopped an African man named Simon, from Libya, and compelled him to carry the cross for Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="33">They brought Jesus to Golgotha, which means “Skull Hill.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">And there the soldiers offered him a mild painkiller, a drink of wine mixed with gall, but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then they crucified Jesus, nailing his hands and feet to the cross. The soldiers divided his clothing among themselves by rolling dice to see who would win them.</verse>
				<verse number="36">And the soldiers stood there to watch what would happen and to keep guard over him.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Above his head they placed a sign that read, “This is Jesus of Nazareth, King of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Two criminals were also crucified with Jesus, one on each side of him.</verse>
				<verse number="39">And those who passed by shook their heads and ridiculed him,</verse>
				<verse number="40">saying, “We heard you boast that you could destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days! Why don’t you save yourself now? If you’re really God’s Son, come down from the cross!”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Even the ruling priests, with the Jewish scholars and religious leaders, joined in the mockery</verse>
				<verse number="42">and kept on saying, “He saved others, but he can’t even save himself! Israel’s king, is he? He should pull out the nails and come down from the cross right now; then we’ll believe in him!</verse>
				<verse number="43">He puts his trust in God, so let’s see if it’s true, and see if God really wants to rescue him, for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="44">Even the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus began to taunt him, hurling their insults on him.</verse>
				<verse number="45">For three hours, beginning at noon, a sudden and unexpected darkness came over the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="46">And at three o’clock Jesus shouted with a mighty voice in Aramaic, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” —that is, “My God, My God, why have you deserted me?”</verse>
				<verse number="47">Some who were standing near the cross misunderstood and said, “He’s calling for Elijah.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">One bystander ran and got a sponge, soaked it with sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Jesus to drink.</verse>
				<verse number="49">But the rest said, “Leave him alone! Let’s see if Elijah comes to rescue him.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Jesus passionately cried out, took his last breath, and gave up his spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="51">At that moment the veil in the Holy of Holies was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth shook violently, rocks were violently split apart,</verse>
				<verse number="52">and graves were opened. Then many of the holy ones who had died were brought back to life and came out of their graves.</verse>
				<verse number="53">And after Jesus’ resurrection, they were seen by many people walking in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Now, when the Roman military officer and his soldiers witnessed what was happening and felt the powerful earthquake, they were extremely terrified. They said, “There is no doubt, this man was the Son of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="55">Watching from a distance were many of the women who had followed him from Galilee and given him support.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Among them were Mary Magdalene; Mary, the mother of Jacob and Joseph; and the mother of Jacob and John.</verse>
				<verse number="57">At the end of the day, a wealthy man named Joseph, a follower of Jesus from the village of Ramah,</verse>
				<verse number="58">approached Pilate and asked if he could take custody of the body of Jesus. So Pilate consented and ordered that the body be given to him.</verse>
				<verse number="59">Then Joseph wrapped the body in a shroud of fine linen and placed it in his own unused tomb, which had only recently been cut into the rock.</verse>
				<verse number="60">They rolled a large stone to seal the entrance of the tomb and left.</verse>
				<verse number="61">Sitting across from the tomb were Mary Magdalene and the other Marys, watching all that took place.</verse>
				<verse number="62">The next day, the day after Preparation Day for Passover, the chief priests and the Pharisees went together to Pilate.</verse>
				<verse number="63">They said to him, “Our master, we remember that this imposter claimed that he would rise from the dead after three days.</verse>
				<verse number="64">So please, order the tomb to be sealed until after the third day. Seal it so that his disciples can’t come and steal the corpse and tell people he rose from the dead. Then the last deception would be worse than the first!”</verse>
				<verse number="65">“I will send soldiers to guard the tomb,” Pilate replied. “Go with them and make the tomb as secure as possible.”</verse>
				<verse number="66">So they left and sealed the stone, and Pilate’s soldiers secured the tomb.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="28">
				<verse number="1">After the Sabbath ended, at the first light of dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to take a look at the tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Suddenly, the earth shook violently beneath their feet as the angel of the Yahweh descended from heaven. Lightning flashed around him and his robe was dazzling white! The guards were stunned and terrified—lying motionless like dead men. Then the angel walked up to the tomb, rolled away the stone, and sat on top of it!</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">The women were breathless and terrified, until the angel said to them, “There’s no reason to be afraid. I know you’re here looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He isn’t here—he has risen victoriously, just as he said! Come inside the tomb and see the place where our Lord was lying.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then run and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead! I give you his message: ‘I am going ahead of you to Galilee and you will see me there.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">They rushed quickly to tell his disciples, and their hearts were filled with fear, awe, and great joy at the same time.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Along the way, Jesus suddenly appeared in front of them and said, “Rejoice!” They were so overwhelmed by seeing him that they bowed down and grasped his feet in adoring worship.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Jesus said to them, “Throw off all your fears. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will find me there.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">After the women left the tomb, a few of the guards went into Jerusalem and told the chief priests everything they had seen and heard.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So the chief priests called a meeting with all the religious leaders and came up with a plan. They bribed the guards with a large sum of money</verse>
				<verse number="13">and told them, “Tell everyone, ‘While we were asleep, his disciples came at night and stole his body!’</verse>
				<verse number="14">If Pilate finds out about this, don’t worry. We’ll make sure you don’t get blamed.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So they took the money and did as they were told. (That is why the story of the guards is still circulated among the Jews to this day.)</verse>
				<verse number="16">Meanwhile, the eleven disciples heard the wonderful news from the women and left for Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had arranged to meet them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The moment they saw him, they worshiped him, but some still had lingering doubts.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Jesus came close to them and said, “All authority of the universe has been given to me.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now wherever you go, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And teach them to faithfully follow all that I have commanded you. And never forget that I am with you every day, even to the completion of this age.”</verse>
			</chapter>
		</book>
		<book number="41">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">This is the beginning of the wonderful news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">It starts with Isaiah the prophet, who wrote: Listen! I am sending my messenger ahead of you and he will prepare your way!</verse>
				<verse number="3">He is a thunderous voice of one who shouts in the wilderness: “Prepare your hearts for the coming of the Lord Yahweh, and clear a straight path inside your hearts for him!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">John the Baptizer was the messenger who appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the complete cancellation of sins.</verse>
				<verse number="5">A steady stream of people came to be dipped in the Jordan River as they publicly confessed their sins. They came from all over southern Israel, including nearly all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="6">John wore a rough garment made from camel hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and honey.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And this is the message he kept preaching: “There is a man coming after me who is greater and a lot more powerful than I am. I’m not even worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I’ve baptized you into water, but he will baptize you into the Spirit of Holiness!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">One day, Jesus came from the Galilean village of Nazareth and had John immerse him in the Jordan River.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The moment Jesus rose up out of the water, John saw the heavenly realm split open, and the Holy Spirit descended upon him like a dove.</verse>
				<verse number="11">At the same time, a voice spoke from heaven, saying: “You are my Son, my cherished one, and my greatest delight is in you!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Immediately after this he was compelled by the Holy Spirit to go into an uninhabited desert region.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He remained there in the wilderness for forty days, enduring the ordeals of Satan’s tests. He encountered wild animals, but also angels who appeared and ministered to his needs.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Later on, after John the Baptizer was arrested, Jesus went back into the region of Galilee and preached the wonderful gospel of God’s kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="15">His message was this: “At last the fulfillment of the age has come! It is time for God’s kingdom to be experienced in its fullness! Turn your lives back to God and put your trust in the hope-filled gospel!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">As Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee, he noticed two brothers fishing: Simon and Andrew. He watched them as they were casting their nets into the sea</verse>
				<verse number="17">and said to them, “Come follow me and I will transform you into fishers of men instead of fish!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Immediately they dropped their nets and left everything behind to follow Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Walking a little farther, Jesus found two other brothers sitting in a boat, along with their father, mending their nets. Their names were Jacob and John, and their father Zebedee.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Jesus immediately walked up to them and invited the two brothers to become his followers. Jacob and John dropped their nets, stood up, left their father in the boat with the hired men, and followed Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then Jesus and his disciples went to Capernaum, and he immediately started teaching on the Sabbath day in the synagogue.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The people were awestruck by his teaching, because he taught in a way that demonstrated God’s authority, which was quite unlike the religious scholars.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Suddenly, during the meeting, a demon-possessed man screamed out,</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Hey! Leave us alone! Jesus the victorious, I know who you are. You’re God’s Holy One and you have come to destroy us!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Silence! You are bound! Come out of him!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">The man’s body shook violently in spasms, and the demon hurled him to the floor until it finally came out of him with a deafening shriek!</verse>
				<verse number="27">The crowd was awestruck and kept saying among themselves, “What is this new teaching that comes with such authority? With merely a word he commands demons to come out and they obey him!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">So the reports about Jesus spread like wildfire throughout every community in Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Now, as soon as they left the meeting, they went straight to Simon and Andrew’s house, along with Jacob and John.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Simon’s mother-in-law was bedridden, sick with a high fever, so the first thing they did was to tell Jesus about her.</verse>
				<verse number="31">He walked up to her bedside, gently took her hand, and raised her up! Her fever disappeared and she began to serve them.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Later in the day, just after the Sabbath ended at sunset, the people kept bringing to Jesus all who were sick and tormented by demons,</verse>
				<verse number="33">until the whole village was crowded around the house.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. But he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew who he really was.</verse>
				<verse number="35">The next morning, Jesus got up long before daylight, left the house while it was dark, and made his way to a secluded place to give himself to prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Later, Simon and his friends searched for him,</verse>
				<verse number="37">and when they finally tracked him down, they told him, “Everyone is looking for you—they want you!”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Jesus replied, “We have to go on to the surrounding villages so that I can share my message with the people there, for that is my mission.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">So he went throughout the region of Galilee, preaching in the Jewish synagogues and casting out demons.</verse>
				<verse number="40">On one occasion, a leper came and threw himself down in front of Jesus, pleading for his healing, saying, “You have the power to heal me right now if only you really want to!”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Being deeply moved with tender compassion, Jesus reached out and touched the skin of the leper and told him, “Of course I want you to be healed—so now, be cleansed!”</verse>
				<verse number="42">Instantly his leprous sores completely disappeared and his skin became smooth!</verse>
				<verse number="43">Jesus sent him away with a very stern warning,</verse>
				<verse number="44">saying, “Don’t say anything to anyone about what just happened, but go find a priest and show him that you’ve been healed. Then bring the offering that Moses commanded for your cleansing as a living testimony to everyone.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">But no sooner did the man leave than he began to proclaim his healing publicly and tell the story everywhere. Jesus’ growing fame prevented him from entering the villages openly, which forced him to remain in isolated places. Even so, a steady stream of people flocked to him from everywhere.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Several days later, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the news quickly spread that he was back in town.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Soon there were so many people crowded inside the house to hear him that there was no more room, even outside the door. While Jesus was preaching the word of God,</verse>
				<verse number="3">four men arrived, carrying a paralyzed man.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But when they realized that they couldn’t even get near him because of the crowd, they went up on top of the house and tore away the roof above Jesus’ head. And when they had broken through, they lowered the paralyzed man on a stretcher right down in front of him!</verse>
				<verse number="5">When Jesus saw the extent of their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “My son, your sins are now forgiven.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">This offended some of the religious scholars who were present, and they reasoned among themselves,</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Who does he think he is to speak this way? This is blasphemy for sure! Only God himself can forgive sins!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus supernaturally perceived their thoughts and said to them, “Why are you being so skeptical?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Which is easier, to say to this paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are now forgiven,’ or, ‘Stand up and walk!’?</verse>
				<verse number="10">But to convince you that the Son of Man has been given authority to forgive sins,</verse>
				<verse number="11">I say to this man, ‘Stand up, pick up your stretcher, and walk home.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Immediately the man was healed and sprang to his feet in front of everyone and left for home. When the crowd witnessed this miracle, they were awestruck. They shouted praises to God and said, “We’ve never seen anything like this before!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Jesus went out to walk near Lake Galilee, and a massive crowd gathered, so he taught them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">As he walked along, he found Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at a tax booth, collecting taxes. He approached him and said, “Come follow me.” Immediately he got up from his booth and began to follow Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Later, Jesus and his disciples went to have a meal with Levi. Among the guests in Levi’s home were many tax collectors and notable sinners sharing a meal with Jesus, for there were many kinds of people who followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But when the religious scholars and the Pharisees found out that Jesus was keeping company and dining with sinners and tax collectors, they were indignant. So they approached Jesus’ disciples and said to them, “Why is it that someone like Jesus defiles himself by eating with sinners and tax collectors?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">But when Jesus overheard their complaint, he said to them, “Who goes to the doctor for a cure? Those who are well or those who are sick? I have not come to call the ‘righteous,’ but those who are sinners and bring them to repentance.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">One time, the disciples of John the Baptizer and the Pharisees were fasting. So they came to Jesus and asked, “Why is it that John’s disciples and disciples of the Pharisees are fasting but your disciples are not?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus answered, “How can the sons of the bridal chamber fast when the bridegroom is next to them? As long as the bridegroom is with them they won’t,</verse>
				<verse number="20">but the days of fasting will come when the Bridegroom is taken from them.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“And who would mend worn-out clothing with new fabric? When the new cloth shrinks, it will rip, making the tear worse than before.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And who would pour new wine into an old wineskin? Eventually the wine will ferment and make the wineskin burst, losing everything—the wine will be spilled and the wineskin ruined. Instead, new wine is always poured into new wineskins.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">One Sabbath, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of wheat. The disciples were hungry, so they plucked off some heads of grain to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But when some of the Pharisees saw what was happening, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples shouldn’t be harvesting grain on the Sabbath!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus responded, “Haven’t you ever read what King David and his men did when they were hungry?</verse>
				<verse number="26">They entered the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the sacred bread of God’s presence. They violated the law by eating bread that only the priests were allowed to eat. But there is one here who is even greater than the temple.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for the sake of people, and not people for the Sabbath.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For this reason the Son of Man exercises his lordship over the Sabbath.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Then Jesus left them and went again into the synagogue, where he encountered a man who had an atrophied, paralyzed hand.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Everyone was watching Jesus closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath, giving them a reason to accuse him of breaking Sabbath rules.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand, “Stand here in the middle of the room.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then he turned to all those gathered there and said, “Is it against the law to do evil on the Sabbath or to do good? To destroy a life or to save one?” But no one answered him a word.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then looking around at everyone, Jesus was moved with indignation and grieved by the hardness of their hearts and said to the man, “Now stretch out your hand!” As he stretched out his hand, it was instantly healed!</verse>
				<verse number="6">After this happened, the Pharisees left abruptly and began to plot together with the friends and supporters of Herod Antipas on how they would kill Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Once again Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lakeside, but a massive crowd of people followed him from all around the provinces of Galilee and southern Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Vast crowds came from Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and from Lebanon. Large numbers of people swarmed in from everywhere when they heard of him and his wonderful works.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The crowd pressed so closely to Jesus that he instructed his disciples to bring him a small boat to get into and keep from being crushed by the crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For he had healed so many that the sick kept pushing forward just so they could touch Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And whenever a demon saw him, it would throw the person down at Jesus’ feet, screaming out, “You are the Son of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">But Jesus would silence the demons and sternly order them not to reveal who he was.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Afterward, Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to himself the men he wanted to be his close companions, so they went up with him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He appointed the Twelve, whom he named apostles. He wanted them to be continually at his side as his friends, and so that he could send them out to preach</verse>
				<verse number="15">and have authority to heal the sick and to cast out demons.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He appointed his Twelve and gave Simon the nickname Peter the Rock.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And he gave the brothers, Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, the nickname Benay-Regah, which means “passionate sons.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">The others were Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, Jacob the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Nationalist,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then Jesus went home, but once again a large crowd gathered around him, which prevented him from even eating a meal.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When his own family heard that he was there, they went out to seize him, for they said, “He’s insane!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">The religious scholars who arrived from Jerusalem were saying, “Satan has possessed him! He casts out demons by the authority of the prince of demons!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus called them to himself and spoke to them using parables. “How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
				<verse number="24">No kingdom can endure if it is divided against itself,</verse>
				<verse number="25">and a fragmented household will not be able to stand, for it is divided.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And if Satan fights against himself he will not endure, and his end has come.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Jesus said to them, “Listen. No one is able to break into a mighty man’s house and steal his property unless he first overpowers the mighty man and ties him up. Then his entire house can be plundered and his possessions taken.</verse>
				<verse number="28">I tell you this timeless truth: All sin will be forgiven, even all the blasphemies that are spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="29">But there can never be forgiveness for the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, for he is guilty of an eternal sin!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">(This is because they said he was empowered by a demon spirit.)</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then Jesus’ mother and his brothers came and stood outside and sent a message to him, asking that he come out and speak with them.</verse>
				<verse number="32">When the crowd sitting around Jesus heard this, they spoke up, and said to him, “Jesus, your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">He answered them, “Who is my true mother and my true brothers?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then looking in the eyes of those who were sitting in a circle around him, he said, “Here are my true family members.</verse>
				<verse number="35">For whoever does the will of God is my brother, my sister, and my mother!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Once again Jesus went to teach the people at the shore of Lake Galilee and a massive crowd surrounded him. The crowd was so huge that he had to get into a boat and teach the people from there.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He taught them many things by using parables to illustrate spiritual truths, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Consider this: A sower went out to sow.</verse>
				<verse number="4">As he sowed some fell along the beaten path and soon the birds came and ate it.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Some fell onto gravel with no topsoil and quickly sprouted since the soil had no depth.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But when the days grew hot, the sprouts were scorched and withered because they had insufficient roots.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Some fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But some fell onto good, rich soil that kept producing a good harvest. Some yielded thirty, some sixty—and some a hundredfold!</verse>
				<verse number="9">If you understand this, then you need to respond.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Afterward, Jesus’ disciples and those close to him remained behind to ask Jesus about his parables.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He said to them, “The privilege of intimately knowing the mystery of God’s kingdom realm has been granted to you, but not to the others, where everything is revealed in parables.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“For even when they see what I do, they will not understand, and when they hear what I say, they will learn nothing, otherwise they would repent and be forgiven.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then he said to them, “If you don’t understand this parable, how will you understand any parable?</verse>
				<verse number="14">Let me explain: The farmer sows the message of the kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="15">What falls on the beaten path represents those who hear the message, but immediately Satan appears and snatches it from their hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And what is sown on gravel represents those who hear the message and receive it joyfully,</verse>
				<verse number="17">but because their hearts fail to sink a deep root, they don’t endure for long. For when trouble or persecution comes on account of the message, they immediately wilt and fall away.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And what is sown among thorns represents those who hear the message,</verse>
				<verse number="19">but they allow the cares of this life and the seduction of wealth and the desires for other things to crowd out and choke the message so that it produces nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“But what is sown on good soil represents those who open their hearts to receive the message and their lives bear good fruit—some yield a harvest of thirty, sixty, even a hundredfold!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">He also gave them this parable: “No one lights a lamp only to place it under a basket or under the bed. It is meant to be placed on a lampstand.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For there is nothing that is hidden that won’t be disclosed, and there is no secret that won’t be brought out into the light!</verse>
				<verse number="23">If you understand what I’m saying, you need to respond!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then he said to them, “Be diligent to understand the meaning behind everything you hear, for as you do, more understanding will be given to you. And according to your longing to understand, much more will be added to you.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For those who listen with open hearts will receive more revelation. But those who don’t listen with open hearts will lose what little they think they have!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Jesus also told them this parable: “God’s kingdom realm is like someone spreading seed on the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="27">He goes to bed and gets up, day after day, and the seed sprouts and grows tall, though he knows not how.</verse>
				<verse number="28">All by itself it sprouts, and the soil produces a crop; first the green stem, then the head on the stalk, and then the fully developed grain in the head.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then, when the grain is ripe, he immediately puts the sickle to the grain, because harvest time has come.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">And he told them this parable: “How can I describe God’s kingdom realm? Let me illustrate it with this parable.</verse>
				<verse number="31">It is like the mustard seed, the tiniest of all the seeds,</verse>
				<verse number="32">yet when it springs up and grows, it becomes the largest plant in the garden, with so many large spreading branches, even birds can nest in its shade.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Jesus used many parables such as these as he taught the people, and they learned according to their ability to understand.</verse>
				<verse number="34">He never spoke to them without using parables, but would wait until he was alone with his disciples to explain to them their meanings.</verse>
				<verse number="35">That same day, after it grew dark, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s cross over to the other side of the lake.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Leaving the crowd behind, the disciples got into the boat in which Jesus was already sitting, and they took him with them. Other boats sailed with them.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Suddenly, as they were crossing the lake, a ferocious storm arose, with violent winds and waves that were crashing into the boat until it was nearly swamped.</verse>
				<verse number="38">But Jesus was calmly sleeping in the stern, resting on a cushion.</verse>
				<verse number="39">So they shook him awake, saying, “Teacher, don’t you even care that we are all about to die!” Fully awake, he rebuked the storm and shouted to the sea, “Hush! Be still!” All at once the wind stopped howling and the water became perfectly calm.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Then he turned to his disciples and said to them, “Why are you so afraid? Haven’t you learned to trust yet?”</verse>
				<verse number="41">But they were overwhelmed with fear and awe and said to one another, “Who is this man who has such authority that even the wind and waves obey him?”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">They arrived at the other side of the lake, at the region of the Gerasenes.</verse>
				<verse number="2">As Jesus stepped ashore, a demon-possessed madman came out of the graveyard and confronted him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The man had been living there among the tombs, and no one was able to restrain him, not even with chains.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For every time they attempted to chain his hands and feet with shackles, he would snap the chains and break the shackles in pieces. He was so strong that no one had the power to subdue him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Day and night he could be found lurking in the cemetery or in the vicinity, shrieking and cutting himself with stones!</verse>
				<verse number="6">When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran to him and threw himself down before him,</verse>
				<verse number="7">shouting at the top of his lungs, “Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! Swear in God’s name that you won’t torture me!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">(For Jesus had already said to him, “Come out of that man, you demon spirit!”)</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus said to him, “What is your name?” “Mob,” he answered. “They call me Mob because there are thousands of us in his body!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">He begged Jesus repeatedly not to expel them out of the region.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Nearby there was a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The demons begged him, “Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So Jesus gave them permission, and the demon horde immediately came out of the man and went into the pigs! This caused the herd to rush madly down the steep slope and fall into the lake, drowning about two thousand pigs!</verse>
				<verse number="14">At this, the herdsmen ran to the nearby villages, telling everyone along the way what had happened, and the people came out to see for themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When they found Jesus, they saw the demonized man sitting there, properly clothed and in his right mind. Seeing what had happened to the man possessed by many demons, the people became afraid.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Those who had witnessed this miracle reported the news to the people and included what had happened to the pigs.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then they asked Jesus to leave their region.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And as Jesus began to get into the boat to depart, the man who had been set free from demons asked him, “Could I go with you?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus answered, “No,” but said to him, “Go back to your home and to your family and tell them what the Lord has done for you. Tell them how he had mercy on you.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">So the man left and went into the region of Jordan and parts of Syria to tell everyone he met about what Jesus had done for him, and all the people marveled!</verse>
				<verse number="21">After Jesus returned from across the lake, a huge crowd of people quickly gathered around him on the shoreline.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Just then, a man saw that it was Jesus, so he pushed through the crowd and threw himself down at his feet. His name was Jairus, a Jewish official who was in charge of the synagogue.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He pleaded with Jesus, saying over and over, “Please come with me! My little daughter is at the point of death, and she’s only twelve years old! Come and lay your hands on her and heal her and she will live!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Immediately Jesus went with him, and the huge crowd followed, pressing in on him from all sides.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now, in the crowd that day was a woman who had suffered horribly from continual bleeding for twelve years.</verse>
				<verse number="26">She had endured a great deal under the care of various doctors, yet in spite of spending all she had on their treatments, she was getting worse instead of better.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When she heard about Jesus’ healing power, she pushed through the crowd and came up from behind him and touched his prayer shawl.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For she kept saying to herself, “If I could touch even his clothes, I know I will be healed.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">As soon as her hand touched him, her bleeding immediately stopped! She knew it, for she could feel her body instantly being healed of her disease!</verse>
				<verse number="30">Jesus knew at once that someone had touched him, for he felt the power that always surged around him had passed through him for someone to be healed. He turned and spoke to the crowd, saying, “Who touched my clothes?”</verse>
				<verse number="31">His disciples answered, “What do you mean, who touched you? Look at this huge crowd—they’re all pressing up against you.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">But Jesus’ eyes swept across the crowd, looking for the one who had touched him for healing.</verse>
				<verse number="33">When the woman who experienced this miracle realized what had happened to her, she came before him, trembling with fear, and threw herself down at his feet, saying, “I was the one who touched you.” And she told him her story of what had just happened.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then Jesus said to her, “Daughter, because you dared to believe, your faith has healed you. Go with peace in your heart, and be free from your suffering!”</verse>
				<verse number="35">And before he had finished speaking, people arrived from Jairus’ house and pushed through the crowd to give Jairus the news: “There’s no need to trouble the master any longer—your daughter has died.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">But Jesus refused to listen to what they were told and said to the Jewish official, “Don’t yield to fear. All you need to do is to keep on believing.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">So they left for his home, but Jesus didn’t allow anyone to go with them except Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John.</verse>
				<verse number="38">When they arrived at the home of the synagogue ruler, they encountered a noisy uproar among the people, for they were all weeping and wailing.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Upon entering the home, Jesus said to them, “Why all this grief and weeping? Don’t you know the girl is not dead but merely asleep?”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Then everyone began to ridicule and make fun of him. But he threw them all outside. Then he took the child’s father and mother and his three disciples and went into the room where the girl was lying.</verse>
				<verse number="41">He tenderly clasped the child’s hand in his and said to her in Aramaic, “Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, wake up from the sleep of death.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">Instantly the twelve-year-old girl sat up, stood to her feet, and started walking around the room! Everyone was overcome with astonishment in seeing this miracle!</verse>
				<verse number="43">Jesus had them bring her something to eat. And he cautioned them repeatedly that they were to tell no one about what had happened.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Afterward, Jesus left Capernaum and returned with his disciples to Nazareth, his hometown.</verse>
				<verse number="2">On the Sabbath, he went to teach in the synagogue. Everyone who heard his teaching was overwhelmed with astonishment. They said among themselves, “What incredible wisdom has been given to him! Where did he receive such profound insights? And what mighty miracles flow through his hands!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Isn’t this Mary’s son, the carpenter, the brother of Jacob, Joseph, Judah, and Simon? And don’t his sisters all live here in Nazareth?” And they took offense at him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus said to them, “A prophet is treated with honor everywhere except in his own hometown, among his relatives, and in his own house.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">He was unable to do any great miracle in Nazareth, except to heal a few sick people by laying his hands upon them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He was amazed at the depth of their unbelief! Then Jesus went out into the different villages and taught the people.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jesus gathered his twelve disciples and imparted to them his authority to cast out demons. Then he sent them out in pairs with these instructions:</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Take only your staff and the sandals on your feet—no bread, no knapsack, no extra garment, and no money.</verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10">And whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave the area.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Whatever community does not welcome you or receive your message, leave it behind. And as you go, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">So they went out and preached publicly that everyone should repent.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They cast out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">King Herod soon heard about Jesus, for the name of Jesus was on everyone’s lips. Some were even saying about him, “John the Baptizer has been raised from the dead, and that’s why miraculous powers flow from him!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Others said, “No, he’s Elijah!” While others said, “He’s a prophet, like one of the prophets of old!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">When Herod heard what the people were saying, he concluded, “I beheaded John, and now he’s raised from the dead!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">For Herod had John arrested and thrown into prison for repeatedly rebuking him in public, saying, “You have no right to marry Herodias, the wife of your brother Philip! You are violating the law of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="18"></verse>
				<verse number="19">This infuriated Herodias, and she held a bitter grudge against him and wanted John executed.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But Herod both feared and stood in awe of John and kept him safely in custody, because he was convinced that he was a righteous and holy man. Every time Herod heard John speak, it disturbed his soul, but he was drawn to him and was intrigued by his words.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But Herodias found her opportunity to have John killed—it was on the king’s birthday! Herod prepared a great banquet and invited all his officials, military commanders, and the leaders of the province of Galilee to celebrate with him on his birthday.</verse>
				<verse number="22">On the day of the feast, his stepdaughter, the daughter of Herodias, came to honor the king with a beautiful dance, and she flattered him. Her dancing greatly pleased the king and his guests, so he said to the girl, “You can ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">And he repeated it in front of everyone, with a vow to complete his promise to her: “Anything you desire and it will be yours! I’ll even share my kingdom with you!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">She immediately left the room and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” Her mother answered, “The head of John the Baptizer on a platter!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">So she hurried back to the king and made her request: “I want you to bring me the head of John the Baptizer on a platter—and I want it right now!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Deeply grieved, the king regretted his promise to her, but since he had made his vow in front of all his honored guests, he couldn’t deny her request.</verse>
				<verse number="27">So without delay the king ordered an executioner to bring John’s head, and he went and beheaded John in prison.</verse>
				<verse number="28">He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl brought it to her mother.</verse>
				<verse number="29">When John’s followers heard what had happened, they came and removed his body and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The apostles returned from their mission and gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught.</verse>
				<verse number="31">There was such a swirl of activity around Jesus, with so many people coming and going, that they were unable to even eat a meal. So Jesus said to his disciples, “Come, let’s take a break and find a secluded place where you can rest a while.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">They slipped away and left by sailboat for a deserted spot.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But many of the people saw them leaving and realized where they were headed, so they took off running along the shore. Then people from the surrounding towns joined them in the chase, and a large crowd got there ahead of them.</verse>
				<verse number="34">By the time Jesus came ashore, a massive crowd was waiting. At the sight of them, his heart was filled with compassion, because they seemed like wandering sheep who had no shepherd. So he taught them many wonderful things.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Late that afternoon, his disciples said, “It’s getting really late and we’re here in this remote place with nothing to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="36">You should send the crowds away so they can go into the surrounding villages and buy food.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.” “Are you sure?” they replied. “You really want us to go buy them supper? It would cost a small fortune to feed all these thousands of hungry people.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">“How many loaves of bread do you have?” he asked. “Go and see.” After they had looked around, they came back and said, “Five—plus a couple of fish.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Then he instructed them to organize the crowd and have them sit down in groups on the grass.</verse>
				<verse number="40">So they had them sit down in groups of hundreds and fifties.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Then Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, gazed into heaven, and gave thanks to God. He broke the bread and the two fish and distributed them to his disciples to serve the people— and the food was multiplied in front of their eyes!</verse>
				<verse number="42">Everyone had plenty to eat and was fully satisfied.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Then the twelve disciples picked up what remained, and each of them ended up with a basket full of leftovers!</verse>
				<verse number="44">Altogether, five thousand families were fed that day!</verse>
				<verse number="45">After everyone had their meal, Jesus instructed his disciples to get back into the boat and go on ahead of him and sail to the other side to Bethsaida.</verse>
				<verse number="46">So he dispersed the crowd, said good-bye to his disciples, then slipped away to pray on the mountain.</verse>
				<verse number="47">As night fell, the boat was in the middle of the lake and Jesus was alone on land.</verse>
				<verse number="48">The wind was against the disciples and he could see that they were straining at the oars, trying to make headway. When it was almost morning, Jesus came to them, walking on the surface of the water, and he started to pass by them.</verse>
				<verse number="49">When they all saw him walking on the waves, they thought he was a ghost and screamed out in terror. But he said to them at once, “Don’t yield to fear. Have courage. It’s really me—I Am!”</verse>
				<verse number="50"></verse>
				<verse number="51">Then he came closer and climbed into the boat with them, and immediately the stormy wind became still. They were completely and utterly overwhelmed with astonishment.</verse>
				<verse number="52">Their doubting hearts had not grasped his authority and power over all things in spite of just having witnessed the miraculous feeding.</verse>
				<verse number="53">They made landfall at Gennesaret and anchored there.</verse>
				<verse number="54">The moment they got out of the boat, everyone recognized that it was Jesus, the healer!</verse>
				<verse number="55">So they ran throughout the region, telling the people, “Bring all the sick—even those too sick to walk and bring them on mats!”</verse>
				<verse number="56">Wherever he went, in the countryside, villages, or towns, they placed the sick on mats in the streets or in public places and begged him, saying, “Just let us touch the tassel of your prayer shawl!” And all who touched him were instantly healed!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">One day, the Pharisees and certain religious scholars came from Jerusalem and gathered around Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They were shocked to find that some of Jesus’ disciples ate bread without first observing the Jewish ritual of hand washing before eating their meal.</verse>
				<verse number="3">(For the Pharisees, like all other Jews, will not eat without first performing a ritual of pouring water over their cupped hands to keep the tradition of the elders.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Similarly, when returning from the marketplace, they ceremonially wash themselves before eating. They also observed many other traditions, such as ceremonially washing cups, pitchers, and kettles.)</verse>
				<verse number="5">So the Pharisees and religious scholars asked Jesus, “Why don’t your disciples live according to the age-old traditions passed down by our elders? They should first ceremonially wash their hands before eating.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus replied, “You are hypocrites! How accurately did Isaiah prophesy about you phonies when he said: ‘These people honor me with their words while their hearts run far away from me!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Their worship is nothing more than a charade! For they continue to insist that their man-made traditions are equal to the instructions of God.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">“You abandon God’s commandments just to keep men’s rituals, such as ceremonially washing utensils, cups, and other things.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then he added, “How skillful you’ve become in rejecting God’s law in order to maintain your man-made set of rules.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For example, Moses taught us: ‘Honor your father and mother,’ and, ‘Whoever insults or mistreats his father or mother must be put to death.’</verse>
				<verse number="11">“But your made-up rules allow a person to say to his parents, ‘I’ve decided to take the support you were counting on from me and make it my holy offering to God, and that will be your blessing instead.’</verse>
				<verse number="12">How convenient! The rules you teach exempt him from providing for his aged parents.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Do you really think God will honor your traditions passed down to others, making up rules that nullify God’s Word? And you’re doing many other similar things.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Jesus called the crowd together again, saying, “Hear my words, all of you, and take them to heart.</verse>
				<verse number="15">What truly contaminates a person is not what he puts into his body, but what comes out. That’s what makes a person defiled.”</verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">When Jesus went back home and away from the crowd, his disciples acknowledged that they didn’t understand the meaning of the parable and asked him to explain it.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He answered them, “Are you as dull as the rest? Don’t you understand that you are not defiled by what you eat?</verse>
				<verse number="19">For the food you swallow doesn’t enter your heart, but goes into your stomach, only to pass out into the sewer.” (This means all foods are clean.)</verse>
				<verse number="20">He added, “Words and deeds pollute a person, not food.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Evil originates from inside a person. Coming out of a human heart are evil schemes, sexual immorality, theft, murder,</verse>
				<verse number="22">adultery, greed, wickedness, treachery, debauchery, jealousy, slander, arrogance, and recklessness.</verse>
				<verse number="23">All these corrupt things emerge from within and constantly defile a person.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Jesus set out from there to go into the non-Jewish region of Tyre. He intended to slip into a house unnoticed, but people found out that he was there.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But when a woman whose daughter had a demon spirit heard he was there, she came and threw herself down at his feet.</verse>
				<verse number="26">She was not Jewish, but a foreigner, born in the part of Syria known as Phoenicia. She begged him repeatedly to cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Finally he said to her, “First let my children be fed and satisfied, for it isn’t fair to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">She answered, “How true that is, Lord. But even puppies under the family table are allowed to eat the little children’s crumbs.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then Jesus said to her, “That’s a good reply! Now, because you said this, you may go. The demon has permanently left your daughter.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">And when she returned home, she found her daughter resting quietly on the couch, completely set free from the demon!</verse>
				<verse number="31">After this, Jesus left the coastland of Tyre and came through Sidon on his way to Lake Galilee and over into regions of Syria.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Some people brought to him a deaf man with a severe speech impediment. They pleaded with Jesus to place his hands on him and heal him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">So Jesus led him away from the crowd to a private spot. Then he stuck his fingers into the man’s ears and placed some of his saliva on the man’s tongue.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then he gazed into heaven, sighed deeply, and spoke to the man’s ears and tongue, “Ethpathakh,” which is Aramaic for “Open up, now!”</verse>
				<verse number="35">At once the man’s ears opened and he could hear perfectly, and his tongue was untied and he began to speak normally.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Jesus ordered everyone to keep this miracle a secret, but the more he told them not to, the more the news spread!</verse>
				<verse number="37">The people were absolutely beside themselves and astonished beyond measure. And they began to declare, “Everything he does is wonderful! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">During those days, another massive crowd gathered to hear Jesus, and again, there was no food and the people were hungry. So Jesus called his disciples to come near him and said to them,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“My heart goes out to this crowd, for they’ve already been here with me for three days with nothing to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I’m concerned that if I send them home hungry, some may faint along the way, for many have come a long, long way just to be with me.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">His disciples replied, “But could anyone possibly get enough food to satisfy a crowd this size out here in this isolated place?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">He asked them, “How many loaves of flatbread do you have?” “Seven,” they replied.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus instructed the crowd to sit down on the grass. After he took the seven loaves, he gave thanks to God, broke them, and started handing them to his disciples. They kept distributing the bread until they had served the entire crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They also had a few small fish, and after giving thanks for these, Jesus had his disciples serve them to the crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Everyone ate until they were satisfied. Then the disciples gathered up the broken pieces and filled seven large baskets with the leftovers.</verse>
				<verse number="9">About four thousand people ate what had been multiplied! Then he dismissed the crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Afterward, Jesus got into a boat and sailed to the vicinity of Dalmanutha.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As soon as Jesus landed, he was confronted by the Pharisees, who argued with Jesus and tested him. They demanded that he give them a miraculous sign from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="12">With a deep sigh from his spirit, he said, “What drives this generation to clamor for a sign? Listen to the truth: there will absolutely be no sign given to this generation!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then he turned and left them, got back into the boat, and crossed over to the opposite shore.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now, the disciples had forgotten to take bread with them, except for one loaf of flatbread.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And as they were sailing across the lake, Jesus repeatedly warned them, “Be on your guard against the yeast inside of the Pharisees and the yeast inside of Herod!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But the disciples had no clue what Jesus was talking about, so they began to discuss it among themselves, saying, “Is he saying this because we forgot to bring bread?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Knowing what they were thinking, Jesus said to them, “Why all this fussing over forgetting to bring bread? Do you still not see or understand what I say to you? Are your hearts still hard?</verse>
				<verse number="18">You have good eyes, yet you still don’t see, and you have good ears, yet you still don’t hear, neither do you remember.</verse>
				<verse number="19">When I multiplied the bread to feed more than five thousand people, how many baskets full of leftovers did you gather afterward?” “Twelve,” they replied.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“And when I multiplied food to feed over four thousand, how many large baskets full of leftovers did you gather afterwards?” “Seven,” they replied.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Then how is it that you still don’t get it?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">When they arrived at Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus, begging him to touch him and heal him.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So Jesus led him, as his sighted guide, outside the village. He placed his saliva on the man’s eyes and covered them with his hands. Then he asked him, “Now do you see anything?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Yes,” he said. “My sight is coming back! I’m beginning to see people, but they look like trees—walking trees.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus put his hands over the man’s eyes a second time and made him look up. The man opened his eyes wide and he could see everything perfectly. His eyesight was completely restored!</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then Jesus sent him home with these instructions: “Go home, but don’t tell anyone what happened, not even the people of your own village.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then Jesus and his disciples walked to the villages near Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he posed this question to his disciples: “Who do the people say that I am?”</verse>
				<verse number="28">They replied, “Some say John the Baptizer, others say Elijah the prophet, and still others say you must be one of the prophets.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">He asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter spoke up, saying, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the Living God!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then he warned them not to breathe a word of this to anyone.</verse>
				<verse number="31">From then on, Jesus began to tell his disciples that he, the Son of Man, was destined to go to Jerusalem and suffer great injustice from the elders, leading priests, and religious scholars. He also explained that he would be killed and three days later be raised to life again.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Jesus opened his heart and spoke freely with his disciples, explaining all these things to them. Then Peter took him aside and rebuked him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But Jesus turned around, and glancing at all of the other disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, “Get out of my sight, Satan! For your heart is not set on God’s plan but man’s!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus had his disciples and the crowd gather around him. And he said to them: “If you truly want to follow me, you should at once completely disown your own life. And you must be willing to share my cross and experience it as your own, as you continually surrender to my ways.</verse>
				<verse number="35">For if you let your life go for my sake and for the sake of the gospel, you will continually experience true life. But if you choose to keep your life for yourself, you will forfeit what you try to keep.</verse>
				<verse number="36">For what use is it to gain all the wealth and power of this world, with everything it could offer you, at the cost of your own life?</verse>
				<verse number="37">And what could be more valuable to you than your own soul?</verse>
				<verse number="38">If you are ashamed of me and my words while living among sinful and faithless people, then I, the Son of Man, will also be ashamed of you when I make my appearance with my holy messengers in the glorious splendor of my Father!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, there are some standing here now who won’t experience death until they see God’s kingdom realm manifest with power!”</verse>
				<verse number="2">After six days, Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John, and hiked up a high mountain to be alone. And Jesus’ appearance was dramatically altered, for he was transfigured before their very eyes!</verse>
				<verse number="3">His clothing sparkled and became glistening white—whiter than any bleach in the world could make them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then suddenly, right in front of them, Moses and Elijah appeared, and they spoke with Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Peter blurted out, “Good Teacher, this is so amazing to see the three of you together! Why don’t we stay here and set up three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">(For all of the disciples were in total fear, and Peter didn’t have a clue what to say.)</verse>
				<verse number="7">Just then, a radiant cloud began to spread over them, enveloping them all. And God’s voice suddenly spoke from the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son and you need to always listen to him!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then suddenly, as they looked around, they saw only Jesus with them, for Moses and Elijah had faded away.</verse>
				<verse number="9">As they all hiked down the mountain together, Jesus ordered them, “Don’t tell anyone of what you just witnessed. Wait until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So they kept it to themselves, puzzled over what Jesus meant about rising from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then they asked him, “Why do the religious scholars insist that Elijah must come before the Messiah?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">He answered them, “They’re right. Elijah must come first to put everything in order. And what about all that is written about the Son of Man? It is true that he must endure many sufferings and be rejected.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So Elijah has already appeared, just as it was prophesied, and they did to him whatever they pleased.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now when they came down the mountain to the other nine disciples, they noticed a large crowd of people gathered around them, with the religious scholars arguing with them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The crowd was astonished to see Jesus himself walking toward them, so they immediately ran to welcome him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“What are you arguing about with the religious scholars?” he asked them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">A man spoke up out of the crowd. “Teacher,” he said, “I have a son possessed by a demon that makes him mute. I brought him here to you, Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Whenever the demon takes control of him, it knocks him down, and he foams at the mouth and gnashes his teeth, and his body becomes stiff as a board. I brought him to your disciples, hoping they could deliver him, but they were not able to do it.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus said to the crowd, “Why are you such a faithless people? How much longer must I remain with you and put up with your unbelief? Now, bring the boy to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">So they brought him to Jesus. As soon as the demon saw him, it threw the boy into convulsions. He fell to the ground, rolling around and foaming at the mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus turned to the father and asked, “How long has your son been tormented like this?” “Since childhood,” he replied.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“It tries over and over to kill him by throwing him into fire or into the water. But please, if you’re able to do something, anything—have compassion on us and help us!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus said to him, “What do you mean ‘if’? If you are able to believe, all things are possible to the believer.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">When he heard this, the boy’s father cried out with tears, saying, “I do believe, Lord; help my little faith!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now when Jesus saw that the crowd was quickly growing larger, he commanded the demon, saying, “Deaf and mute spirit, I command you to come out of him and never enter him again!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">The demon shrieked and threw the boy into terrible seizures and finally came out of him! As the boy lay there, looking like a corpse, everyone thought he was dead.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But Jesus stooped down, gently took his hand, and raised him up to his feet, and he stood there completely set free!</verse>
				<verse number="28">Afterwards, when Jesus arrived at the house, his disciples asked him in private, “Why couldn’t we cast out the demon?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">He answered them, “This type of powerful spirit can only be cast out by fasting and prayer.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">They went on from there and walked through the region of Galilee. Jesus didn’t want the people to know he was there, because he wanted to teach his disciples in private.</verse>
				<verse number="31">He said to them, “The Son of Man is destined to be betrayed and turned over to those who will execute him. But after three days he will rise again.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">But the disciples didn’t have a clue what he meant and were too embarrassed to ask him to explain it.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then they came to Capernaum. And as soon as Jesus was inside the house, he asked his disciples, “What were you arguing about on the way here?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">No one said a word, because they had been arguing about which one of them was the greatest.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Jesus sat down, called the twelve disciples to come around him, and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be content to be last and become a servant to all.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then he had a child come and stand among them. He wrapped the child in his arms and said to them,</verse>
				<verse number="37">“Whoever welcomes a little child in my name welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me welcomes not only me, but the one who sent me.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">John spoke up and said, “Teacher, we noticed someone was using your name to cast out demons, so we tried to stop him because he wasn’t one of our group.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">“Don’t stop him!” Jesus replied. “For the one who does miracles in the power of my name proves he is not my enemy.</verse>
				<verse number="40">And whoever is not against us is for us.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Listen to the truth that I speak: Whoever gives you a cup of water because you carry the name of Christ will never lose his reward.</verse>
				<verse number="42">But if anyone abuses one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for him to have a heavy boulder tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea than to face the punishment he deserves!</verse>
				<verse number="43">“If your hand entices you to sin, let it go limp and useless! For it is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have your entire body thrown into hell, the place of unquenchable fire.</verse>
				<verse number="44">This is where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out.</verse>
				<verse number="45">And if your foot leads you into sin, cut it off! For it is better to enter life crawling than to have both feet and be flung into hell.</verse>
				<verse number="46">This is where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out.</verse>
				<verse number="47">And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out! For it is better to enter into life with one eye than to be thrown into hell with two.</verse>
				<verse number="48">This is where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out!</verse>
				<verse number="49">“Everyone will pass through the fire and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.</verse>
				<verse number="50">Salt is excellent for seasoning. But if salt becomes tasteless, how can its flavor ever be restored? Your lives, like salt, are to season and preserve. So don’t lose your flavor, and preserve the peace in your union with one another.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Then Jesus left the region and went into the district of Judea, across from the Jordan River, and again, massive crowds flocked to him, and Jesus, as was his custom, began to teach the people.</verse>
				<verse number="2">At one point, some of the Pharisees came, seeking to entrap him with a question. “Tell us,” they asked, “is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”</verse>
				<verse number="3">He answered them, “What did Moses command you?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">They replied, “Moses permitted us to write a certificate of separation that would be valid to complete a divorce.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Jesus said, “Yes, Moses wrote this exception for you because you are hardhearted.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But from the beginning God created male and female.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For this reason a man will leave his parents and be wedded to his wife.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And the husband and wife will be joined as one flesh, and after that they no longer exist as two, but one flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So there you have it. What God has joined together, no one has the right to split apart.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Once indoors, his disciples asked him to explain it to them again.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So he said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And if the wife divorces her husband and marries another, she also commits adultery.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">The parents kept bringing their little children to Jesus so that he would lay his hands on them and bless them. But the disciples kept rebuking and scolding the people for doing it.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When Jesus saw what was happening, he became indignant with his disciples and said to them, “Let all the little children come to me and never hinder them! Don’t you know that God’s kingdom exists for such as these?</verse>
				<verse number="15">Listen to the truth I speak: Whoever does not open their arms to receive God’s kingdom like a teachable child will never enter it.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then he embraced each child, and laying his hands on them, he lovingly blessed each one.</verse>
				<verse number="17">As Jesus started on his way, a man came running up to him. Kneeling down in front of him, he cried out, “Good Teacher, what one thing am I required to do to gain eternal life?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Jesus responded, “Why do you call me good? Only God is truly good.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You already know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give a false testimony, do not cheat, and honor your father and mother.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="20">The man said to Jesus, “Teacher, I have carefully obeyed these laws since my youth.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus fixed his gaze upon the man, with tender love, and said to him, “Yet there is still one thing in you lacking. Go, sell all that you have and give the money to the poor. Then all of your treasure will be in heaven. After you’ve done this, come back and walk with me.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Completely shocked by Jesus’ answer, he turned and walked away very sad, for he was extremely rich.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus looked at the faces of his disciples and said, “How hard it is for the wealthy to enter into God’s kingdom realm.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">The disciples were startled when they heard this. But Jesus again said to them, “Children, it is next to impossible for those who trust in their riches to find their way into God’s kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="25">It is easier to stuff a rope through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to enter into God’s kingdom.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">But this left them all the more astonished, and they whispered to one another, “Then who could ever be saved?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Jesus looked at them and replied, “With people it is impossible, but not with God—God makes all things possible!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then Peter spoke up and said, “Can’t you see that we’ve left everything we had to cling to you?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Listen to my words,” Jesus said. “Anyone who leaves his home behind and chooses me over children, parents, family, and possessions, all for the sake of the gospel,</verse>
				<verse number="30">it will come back to him a hundred times as much in this lifetime—homes, family, mothers, brothers, sisters, children, possessions—along with persecutions. And in the age to come, he will inherit eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="31">But many who are considered to be the most important now will be the least important then. And many who are viewed as the least important now will be considered the most important then.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Jesus and his disciples were on the road that went up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was leading them forward. The disciples were filled with wonder and amazement at his bravery, but those following along with them were very afraid. As they approached the city, he took the Twelve aside privately and told them what was going to happen.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“I want you to know that we are going to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be handed over to the ruling priests and religious scholars and they will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Romans.</verse>
				<verse number="34">And they will mock him, spit in his face, torture him, and kill him, but three days later he will rise again.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Jacob and John, sons of Zebedee, approached Jesus and said, “Teacher, will you do us a favor?”</verse>
				<verse number="36">“What is it?” he asked.</verse>
				<verse number="37">“We want to sit next to you when you come into your glory,” they said, “one at your right hand and the other at your left.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Jesus replied, “You don’t have a clue what you’re asking for! Are you prepared to drink from the cup of suffering that I am about to drink? And are you able to endure the baptism into death that I am about to experience?”</verse>
				<verse number="39">They replied, “Yes, we are able.” Jesus said to them, “You will certainly drink from the cup of my sufferings and be immersed into my death,</verse>
				<verse number="40">but to have you sit in the position of highest honor is not mine to decide. It is reserved for those especially prepared to have it.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Now the other ten disciples overheard this, and they became angry and began to criticize Jacob and John.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Jesus gathered them all together and said to them, “Those recognized as rulers of the people and those who are in top leadership positions rule oppressively over their subjects, but this is not the example you are to follow.</verse>
				<verse number="43">You are to lead by a different model. If you want to be the greatest, then live as one called to serve others.</verse>
				<verse number="44">The path to promotion comes by having the heart of a bond-slave who serves everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="45">For even the Son of Man did not come expecting to be served by everyone, but to serve everyone, and to give his life as the ransom price for the salvation of many.”</verse>
				<verse number="46">When Jesus and his disciples had passed through Jericho, a large crowd joined them. Upon leaving the village, they met a blind beggar sitting on the side of the road named Timai, the son of Timai.</verse>
				<verse number="47">When he heard that Jesus from Nazareth was passing by, he began to shout “Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me now in my affliction. Heal me!”</verse>
				<verse number="48">Those in the crowd were indignant and scolded him for making so much of a disturbance, but he kept shouting with all his might, “Son of David, have mercy on me now and heal me!”</verse>
				<verse number="49">Jesus stopped and said, “Call him here.” So they went to the blind man and said, “Have courage! Get up! Jesus is calling for you!”</verse>
				<verse number="50">So he threw off his beggars’ cloak, jumped up, and made his way to Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The man replied, “My Master, please, let me see again!”</verse>
				<verse number="52">Jesus responded, “Your faith heals you. Go in peace, with your sight restored.” All at once, the man’s eyes opened and he could see again, and he began at once to follow Jesus, walking down the road with him.</verse>

			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Now, as they were approaching Jerusalem, they arrived at the place of the stables near Bethany on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead</verse>
				<verse number="2">and said to them, “As soon as you enter the village ahead, you will find a donkey’s colt tied there that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And if anyone asks, ‘Why are you taking it?’ tell them, ‘The master needs it and will send it back to you soon.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So they went and found the colt outside in the street, tied to a gate. When they started to untie it,</verse>
				<verse number="5">some people standing there said to them, “Why are you untying that colt?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">They answered just as Jesus had told them: “The master needs it, and he will send it back to you soon.” So the bystanders let them go.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The disciples brought the colt to Jesus and piled their cloaks and prayer shawls on the young donkey, and Jesus rode upon it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Many people carpeted the road in front of him with their cloaks and prayer shawls, while others gathered palm branches and spread them before him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus rode in the center of the procession, with crowds going before him and behind him. They all shouted in celebration, “Bring the victory! We welcome the one coming with blessings sent from the Lord Yahweh!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Blessings rest on this kingdom he ushers in—the kingdom of our father David! Bring us the victory in the highest realms of heaven!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Jesus rode through the gates of Jerusalem and up to the temple. After looking around at everything, he left for Bethany with the Twelve to spend the night, for it was already late in the day.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The next day, as he left Bethany, Jesus was feeling hungry.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He noticed a leafy fig tree in the distance, so he walked over to see if there was any fruit on it, but there was none—only leaves (for it wasn’t yet the season for bearing figs).</verse>
				<verse number="14">Jesus spoke to the fig tree, saying, “No one will ever eat fruit from you again!” And the disciples overheard him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When they came into Jerusalem, Jesus went directly into the temple area and overturned all the tables and benches of the merchants who were doing business there. One by one he drove them all out of the temple courts, and they scattered away, including the money changers and those selling doves.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And he would not allow them to use the temple courts as a thoroughfare for carrying their merchandise and their furniture.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then he began to teach the people, saying, “Does not the Scripture say, ‘My house will be a house of prayer for all the world to share’? But you have made it a hangout of thieves!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">When the chief priests and religious scholars heard this, they began to hatch a plot as to how they could eliminate Jesus. But they feared him and his influence, because the entire crowd was totally captivated by his teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="19">So he and his disciples spent the nights outside the city.</verse>
				<verse number="20">In the morning, they passed by the fig tree that Jesus spoke to and it was completely withered from the roots up.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Peter remembered and said to him, “Teacher, look! That’s the fig tree you cursed. It’s now all shriveled up and dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Jesus replied, “Let the faith of God be in you!</verse>
				<verse number="23">Listen to the truth I speak to you: Whoever says to this mountain with great faith and does not doubt, ‘Mountain, be lifted up and thrown into the midst of the sea,’ and believes that what he says will happen, it will be done.</verse>
				<verse number="24">This is the reason I urge you to boldly believe for whatever you ask for in prayer—be convinced that you have received it and it will be yours.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And whenever you stand praying, if you find that you carry something in your heart against another person, release him and forgive him so that your Father in heaven will also release you and forgive you of your faults.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But if you will not release forgiveness, don’t expect your Father in heaven to release you from your misdeeds.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">They came again into Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the Jewish rulers—the chief priest, certain religious scholars, and the elders—approached him. They came up to him</verse>
				<verse number="28">and asked, “What right do you have to say and do these things? Who gave you the authority to do all this?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus replied, “I too have a question to ask you. If you can answer this question, then I will tell you by what power I do all these things.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Where did John’s authority to immerse come from? Was it from heaven or from people? Answer me now.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">They stepped away and debated among themselves, saying, “How should we answer this? If we say, ‘from heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Then why didn’t you respond to John and believe what he said?’</verse>
				<verse number="32">But if we say, ‘from the people,’ we fear the crowds, for they’re convinced that John was God’s prophet.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">So they finally answered, “We don’t know.” “Then neither will I tell you where my power comes from to do these things,” Jesus replied.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Then Jesus began to speak to them in parables: “There once was a man who planted a vineyard and put a secure fence around it. He dug a pit for its winepress and erected a watch tower. Then he leased it to tenant-farmers and traveled abroad.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When the time of harvest came, he sent one of his servants to the tenants to collect the landowners’ share of the harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But the tenants seized him and beat him and sent him back empty-handed.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So the owner sent another servant to them. And that one they shamefully humiliated and beat over the head.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So he sent another servant, and they brutally killed him. Many more servants were sent, and they were all severely beaten or killed.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The owner had only one person left to send—his only son, whom he dearly loved. So he sent him to them, saying, ‘Surely they will restrain themselves and respect my son.’</verse>
				<verse number="7">But the tenants saw their chance and said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come! Let’s kill him, and then we’ll inherit it all!’</verse>
				<verse number="8">So they violently seized him, killed him, and threw his body over the fence!</verse>
				<verse number="9">So what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? He will come and put to death those tenants and give his vineyard to others.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Haven’t you read what the psalmist said? The stone the builders examined and rejected has become the cornerstone, the most important stone of all?</verse>
				<verse number="11">This was the Lord’s plan— and he is wonderful for our eyes to behold!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now, the chief priests, religious scholars, and leaders realized that Jesus’ parable was aimed at them. They had hoped to arrest him then and there, but they feared the reaction of the crowd, so they left him alone and went away.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then they sent a delegation of Pharisees, together with some staunch supporters of Herod, to entrap Jesus with his own words.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So they approached him and said, “Teacher, we know that you’re an honest man of integrity and you teach us the truth of God’s ways. We can clearly see that you’re not one who speaks only to win the people’s favor, because you speak the truth without regard to the consequences. So tell us, then, what you think. Is it proper for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said to them, “Why are you testing me? Show me one of the Roman coins.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">They brought him a silver coin used to pay the tax. “Now, tell me,” Jesus said, “whose head is on this coin and whose inscription is stamped on it?” “Caesar’s,” they replied.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus said, “ Precisely. The coin bears the image of the emperor Caesar, so you should pay the emperor his portion. But because you bear the image of God, you must give to God all that belongs to him.” And they were utterly stunned by Jesus’ words.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Some of the Sadducees, a religious group that denied there was a resurrection of the dead, came to ask Jesus this question:</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Teacher, the law of Moses teaches that if a man dies before he has children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother’s family line.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now, there was a family with seven brothers. The oldest got married but soon died, and he had no children.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The second brother married his oldest brother’s widow, and he also died without any children, and the third also.</verse>
				<verse number="22">This repeated down to the seventh brother, none of whom had children. Finally, the woman died.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So here’s our dilemma: Which of the seven brothers will be the woman’s husband when she’s resurrected from the dead, since they all were once married to her?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Jesus answered them, “You are mistaken because your hearts are not filled with the revelation of the Scriptures or the power of God.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For when they rise from the dead, men and women will not marry, just like the angels of heaven don’t marry.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Now, concerning the resurrection, haven’t you read in the Torah what God said to Moses at the burning bush? ‘I AM the living God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</verse>
				<verse number="27">God is not God of the dead, but of the living, and you are all badly mistaken!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Now a certain religious scholar overheard them debating. When he saw how beautifully Jesus answered all their questions, he posed one of his own, and asked him, “Teacher, which commandment is the greatest of all?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus answered him, “The most important of all the commandments is this: ‘The Lord Yahweh, our God, is one!’</verse>
				<verse number="30">You are to love the Lord Yahweh, your God, with a passionate heart, from the depths of your soul, with your every thought, and with all your strength. This is the great and supreme commandment.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And the second is this: ‘You must love your neighbor in the same way you love yourself.’ You will never find a greater commandment than these.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">The religious scholar replied, “Yes, that’s true, Teacher. You spoke beautifully when you said that God is one, and there is no one else besides him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">And there is something more important to God than all the sacrifices and burnt offerings: it’s the commandment to constantly love God with every passion of your heart, with your every thought, and with all your strength—and to love your neighbor in the same way as you love yourself.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">When Jesus noticed how thoughtfully and sincerely the man answered, he said to him, “You’re not far from the reality of God’s kingdom.” After that, no one dared to question him again.</verse>
				<verse number="35">While Jesus was teaching in the courts of the temple, he posed a question to those listening: “Why do the religious scholars say that the Messiah is David’s son?</verse>
				<verse number="36">Yet it was David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, who sang: Yahweh said to my Lord, ‘Sit near me in the place of authority until I subdue all your enemies under Your feet.’</verse>
				<verse number="37">Since David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?” The large crowd listened to him with delight.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Jesus also taught the people, “Beware of the religious scholars. They love to parade around in their clergy robes and be greeted with respect on the street.</verse>
				<verse number="39">They crave to be made the leaders of synagogue councils, and they push their way to the head table at banquets.</verse>
				<verse number="40">For appearance’s sake, they will pray long religious prayers at the homes of widows for an offering, cheating them out of their very livelihood. Beware of them all, for they will one day be stripped of honor, and the judgment they receive will be severe.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Then he sat down near the offering box, watching all the people dropping in their coins. Many of the rich would put in very large sums,</verse>
				<verse number="42">but a destitute widow walked up and dropped in two small copper coins, worth less than a penny.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Jesus called his disciples to gather around and then said to them, “I tell you the truth, this poor widow has given a larger offering than any of the wealthy.</verse>
				<verse number="44">For the rich only gave out of their surplus, but she sacrificed out of her poverty and gave to God all that she had to live on, which was everything she had.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">As Jesus was leaving the temple courts, one of his disciples came to him and said, “Teacher, look at these magnificent buildings! And what tremendous stones were used to build all this!”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Jesus turned to them and said, “Take a good look at all these enormous buildings, for I’m telling you, there will not be one stone left upon another. It will all be leveled!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Later, while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, overlooking the temple, his disciples, Peter, Jacob, John, and Andrew, came to him privately where he was sitting and said,</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what supernatural sign should we expect to signal your coming and the completion of this age?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Jesus answered, “At that time deception will run rampant. So beware that you’re not fooled!</verse>
				<verse number="6">For many will appear on the scene claiming my authority or saying about themselves, ‘I am God’s Anointed,’ and they will lead many astray.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You will hear rumors of wars nearby, with more rumors of wars to come. Make sure that you are not thrown into a panic or give in to your fears, for these things are destined to happen. Prepare for it, but still the end is not yet.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For nations will go to war against each other and kingdoms will clash with kingdoms. And there will be terrible earthquakes in place after place—seismic events of epic proportion. And there will be famines and riots. This is how the first contractions and birth pains of the new age will begin.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Be on your guard! For they will hand you over to the ruling councils, and you will be beaten in public gatherings. And you will stand trial before kings and high-ranking governmental leaders as an opportunity to testify to them on my behalf.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But prior to the end of the age, the hope of the gospel must first be preached to all nations.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“So when they put you under arrest and hand you over for trial, don’t even give one thought about what you will say. Simply speak what the Holy Spirit gives you at that very moment. And realize that it won’t be you speaking but the Holy Spirit speaking through you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Brothers will betray each other unto death—even a father his child. Children will rise up to take a stand against their parents and have them put to death.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Expect to be hated by all because of your allegiance to my name. But determine to be faithful to the end and you will be saved.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“When you witness what Daniel prophesied, ‘the disgusting destroyer,’ standing where it must not be [Let the reader learn what it means], then those in the land of Judah must escape to higher ground.</verse>
				<verse number="15">On that day, if you happen to be outside, don’t go back inside to gather your belongings.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And if you’re working out in the field, don’t run back home to get a coat.</verse>
				<verse number="17">It will be especially hard for pregnant women and for those nursing their babies when those days come.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So pray that your escape will not be during the winter months.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For this will be a time of great misery beyond the magnitude of anything the world has ever seen from the beginning of time or ever will see.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Unless God limits those days, no one would escape. But because of his love for his chosen ones, he will shorten that time of trouble.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“And if you hear reports from people, saying, ‘Look, the Messiah is over here,’ or, ‘The Messiah is over there!’ don’t believe it.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For there will be imposters falsely claiming to be God’s ‘Anointed One.’ And false prophets will arise to perform miracle signs, and if it were possible, they would cause God’s chosen ones to wander off the right track.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Be alert, for I prophesy all this will happen!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">“This is what will take place after that suffering: The sun will be darkened and the moon will reflect no light.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The stars will be falling from the sky and all the cosmic powers will be shaken.</verse>
				<verse number="26">“Then they will see the Son of Man appearing in the midst of clouds and revealed with mighty power and great glory.</verse>
				<verse number="27">At that time he will send his messengers to gather together his beloved chosen ones from every direction—from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Now, learn the lesson from the parable of the fig tree. When spring arrives, and it sends out its tender branches and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So also, when you observe all these things progressively taking place, you will know that he is near, even at the door!</verse>
				<verse number="30">I assure you, this family will not pass away until all I have spoken comes to pass.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The earth and sky will wear out and fade away before one word I speak loses its power or fails to accomplish its purpose.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">“Concerning that day and exact hour, no one knows when it will arrive, not the angels of heaven, not even the Son—only the Father knows.</verse>
				<verse number="33">This is why you must be waiting, watching and praying, because no one knows when that season of time will come.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">“For those days can be compared to a man who was about to leave on a journey, but before leaving he placed his servants in charge and gave each one work to do while he was away. Then he commanded the watchman to be on guard at all times.</verse>
				<verse number="35">So I say to you, keep awake and alert—for you have no idea when the master of the house will return; in the evening, at midnight, at four o’clock in the morning, or at dawn.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Be alert, for he’s coming suddenly and may find you sleeping!</verse>
				<verse number="37">And what I say to the four of you, I say to everyone—be awake at all times!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">Two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the leading priests and religious scholars were committed to finding a way to secretly arrest Jesus and have him executed.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They agreed that their plot could not succeed if they carried it out during the days of the feast, for they said, “There could be a riot among the people.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now Jesus was in Bethany, in the home of Simon, a man Jesus had healed of leprosy. And as he was reclining at the table, a woman came into the house, with an alabaster flask filled with the highest quality of fragrant and expensive oil. She came to Jesus, and with a gesture of extreme devotion, she broke the flask and poured out the precious oil over his head.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But some were highly indignant when they saw this, and they complained to one another, saying, “What a total waste!</verse>
				<verse number="5">It could have been sold for a great sum, and the money could have benefited the poor.” So they scolded her harshly.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus said to them, “Leave her alone! Why are you so critical of this woman? She has honored me with this beautiful act of kindness.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You will always have the poor, whom you can help whenever you want, but you will not always have me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">When she poured the fragrant oil over me, she was preparing my body in advance of my burial. She has done all that she could to honor me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I promise you that as this wonderful gospel spreads all over the world, the story of her lavish devotion to me will be mentioned in memory of her.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">One of the twelve apostles, Judas Iscariot, went to the leading priests to inform them of his willingness to betray Jesus into their hands.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They were delighted to hear this and agreed to pay him for it. So immediately Judas began to look for the right opportunity to betray him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover Lamb is sacrificed, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where would you like us to prepare the Passover meal for you?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So he sent two of his disciples ahead into Jerusalem with these instructions: “Make your way into the city and watch for a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,</verse>
				<verse number="14">and say to the owner of whatever house he enters, ‘The Teacher wants to ask you: “Do you have my room ready where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?” ’</verse>
				<verse number="15">And he will show you a large upstairs room ready and with a table set. Make preparations for us there.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So they went into the city and found everything to be exactly like Jesus had prophesied, and they prepared for him the Passover meal.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And when evening came, he entered the house and went upstairs with his twelve disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Over dinner, while they were reclining around the table, Jesus said, “Listen to the truth: One of you eating here with me is about to betray me.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Feeling deeply troubled by these words, one after another asked him, “Is it I?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">He answered, “It is one of you twelve who has shared meals with me as an intimate friend.</verse>
				<verse number="21">All that was prophesied of me, the Son of Man, is destined to soon take place, but it will be disastrous for the one who betrays the Son of Man. It would be far better for him if he had never been born!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">As they were dining, Jesus took the bread and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to his disciples. He said to them, “Receive this; it is my body.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then taking the cup of wine and giving thanks to the Father, he declared the new covenant with them. And as each one drank from the cup,</verse>
				<verse number="24">he said to them, “This is my blood, which seals the new covenant poured out for many.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the day comes when we drink it together in the kingdom feast of my Father.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then they sang a psalm and afterwards left for the Mount of Olives.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away and desert me. This will fulfill the prophecy of the Scripture that says: I will strike down the shepherd and all the sheep will scatter.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“But after I am risen, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then Peter spoke up and said, “Even if all the rest lose their faith and fall away, I will still be beside you!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Jesus said, “Mark my words, Peter. This very night, before the rooster crows twice a few hours from now, you will deny that you know me three times.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">But Peter was insistent and replied emphatically, “I will absolutely not! Under no circumstances will I ever deny you—even if I have to die with you!” And all the others repeated the same thing.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then Jesus led his disciples to an orchard called “The Oil Press.” He told them, “Sit here while I pray awhile.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">He took Peter, Jacob, and John with him. An intense feeling of great horror plunged his soul into deep sorrow.</verse>
				<verse number="34">And he said to them, “My heart is overwhelmed with anguish and crushed with grief. It feels as though I’m dying. Stay here and keep watch with me.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">He walked a short distance away, and being overcome with grief, he threw himself facedown on the ground. He prayed that if it were possible, he would not have to experience this hour of suffering.</verse>
				<verse number="36">He prayed, “Abba, my Father, all things are possible for you. Please—remove this cup of suffering! Yet what I want is not important, for I only desire to fulfill your plan for me.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Then he came back to his three disciples and found them all sound asleep. He awakened Peter and said to him, “Simon, are you asleep? Do you lack the strength to stay awake with me for even just an hour?</verse>
				<verse number="38">Keep alert and pray that you’ll be spared from this time of testing. For your spirit is eager enough, but your humanity is feeble.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Then he left them a second time and went to pray the same thing.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Afterward, he came back to the disciples and found them sound asleep, for they couldn’t keep their eyes open and they didn’t know what to say to him.</verse>
				<verse number="41">After praying for the third time, he returned to his disciples and awoke them again, saying, “Do you plan on sleeping and resting indefinitely? That’s enough sleep! The end has come and the hour has arrived for the Son of Man to be handed over to the authority of sinful men.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Get up and let’s go. Don’t you see? My betrayer draws near.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">At that moment Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, along with a large crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent to arrest Jesus by order of the ruling priests, the religious scholars, and the Jewish leaders.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Now, Judas, the traitor, had arranged to give them a signal that would identify Jesus, for he had told them, “Jesus is the man I will kiss. So arrest him and take him away.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">Judas quickly stepped up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi, my teacher!” and he kissed him on both cheeks.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Then the armed men seized Jesus to arrest him.</verse>
				<verse number="47">One of the disciples pulled out a sword and swung it at the servant of Caiaphas, the high priest, slashing off his ear.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Jesus said to the mob, “Why would you arrest me with swords and clubs as though I were an outlaw?</verse>
				<verse number="49">Day after day I sat with you in the temple courts, teaching the people, yet you didn’t arrest me then. But all of this fulfills the prophecies of the Scriptures.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">At that point all of his disciples ran away and abandoned him.</verse>
				<verse number="51">There was a young man there following Jesus, wearing only a linen sheet wrapped around him.</verse>
				<verse number="52">They tried to arrest him also, but he slipped from their grasp and ran off naked, leaving his linen cloth in their hands.</verse>
				<verse number="53">Those who arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, to a meeting where the religious scholars and Jewish leaders were assembled.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Now, Peter had followed him from a distance all the way to the chief priest’s courtyard. He sat with the guards and was warming himself by the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="55">The chief priests and the Jewish council of leaders were doing their best to find false charges that they could bring against Jesus and condemn him to death, but they could not find any.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Many false witnesses came forward, but the evidence could not be corroborated.</verse>
				<verse number="57">Some came forward and testified against him, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="58">“We heard him say, ‘I can destroy this temple made with hands and then build another one again in three days not made with hands!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="59">Yet even on this point the witnesses did not agree.</verse>
				<verse number="60">Finally, the chief priest stood up in the middle of them and said to Jesus, “Have you nothing to say about these allegations? Is what they’re saying about you true?”</verse>
				<verse number="61">But Jesus remained silent before them and did not answer. So the chief priest said to him, “Are you the anointed Messiah, the Son of the Blessed God?”</verse>
				<verse number="62">Jesus answered him, “I am. And more than that, you are about to see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty and coming in the heavenly clouds!”</verse>
				<verse number="63">Then, as an act of outrage, the high priest tore his robe and shouted, “No more witnesses are needed,</verse>
				<verse number="64">for you’ve heard this grievous blasphemy.” Turning to the council he said, “Now, what is your verdict?” “He’s guilty and deserves the death penalty!” they all answered.</verse>
				<verse number="65">Then they spat on his face and blindfolded him. Others struck him over and over with their fists and taunted him by saying, “Prophesy to us! Tell us which one of us is about to hit you next? ” And the guards took him and beat him.</verse>
				<verse number="66">Meanwhile, Peter was sitting below in the courtyard when a girl, a servant of the high priest, came near the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="67">When she saw Peter there warming himself, she said to him, “I recognize you. You were with that Nazarene, Jesus.”</verse>
				<verse number="68">But Peter denied it, saying, “I don’t have a clue what you’re talking about.” Then he went out to the gateway of the courtyard and the rooster crowed.</verse>
				<verse number="69">When the servant girl noticed him, she said to all the bystanders, “I know this man is one of his followers!”</verse>
				<verse number="70">Once again, Peter denied it. A short time later, the bystanders said to him, “You must be one of them. You’re a Galilean, like he is, for your accent proves it!”</verse>
				<verse number="71">Peter cursed and said, “I tell you, I don’t know this man you’re talking about!”</verse>
				<verse number="72">At the same moment Peter spoke those words, the sound of a rooster crowing pierced the night for the second time. And Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him earlier: “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” With his heart shattered, Peter broke down and sobbed with bitter tears.</verse>

			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Before dawn that morning, the ruling priests, elders, religious scholars, and the entire Jewish council set in motion their plan against Jesus. They bound him in chains, took him away, and handed him over to Pilate.</verse>
				<verse number="2">As Jesus stood in front of the Roman governor, Pilate asked him, “So, are you really the king of the Jews?” Jesus answered, “You have just spoken it.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then the ruling priests, over and over, made bitter accusations against him, but he remained silent.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Pilate questioned him again. “Have you nothing to say? Don’t you hear these many allegations they’re making against you?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But Jesus offered no defense to any of the charges, much to the astonishment of Pilate.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Every year at Passover, it was the custom of the governor to pardon a prisoner and release him to the people—anyone they wanted.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now, Pilate was holding in custody a notorious criminal named Barabbas, one of the assassins who had committed murder in an uprising.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The crowds gathered in front of Pilate’s judgment bench and asked him to release a prisoner to them, as was his custom.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So he asked them, “Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">(Pilate was fully aware that the religious leaders had handed Jesus over to him because of spite and envy.)</verse>
				<verse number="11">But the ruling priests stirred up the crowd to incite them to ask for Barabbas instead.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So Pilate asked them, “What do you want me to do with this one you call the king of the Jews?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">They all shouted back, “Crucify him!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Why?” Pilate asked. “What evil thing has he done wrong to deserve that?” But they kept shouting out with a deafening roar, “Crucify him at once!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Because he wanted to please the people, Pilate released Barabbas to them. After he had Jesus severely beaten with a whip made of leather straps and embedded with metal, he sentenced him to be crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The soldiers took Jesus into the headquarters of the governor’s compound and summoned a military unit of nearly six hundred men.</verse>
				<verse number="17">They placed a purple robe on him to make fun of him. Then they braided a victor’s crown, a wreath made of thorns, and set it on his head.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And with a mock salute they repeatedly cried out, “Hail, your majesty, king of the Jews!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">They spit in his face and hit him repeatedly on his head with a reed staff, driving the crown of thorns deep into his brow. They knelt down before him in mockery, pretending to pay him homage.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When they finished ridiculing him, they took off the purple robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to be crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="21">As they came out of the city, they stopped an African man named Simon, a native of Libya. He was passing by, just coming in from the countryside with his two sons, Alexander and Rufus, and the soldiers forced him to carry the heavy crossbeam for Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="22">They brought Jesus to the execution site called Golgotha, which means “Skull Hill.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">There they offered him a mild painkiller, a drink of wine mixed with gall, but he refused to drink it.</verse>
				<verse number="24">They nailed his hands and feet to the cross. The soldiers divided his clothing among themselves by rolling dice to see who would win them.</verse>
				<verse number="25">It was nine o’clock in the morning when they finally crucified him.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Above his head they placed a sign with the inscription of the charge against him, which read, “This is the King of the Jews.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Two criminals were also crucified with Jesus, one on each side of him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">This fulfilled the Scripture that says: He was considered to be a criminal.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Those who passed by shook their heads and spitefully ridiculed him, saying, “Aha! You boasted that you could destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Why don’t you save yourself now? Just come down from the cross!”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Even the ruling priests and the religious scholars joined in the mockery and kept laughing among themselves, saying, “He saved others, but he can’t even save himself! Israel’s king, is he?</verse>
				<verse number="32">Let the ‘Messiah,’ the ‘king of Israel,’ pull out the nails and come down from the cross right now. We’ll believe it when we see it!” Even the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus began to taunt him, hurling insults on him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">For three hours, beginning at noon, darkness came over the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="34">About three o’clock, Jesus shouted with a mighty voice in Aramaic, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” —that is, “My God, My God, why have you turned your back on me?”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Some who were standing near the cross misunderstood and said, “Listen! He’s calling for Elijah.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">One bystander ran and got a sponge, soaked it with sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Jesus to drink. But the rest said, “Leave him alone! Let’s see if Elijah comes to rescue him.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Just then Jesus passionately cried out with a loud voice and breathed his last.</verse>
				<verse number="38">At that moment the veil in the Holy of Holies was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</verse>
				<verse number="39">When the Roman military officer who was standing right in front of Jesus saw how he died, he said, “There is no doubt this man was the Son of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Watching from a distance, away from the crowds, were many of the women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and had cared for him. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jacob the younger and Joseph, and Salome. Many other women who had followed him to Jerusalem were there too.</verse>
				<verse number="41"></verse>
				<verse number="42">Evening was fast approaching, and it was a preparation day before a Sabbath.</verse>
				<verse number="43">So a prominent Jewish leader named Joseph, from the village of Ramah, courageously went to see Pilate and begged to have custody of the body of Jesus. Joseph was a highly regarded member of the Jewish council and a follower of Jesus who was eagerly awaiting the kingdom of God.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Pilate was amazed to hear that Jesus was already dead, so he summoned the Roman officer, who confirmed it.</verse>
				<verse number="45">After it was confirmed, Pilate consented to give the corpse to Joseph.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Joseph purchased a shroud of fine linen and took the body down from the cross. Then he wrapped it in the linen shroud and placed it in a tomb quarried from out of the rock. Then they rolled a large stone over the entrance to seal the tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph were there and saw exactly where they laid the body of Jesus.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">On the first day of the week, as the Sabbath was ending, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jacob, and Salome made their way to the tomb. It was very early in the morning as the first streaks of light were beginning to be seen in the sky. They had purchased aromatic embalming spices so that they might anoint his body.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">And they had been asking one another, “Who can roll away the heavy stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">But when they arrived, they discovered that the very large stone was already rolled away!</verse>
				<verse number="5">And as they stepped into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, dressed in a long white robe. The women were startled and amazed.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But the angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid. I know that you’re here looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He isn’t here—he has risen victoriously! Look! See the place where they laid him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Run and tell his disciples, even Peter, that he is risen. He has gone ahead of you into Galilee and you will see him there, just like he told you.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">They staggered out of the tomb, awestruck, with their minds swirling. They ran to tell the disciples, but they were so afraid and amazed, they said nothing to anyone.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Early on the first day of the week, after rising from the dead, Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</verse>
				<verse number="10">After she had seen Jesus, she ran to tell his disciples, who were all emotionally devastated and weeping.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Excitedly, Mary told them, “He’s alive and I’ve seen him!” But even after hearing this, they didn’t believe her.</verse>
				<verse number="12">After this, Jesus appeared to two of the disciples, who were on their way to another village, appearing in a form they did not recognize.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They went back to Jerusalem to tell the rest of the disciples, but they didn’t believe it was true.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Jesus appeared before the eleven apostles as they were eating a meal. He corrected them for having such hard, unbelieving hearts because they did not believe those who saw him after his resurrection.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And he said to them, “As you go into all the world, preach openly the wonderful news of the gospel to the entire human race!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Whoever believes the good news and is baptized will be saved, and whoever does not believe the good news will be condemned.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And these miracle signs will accompany those who believe: They will drive out demons in the power of my name. They will speak in tongues.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They will be supernaturally protected from snakes and from drinking anything poisonous. And they will lay hands on the sick and heal them.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">After saying these things, Jesus was lifted up into heaven and sat down at the place of honor at the right hand of God!</verse>
				<verse number="20">And the apostles went out announcing the good news everywhere, as the Lord himself consistently worked with them, validating the message they preached with miracle-signs that accompanied them!</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">I am writing for you, mighty lover of God, an orderly account of what Jesus accomplished and fulfilled among us. Several eyewitness biographies have already been written, using as their source material the good news preached among us by his early disciples, who were from the beginning loving servants of the Living Expression. Now I am passing on to you this accurate compilation of my own meticulous investigation based on numerous eyewitness interviews. It is appropriate for me to write this, for he also appeared to me so that I would reassure you beyond any shadow of a doubt the reliability of all you have been taught of him.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">During the reign of King Herod the Great of Judea, there was a Jewish priest named Zechariah who served in the temple as part of the priestly order of Abijah. His wife, Elizabeth, was also from a family of priests, and was a descendant of Aaron.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They were both righteous before God, living virtuously and following the commandments of the Lord blamelessly.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But they were childless since Elizabeth was barren, and now they both were quite old.</verse>
				<verse number="8">One day, Zechariah’s priestly order was on duty and he was serving as priest. He was chosen by the casting of lots (according to the custom of the priesthood) so the honor fell upon Zechariah to enter the Holy Place and burn incense before the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="9"></verse>
				<verse number="10">A large crowd of worshipers had gathered to pray outside the temple at the hour when incense was being offered.</verse>
				<verse number="11">All at once an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing just to the right of the altar of incense.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Zechariah was startled and overwhelmed with fear.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But the angel reassured him, saying, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah! God is showing grace to you. For I have come to tell you that your prayer for a child has been answered. Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son and you are to name him John.</verse>
				<verse number="14">His birth will bring you much joy and gladness. Many will rejoice because of him,</verse>
				<verse number="15">and he will be one of the great ones in the sight of God. He will drink no wine or strong drink, but he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even while still in his mother’s womb.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And he will persuade many in Israel to convert and turn back to the Lord their God.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He will go before the Lord as a forerunner, with the same power and anointing as Elijah the prophet. He will be instrumental in turning the hearts of the fathers in tenderness back to their children and the hearts of the disobedient back to the wisdom of their righteous fathers. And he will prepare a united people who are ready for the Lord’s appearing.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Zechariah asked the angel, “How do you expect me to believe this? I’m an old man and my wife is too old to give me a child. What sign can you give me to prove this will happen? ”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then the angel said, “I am Gabriel. I stand beside God himself. He has sent me to announce to you this good news.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But now, since you did not believe my words, you will be stricken silent and unable to speak until the day my words have been fulfilled at their appointed time and a child is born to you. That will be your sign!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Meanwhile, the crowds outside kept expecting him to come out. They were amazed over Zechariah’s delay, wondering what could have happened inside the sanctuary.</verse>
				<verse number="22">When he finally did come out, he tried to talk, but he couldn’t speak a word, and they realized from his gestures that he had seen a vision while in the Holy Place.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He remained mute as he finished his days of priestly ministry in the temple and then went back to his own home.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Soon afterward his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and went into seclusion for the next five months.</verse>
				<verse number="25">With joy she exclaimed, “See how kind it is of God to gaze upon me and take away the disgrace of my barrenness!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">During the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, the angel Gabriel was sent from God’s presence to an unmarried girl named Mary, living in Nazareth, a village in Galilee. She was engaged to a man named Joseph, a true descendant of King David.</verse>
				<verse number="27"></verse>
				<verse number="28">Gabriel appeared to her and said, “Rejoice, beloved young woman, for the Lord is with you and you are anointed with great favor.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Mary was deeply troubled over the words of the angel and bewildered over what this may mean for her.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But the angel reassured her, saying, “Do not yield to your fear, Mary, for the Lord has found delight in you and has chosen to surprise you with a wonderful gift.</verse>
				<verse number="31">You will become pregnant with a baby boy, and you are to name him Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="32">He will be supreme and will be known as the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God will enthrone him as King on the throne of his ancestor David.</verse>
				<verse number="33">He will reign as King of Israel forever, and his reign will have no limit.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Mary said, “But how could this happen? I am still a virgin!”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Gabriel answered, “The Spirit of Holiness will fall upon you and almighty God will spread his shadow of power over you in a cloud of glory! This is why the child born to you will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God.</verse>
				<verse number="36">What’s more, your aged aunt, Elizabeth, has also become pregnant with a son. The ‘barren one’ is now in her sixth month.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Not one promise from God is empty of power. Nothing is impossible with God!”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then Mary responded, saying, “ Yes! I will be a mother for the Lord! As his servant, I accept whatever he has for me. May everything you have told me come to pass.” And the angel left her.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Afterward, Mary arose and hurried off to the hill country of Judea, to the village where Zechariah and Elizabeth lived.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Arriving at their home, Mary entered the house and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
				<verse number="41">At the moment her aunt heard Mary’s voice, the baby within Elizabeth’s womb jumped and kicked. And suddenly, Elizabeth was filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit!</verse>
				<verse number="42">With a loud voice she prophesied with power: “Mary! You are a woman given the highest favor and privilege above all others, for your child is destined to bring God great delight.</verse>
				<verse number="43">How did I deserve such a remarkable honor to have the mother of my Lord come and visit me?</verse>
				<verse number="44">The moment you came in the door and greeted me, my baby danced inside me with joy!</verse>
				<verse number="45">Great favor rests upon you, for you have believed every word spoken to you from the Lord.”</verse>
				<verse number="46">And Mary sang this song: “My soul is ecstatic, overflowing with praises to God!</verse>
				<verse number="47">My spirit bursts with joy over my life-giving God!</verse>
				<verse number="48">For he set his tender gaze upon me, his lowly servant girl. And from here on, everyone will know that I have been favored and blessed.</verse>
				<verse number="49">The Mighty One has worked a mighty miracle for me; holy is his name!</verse>
				<verse number="50">Mercy kisses all who fear him, from one generation to the next.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Mighty power flows from him to scatter all those who walk in pride.</verse>
				<verse number="52">Powerful princes he tears from their thrones and he lifts up the lowly to take their place.</verse>
				<verse number="53">Those who hunger for him will always be filled, but the smug and self-satisfied he will send away empty.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Because he can never forget to show mercy, he has helped his chosen servant, Israel,</verse>
				<verse number="55">keeping his promises to Abraham and to his descendants forever.”</verse>
				<verse number="56">Before going home, Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months.</verse>
				<verse number="57">When Elizabeth’s pregnancy was full term, she gave birth to a son.</verse>
				<verse number="58">All her family, friends, and neighbors heard about it, and they too were overjoyed, for they realized that the Lord had showered his wonderful mercy upon her.</verse>
				<verse number="59">When the baby was eight days old, according to their custom, all the family and friends came together for the circumcision ceremony. Everyone assumed that the parents would name the baby Zechariah, after his father,</verse>
				<verse number="60">but Elizabeth spoke up and said, “No, his name is John!”</verse>
				<verse number="61">“What?” they exclaimed. “No one in your family line has that name!”</verse>
				<verse number="62">So they gestured to the baby’s father to ask what to name the child.</verse>
				<verse number="63">He motioned for a writing tablet, and to the amazement of all, he wrote, “His name is John.”</verse>
				<verse number="64">Instantly Zechariah could speak again. And his first words were praises to the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="65">The fear of God fell on the people of their village, and the news of this astounding event traveled throughout the hill country of Judea. Everyone was in awe over it!</verse>
				<verse number="66">All who heard this news were astonished and wondered, “ Since a miracle brought his birth, what on earth will this child become? Clearly, God’s presence is upon this child in a powerful way!”</verse>
				<verse number="67">Then Zechariah was filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit and he prophesied, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="68">“Praise be to the exalted Lord God of Israel, for he has seen us through eyes of grace, and he comes as our Hero-God to set us free!</verse>
				<verse number="69">He appears to us as a mighty Savior, a trumpet of redemption from the house of David, his servant,</verse>
				<verse number="70">just as he promised long ago by the words of his holy prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="71">They prophesied he would come one day and save us from every one of our enemies and from the power of those who hate us.</verse>
				<verse number="72">Now he has shown us the mercy promised to our ancestors, for he has remembered his holy covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="73">He has rescued us from the power of our enemies, fulfilling the sacred oath he made with our father Abraham. Now we can boldly worship God with holy lives, living in purity as priests in his presence every day!</verse>
				<verse number="74"></verse>
				<verse number="75"></verse>
				<verse number="76">And to you I prophesy, my little son, you will be known as the prophet of the Most High. You will be a forerunner, going before the face of Lord Yahweh, to prepare hearts to embrace his ways.</verse>
				<verse number="77">You will preach to his people the revelation of salvation, the cancellation of all our sins, to bring us back to God.</verse>
				<verse number="78">The splendor-light of heaven’s glorious sunrise is about to break upon us in holy visitation, all because the merciful heart of our God is so very tender.</verse>
				<verse number="79">The word from heaven will come to us with dazzling light to shine upon those who live in darkness, near death’s dark shadow. And he will illuminate the path that leads to the way of peace.”</verse>
				<verse number="80">Afterward, their son grew up and was strengthened by the Holy Spirit and he grew in his love for God. John chose to live in the lonely wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">During those days, the Roman emperor, Caesar Augustus, ordered that the first census be taken throughout his empire. (Quirinius was the governor of Syria at that time.)</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">Everyone had to travel to the hometown of their family to complete the mandatory census.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Joseph and his wife, Mary, left Nazareth, a village in Galilee, and journeyed to their hometown in Judea, to the village of Bethlehem, King David’s ancient home. They were required to register there, since they were both direct descendants of David. Mary was pregnant and nearly ready to give birth.</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6">When they arrived in Bethlehem, Mary went into labor, and there she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped the newborn baby in strips of cloth, and Mary and Joseph laid him in a feeding trough since there was no available space in any upper room in the village.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">That night, in a field near Bethlehem, shepherds were watching over their flocks.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared in radiant splendor before them, lighting up the field with the blazing glory of God, and the shepherds were terrified!</verse>
				<verse number="10">But the angel reassured them, saying, “Don’t be afraid, for I have come to bring you good news, the most joyous news the world has ever heard! And it is for everyone everywhere!</verse>
				<verse number="11">For today in Bethlehem a rescuer was born for you. He is the Lord Yahweh, the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="12">You will recognize him by this miraculous sign: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in the feeding trough!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then all at once in the night sky, a vast number of glorious angels appeared, the very armies of heaven! And they all praised God, singing:</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Glory to God in the highest realms of heaven! For there is peace and a good hope given to the sons of men.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">When the choir of angels disappeared and returned to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go! Let’s hurry and find this Word who is born in Bethlehem and see for ourselves what the Lord has revealed to us.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So they hurried off and found their way to Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in a feeding trough.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Upon seeing this miraculous sign, the shepherds recounted what had just happened.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Everyone who heard the shepherds’ story was astonished by what they were told.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But Mary treasured all these things in her heart and often pondered what they meant.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The shepherds returned to their flock, ecstatic over what had happened. They praised God and glorified him for all they had heard and seen for themselves, just like the angel had said.</verse>
				<verse number="21">On the day of the baby’s circumcision ceremony, eight days after his birth, his parents gave him the name Jesus, the name prophesied by the angel before he was born.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Forty days after the birth of her son, Mary’s time of purification had completed, so she came to the temple with a sacrifice, according to the law of Moses. So Mary and Joseph took baby Jesus to Jerusalem to be dedicated before the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For it is stated in the law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male shall be set apart for God”</verse>
				<verse number="24">and is required to offer a prescribed sacrifice, “either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">As they came to the temple to fulfill this requirement, an elderly man was there waiting—a resident of Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. He was a very good man, a lover of God who kept himself pure, and the Spirit of holiness rested upon him. Simeon believed in the imminent appearing of the one called “The Refreshing of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">For the Holy Spirit had revealed to him that he would not see death before he saw the Messiah, the Anointed One of God.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Keeping his promise, the Holy Spirit led Simeon to be in the temple court at the very moment Jesus’ parents entered to fulfill the requirement of the sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Simeon cradled the baby in his arms and praised God and prophesied:</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Lord and Master, I am your loving servant, and now I can die content, for you have fulfilled your promise to me. With my own eyes I have seen your Word, the Savior you sent into the world.</verse>
				<verse number="30"></verse>
				<verse number="31"></verse>
				<verse number="32">He will be glory for your people Israel, and the Revelation-Light for all people everywhere!”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Mary and Joseph stood there, awestruck over what was being said about their baby. Simeon then blessed them and prophesied over Mary, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="34">“A painful sword will one day pierce your inner being, for your child will be rejected by many in Israel. And the destiny of your child is this: he will be laid down as a miracle sign for the downfall and resurrection of many in Israel. Many will oppose this sign, but it will expose to all the innermost thoughts of their hearts before God.”</verse>
				<verse number="35"></verse>
				<verse number="36">A prophetess named Anna was also in the temple court that day. She was from the tribe of Asher and the daughter of Phanuel. Anna was an aged widow who had been married only seven years before her husband passed away. After he died she chose to worship God in the temple continually. For the past eighty-four years she had been serving God with night-and-day prayer and fasting.</verse>
				<verse number="37"></verse>
				<verse number="38">While Simeon was prophesying over Mary and Joseph and the baby, Anna walked up to them and burst forth with a great chorus of praise to God for the child. From that day forward she told everyone in Jerusalem who was waiting for their redemption that the anticipated Messiah had come!</verse>
				<verse number="39">When Mary and Joseph had completed everything required of them by the Law of the Lord, they took Jesus and returned to their home in Nazareth in Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="40">The child grew more powerful in grace, for he was being filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Every year Jesus’ parents went to worship at Jerusalem during the Passover festival.</verse>
				<verse number="42">When Jesus turned twelve, his parents took him to Jerusalem to observe the Passover, as was their custom.</verse>
				<verse number="43">A full day after they began their journey home, Joseph and Mary realized that Jesus was missing.</verse>
				<verse number="44">They had assumed he was somewhere in their entourage, but he was nowhere to be found. After a frantic search among relatives and friends,</verse>
				<verse number="45">Mary and Joseph returned to Jerusalem to search for him.</verse>
				<verse number="46">After being separated from him for three days, they finally found him in the temple, sitting among the Jewish teachers, listening to them and asking probing questions.</verse>
				<verse number="47">All who heard Jesus speak were awestruck at his intelligent understanding of all that was being discussed and at his wise answers to their questions.</verse>
				<verse number="48">His parents were shocked to find him there, and Mary scolded him, saying, “Son, your father and I have searched for you everywhere! We have been worried sick over not finding you. Why would you do this to us?”</verse>
				<verse number="49">Jesus said to them, “Why would you need to search for me? Didn’t you know that it was necessary for me to be here in my Father’s house, consumed with him?”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Mary and Joseph didn’t fully understand what Jesus meant.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Jesus went back home with them to Nazareth and was obedient to them. His mother treasured Jesus’ words deeply in her heart.</verse>
				<verse number="52">As Jesus grew, so did his wisdom and maturity. The favor of men increased upon his life, for he was greatly loved by God.</verse>

			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">A powerful message from God came to John, Zechariah’s son, when he was living out in the lonely wilderness. This prophetic commission came to John during the fifteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius, son of Caesar. Pontius Pilate was governor over Judea at that time. Antipas, son of Herod, was governor over Galilee, Herod’s brother Philip was over the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was over Abilene. This happened during the days of two high priests, Annas and Caiaphas.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">John went preaching and baptizing throughout the Jordan Valley. He persuaded people to turn away from their sins and turn to God for the freedom of forgiveness,</verse>
				<verse number="4">fulfilling what was written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: “Listen! You will hear a thunderous voice in the lonely wilderness telling you to wake up and get your heart ready for the coming of the Lord Yahweh. Make straight every twisted thing in your lives.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Bring into the light every dark way. Make right every wrong. Remove injustice. Every heart of pride will humbly bow before him. Every deception will be exposed and replaced by the truth to prepare everyone everywhere to see the Life of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">John kept preaching to the many crowds who came out to be baptized, “You are nothing but the offspring of venomous snakes, full of deception! Who warned you to repent before the coming wrath of God?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then turn away from your sins, turn to God, and let your changed life be proof. Don’t think for a moment that it’s enough to simply be the favored descendants of Abraham. That’s not enough to save you. I’m telling you, God could make more sons of Abraham out of stones if he chose to!</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Even now God’s axe of judgment is poised to chop down your barren tree right down to its roots! And every tree that does not produce good fruit will be leveled and thrown into the fire.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">The crowd kept asking him, “What then are we supposed to do?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">John told them, “Give food to the hungry, clothe the poor, and bless the needy.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Even the despised tax collectors came to John to be baptized, and they asked him, “What are we to do to prove our hearts have changed?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Be honest,” he replied. “Don’t demand more taxes than what the law requires.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“And us?” asked some soldiers. “What about us?” John answered them, “Be content with what you earn. Never extort money or terrify others by threats of violence or be guilty of accusing the innocent.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">During those days, everyone was gripped with messianic expectations, believing the Messiah could come at any moment, and many began to wonder if John might be the Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But John made it clear by telling them, “There is one coming who is mightier than I. He is supreme. In fact, I’m not worthy of even being his slave. I can only baptize you in this river, but he will baptize you into the Spirit of holiness and into his raging fire.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He has in his hands a winnowing fork to clean up his threshing floor! He will separate the wheat from the chaff. The wheat he will gather into his barn, but he will burn the chaff in a fire that no one can ever put out!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">John used many similar warnings as he preached the good news and prepared the people.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He even publicly rebuked Antipas, son of Herod, the governor of Galilee, for the many wicked things he had done. He fearlessly reprimanded him for seducing and marrying his sister-in-law, Herodias.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Adding to his many other sins, Herod had John seized and locked up in prison.</verse>
				<verse number="21">One day, Jesus came to be baptized along with all the others. As he was consumed with the spirit of prayer, the heavenly realm ripped open above him and the Holy Spirit descended from heaven in the form of a dove and landed on him. Then God’s audible voice was heard, saying, “My Son, you are my beloved one. Through you I am fulfilled.”</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">From the moment of his baptism, Jesus overflowed with the Holy Spirit. He was taken by the Spirit from the Jordan into the wilderness of Judea to experience for forty days the ordeal of testing by the accuser. He ate no food during this time and ended his forty-day fast very hungry.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">It was then the devil said to him, “If you are really the Son of God, command this stone to turn into a loaf of bread for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus replied, “I will not! For it is written in the Scriptures, ‘Life does not come only from eating bread but from God. Life flows from every revelation from his mouth.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The devil lifted Jesus high into the sky, and in a flash showed him all the kingdoms and regions of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The devil then said to Jesus, “All of this, with all its power, authority, and splendor, is mine to give to whomever I wish. Just do one thing, and you will have it all. Simply bow down to worship me, and it will be yours! You will possess everything!”</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus rebuked him and said, “Satan, get behind me! For it is written in the Scriptures, ‘Only One is worthy of adoration; therefore, worship only the Lord your God and love him supremely.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Next, the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem, set him on the highest point of the temple, and tempted him, saying, “If you really are the Son of God, jump down in front of all the people.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For it is written in the Scriptures, ‘God has given his angels instructions to protect you from harm. For angels’ hands will hold you up and keep you from hurting even one foot on a stone.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11"></verse>
				<verse number="12">Jesus replied, “It is also written in the Scriptures, ‘How dare you provoke the Lord your God!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="13">That silenced the devil’s harassment for the time being. So he retreated until an opportune time.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Jesus, armed with the Holy Spirit’s power, returned to Galilee, and his fame spread throughout the region.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He taught in the synagogues and they glorified him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When he came to Nazareth, where he had grown up, he went into the synagogue, as he always did on the Sabbath. When Jesus came to the front to read the Scriptures, he was handed the scroll of the prophet Isaiah. He unrolled the scroll and found where it is written,</verse>
				<verse number="17"></verse>
				<verse number="18">“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, and he has anointed me to be hope for the poor, healing for the brokenhearted, and new eyes for the blind, and to preach to prisoners, ‘You are set free!’ I have come to share the message of Jubilee, for the time of God’s great acceptance has begun.”</verse>
				<verse number="19"></verse>
				<verse number="20">After he read this he rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. Everyone stared at Jesus, wondering what he was about to say.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then he added, “Today, these Scriptures came true in front of you.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Everyone was impressed by how well Jesus spoke, in awe of the beautiful words of grace that came from his lips. But they said among themselves, “ Who does he think he is? Isn’t he Joseph’s son, who grew up here in Nazareth?”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus said to them, “I suppose you’ll quote me the proverb, ‘Doctor, go and heal yourself before you try to heal others.’ And you’ll say, ‘Work the miracles here in your hometown that we heard you did in Capernaum.’</verse>
				<verse number="24">But let me tell you, no prophet is welcomed or honored in his own hometown.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Isn’t it true that many widows lived in the land of Israel during the days of the prophet Elijah when he locked up the heavens for three and a half years and brought a devastating famine over all the land?</verse>
				<verse number="26">But he wasn’t sent to any of the widows living in that region. Instead, he was sent to a foreign place, to a widow in Zarephath of Sidon.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Or have you not considered that the prophet Elisha healed only Naaman, the Syrian, rather than one of the many Jewish lepers living in the land?”</verse>
				<verse number="28">When everyone present heard Jesus’ words, they erupted with furious rage.</verse>
				<verse number="29">They mobbed Jesus and threw him out of the city, dragging him to the edge of the cliff on the hill on which the city had been built, ready to hurl him off.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But he walked right through the crowd, leaving them all stunned.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Jesus went to Capernaum in Galilee and taught the people on the Sabbath day.</verse>
				<verse number="32">His teaching stunned and dazed them, for he spoke with penetrating words and great authority.</verse>
				<verse number="33">In the congregation, there was a demonized man, who screamed out with a loud voice,</verse>
				<verse number="34">“Go away and leave us alone. We know who you are. You’re Jesus of Nazareth, God’s Holy One. What do you want with us? Have you come to destroy us already?”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Immediately the demon hurled the man down on the floor in front of them. But Jesus rebuked the demon, “Be quiet and come out of him!” And without causing him any harm, the demon came out of him.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Great astonishment swept over the people, and they said among themselves, “What kind of man is this who has such power and authority? With a mere word, he commands demons to come out, and they obey him!”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Reports about Jesus spread like wildfire throughout every community in the surrounding region.</verse>
				<verse number="38">After leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into Simon’s house, where Simon’s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever. The disciples begged Jesus to help her.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Jesus stood over her and rebuked the fever, and she was healed instantly. Then she got up and began to serve them.</verse>
				<verse number="40">At sunset, the people brought all those who were sick to Jesus to be healed. Jesus laid his hands on them one by one, and he healed them all of different illnesses.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Demons also came out of many of them. Knowing that Jesus was the Anointed One, the demons shouted while coming out, “You are the Messiah, the Son of El Shaddai!” But Jesus rebuked them and commanded them to be silent.</verse>
				<verse number="42">At daybreak the next morning, the crowds came and searched everywhere for him, but Jesus had already left to go to a secluded place. When they finally found him, they held him tightly, begging him to stay with them in Capernaum.</verse>
				<verse number="43">But Jesus said, “Don’t you know there are other places I must go and offer the hope of God’s kingdom? This is what I have been sent to do.”</verse>
				<verse number="44">Jesus continued to travel and preach in the synagogues throughout the land.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">On one occasion, Jesus was preaching to a crowd on the shore of Lake Galilee. A vast multitude of people was pushing to get close to Jesus to hear the word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He noticed two fishing boats at the water’s edge, with the fishermen nearby, rinsing their nets.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus climbed into the boat belonging to Simon Peter and said to him, “Let me use your boat. Push it off a short distance away from the shore so I can speak to the crowd.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus sat down and taught the people from the boat. When he had finished, he said to Peter, “Now row out to deep water to cast your nets and you will have a great catch.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Master,” Peter replied, “we’ve just come back from fishing all night and didn’t catch a thing. But if you insist, we’ll go out again and let down our nets because of your word.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">When they pulled up their nets, they were shocked to see a huge catch of fish, and their nets were ready to burst!</verse>
				<verse number="7">They waved to their business partners in the other boat for help. They ended up completely filling both boats with fish until they began to sink!</verse>
				<verse number="8">When Simon Peter saw this astonishing miracle, he knelt at Jesus’ feet and begged him, “Go away from me, Master, for I am a sinful man!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Simon Peter and the other fishermen—including his fishing partners, Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee—were awestruck over the miracle catch of fish. Jesus answered, “Do not yield to your fear, Simon Peter. From now on, you will catch men for salvation!”</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">After pulling their boats to the shore, they left everything behind and followed Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="12">One day, while Jesus was in a certain city, he came upon a man covered with leprous sores. When the man recognized Jesus, he fell on his face at Jesus’ feet and begged to be healed, saying, “If you were willing, you could completely heal me.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Jesus reached out and touched him and said, “Of course I am willing to heal you, and now you will be healed.” Instantly, the leprous sores were healed, and his skin became smooth. Jesus said, “Tell no one what has happened, but go to the temple priests and show them you’ve been healed. And to show that you are purified, make an offering for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded. You will become a living testimony to them!”</verse>
				<verse number="14"></verse>
				<verse number="15">After this miracle, the news about Jesus spread even farther. Massive crowds continually gathered to hear him speak and to be healed from their illnesses.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But Jesus often slipped away from them and went into the wilderness to pray.</verse>
				<verse number="17">One day, many Jewish religious leaders known as Pharisees, along with many religious scholars, came from every village in Galilee, throughout Judea, and even from Jerusalem to hear Jesus teach. And the power of the Lord God surged through him to instantly heal the sick.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Some men came to Jesus, carrying a paraplegic man on a stretcher. They attempted to bring him in past the crowd to set him down in front of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But because there were so many people crowding the door, they had no way to bring him inside. So they crawled onto the roof, dug their way through the roof tiles, and lowered the man, stretcher and all, into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Seeing the demonstration of their faith, Jesus said to the paraplegic man, “My friend, your sins are forgiven!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">The Jewish religious leaders and the religious scholars whispered objections among themselves. “Who does this man think he is to speak such blasphemy? Only God can forgive sins! Does he think he is God? ”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Why do you argue in your hearts over what I do and think that it is blasphemy for me to say his sins are forgiven? Let me ask you, which is easier to prove: when I say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or when I say, ‘Stand up, carry your stretcher, and walk’?” Jesus turned to the paraplegic man and said,</verse>
				<verse number="23"></verse>
				<verse number="24">“To prove to you all that I, the Son of Man, have the lawful authority on earth to forgive sins, I say to you now, stand up! Carry your stretcher and go on home, for you are healed.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">In an instant, the man rose right before their eyes. He stood, picked up his stretcher, and went home, giving God the glory with every step he took.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The people were seized with astonishment and dumbfounded over what they had just witnessed. And they all praised God, remarking over and over, “Incredible! What an unbelievable miracle we’ve seen today!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Afterward, Jesus went out and looked for a man named Matthew. He found him sitting at his tax booth, for he was a tax collector. Jesus said to him, “Be my disciple and follow me.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">That very moment, Matthew got up, left everything behind, and followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Matthew wanted to throw a banquet to honor Jesus. So he invited Jesus to his home for dinner, along with many of Levi’s fellow tax collectors and other guests. But the Jewish religious leaders and experts of the law complained to Jesus’ disciples, “Why would you defile yourselves by eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners? Doesn’t Jesus know it’s wrong to do that? ”</verse>
				<verse number="30"></verse>
				<verse number="31">Jesus overheard their complaining and said, “Who goes to the doctor for a cure? Those who are well or those who are sick?</verse>
				<verse number="32">I have not come to call the ‘righteous,’ but to call those who know they are sinners and bring them to repentance.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Jesus’ critics questioned him. “John the prophet is known for leading his disciples to fast often and pray. As the religious leaders of the land, we do the same. Why do you and your disciples spend most of your time feasting at banquets?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus replied, “Should you make the sons of the bridal chamber fast while celebrating with the Bridegroom?</verse>
				<verse number="35">But when the Bridegroom is taken away from them, then you will see them fasting.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">And he gave them this illustration: “No one rips up a new garment to make patches for an old, worn-out one. If you tear up the new to make a patch for the old, it would not match the old garment.</verse>
				<verse number="37">And who pours new wine into an old wineskin? If someone did, the old wineskin would burst and the new wine would be lost.</verse>
				<verse number="38">New wine must always be poured into new wineskins.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Yet you say, ‘The old ways are better,’ and you refuse to even taste the new wine that I bring.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">One Sabbath day, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of ripe wheat. His disciples plucked some heads of grain, rubbed the husks off with their hands, and ate them.</verse>
				<verse number="2">This infuriated some of the Jewish religious leaders. They said to Jesus, “Why are you allowing your disciples to harvest grain on the Sabbath? Don’t you know it’s not permissible according to the law?”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus replied, “Haven’t you read the Scriptures? Haven’t you read what King David did when he was hungry?</verse>
				<verse number="4">He entered the sanctuary of God, took the bread of God’s presence right off the sacred table, and shared it with his men. It was only lawful for the priests to eat the bread of God’s presence.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You need to know that the Son of Man is no slave to the Sabbath, for I am master over the Sabbath.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">On another Sabbath, Jesus was teaching in the synagogue. In the room with him was a man with a deformed right hand. Everyone watched Jesus closely, especially the Jewish religious leaders and the religious scholars, to see if Jesus would heal on a Sabbath, for they were eager to find a reason to accuse him of breaking the Jewish laws.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus, knowing their every thought, said to the man with the deformed hand, “Come and stand here in the middle of the room.” So he got up and came forward.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus said to all who were there, “Let me ask you a question. Which is better: to heal or to do harm on the Sabbath? I have come to save a life, but you have come to find a life to destroy.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">One by one Jesus looked into the eyes of each person in the room. Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your arm and open your hand!” With everyone watching intently, he stretched out his arm, and his hand was completely healed!</verse>
				<verse number="11">The room erupted with bitter rage, and from that moment on, the religious leaders plotted among themselves about how they might harm Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="12">After leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into the high hills to spend the whole night in prayer to God.</verse>
				<verse number="13">At daybreak, he called together all of his followers and selected twelve from among them, and he appointed them to be his apostles.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Here are their names: Simon, whom he named Peter; Andrew, Peter’s brother; Jacob; John; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; Jacob the son of Alpheus; Simon, known as a fiery political zealot; Judah the son of Jacob; and Judas the locksmith, who later betrayed Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus and his apostles came down from the hillside to a level field, where a large number of his disciples waited, along with a massive crowd: people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the coastal district of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They had all come to listen to the Word so that they could be healed of their diseases and be set free from tormenting demonic powers.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The entire crowd eagerly tried to come near Jesus, to touch him to receive healing, because a tangible, supernatural power emanated from him and healed all who came close to him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Looking intently at his followers, Jesus began his sermon. “How enriched you become when you are a beggar, for you will experience the reality of God’s kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“How filled you become when you are consumed with hunger and desire, for you will be completely satisfied. “How content you become when you weep with complete brokenness, for you will laugh with unrestrained joy.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“How favored you become when you are hated, excommunicated, or slandered, or when your name is spoken of as evil because of your love for me, the Son of Man.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“I promise you that as you experience these things, you will celebrate and dance with overflowing joy, and the heavenly reward of your faith will be abundant, because you are being treated the same way as your forefathers the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“But what sorrows await those of you who are rich in this life only, for you have already received all the comfort you’ll ever get.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“What sorrows await those of you who are content with yourselves, for hunger and emptiness will come to you. “What sorrows await those of you who laugh now, having received all your joy in this life only, for grief and wailing will come to you.</verse>
				<verse number="26">“What sorrows await those of you who are always honored and lauded by others, for that’s how your forefathers treated every false prophet.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">“But I say to you who hear, love your enemies and do something wonderful for them in return for their hatred.</verse>
				<verse number="28">When someone curses you, bless that person in return. When others mistreat and harass you, accept it as your mission to pray for them.</verse>
				<verse number="29">To those who despise you, continue to serve them and minister to them. If someone takes away your coat, give him as a gift your shirt as well.</verse>
				<verse number="30">When someone comes to beg from you, give to that person what you have. When things are wrongly taken from you, do not demand they be given back.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The way you want others to treat you is how you should treat everyone else.</verse>
				<verse number="32">“Are you really showing true love by loving only those who love you? Even those who don’t know God will do that.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Are you really showing compassion when you do good deeds only to those who do good deeds to you? Even those who don’t know God will do that.</verse>
				<verse number="34">“If you lend money only to those you know will repay you, what credit is that to your character? Even those who don’t know God do that.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Rather love your enemies and continue to treat them well. When you lend money, don’t despair if you are never paid back, for it is not lost. You will receive a rich reward and you will be known as true children of the Most High God, having his same nature. Be like your Father who is famous for his kindness to heal even the thankless and cruel.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Overflow with mercy and compassion for others, just as your heavenly Father overflows with mercy and compassion for all.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Jesus said, “Forsake the habit of criticizing and judging others, and you will not be criticized and judged in return. Don’t condemn others and you will not be condemned. Forgive over and over, and you will be forgiven over and over.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Give generously and generous gifts will be given back to you, shaken down to make room for more. Abundant gifts will pour out upon you with such an overflowing measure that it will run over the top! The measurement of your generosity becomes the measurement of your return.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Jesus also quoted these proverbs: “What happens when a blind man pretends to guide another blind man? They both stumble into a ditch!</verse>
				<verse number="40">And how could the apprentice know more than his master, for only after he is fully qualified will he be at that level.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Why do you focus on the flaw in someone else’s life and fail to notice the glaring flaws of your own life?</verse>
				<verse number="42">How could you say to your friend, ‘Here, let me show you where you’re wrong,’ when you are guilty of even more than he? You are overly critical, splitting hairs and being a hypocrite! You must acknowledge your own blind spots and deal with them before you will be able to deal with the blind spot of your friend.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">“You’ll never find choice fruit hanging on a bad, unhealthy tree. And rotten fruit doesn’t hang on a good, healthy tree.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Every tree will be revealed by the quality of fruit that it produces. You will never pick figs or grapes from thorn trees.</verse>
				<verse number="45">People are known in this same way. Out of the virtue stored in their hearts, good and upright people will produce good fruit. Likewise, out of the evil hidden in their hearts, evil ones will produce what is evil. For the overflow of what has been stored in your heart will be seen by your fruit and will be heard in your words.</verse>
				<verse number="46">“What good does it do for you to say I am your Lord and Master if you don’t put into practice what I teach you?</verse>
				<verse number="47">Let me describe the one who truly follows me and does what I say:</verse>
				<verse number="48">He is like a man who chooses the right place to build a house and then lays a deep and secure foundation. When the storms and floods rage against that house, it continues to stand strong and unshaken through the tempest, for he built it wisely on the right foundation.</verse>
				<verse number="49">But the one who has heard my teaching and does not obey it is like a man who builds a house without laying any foundation at all. When the storms and floods rage against that house, it will immediately collapse and become a total loss. Which of these two builders will you be? ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">After Jesus finished giving revelation to the people on the hillside, he went on to Capernaum.</verse>
				<verse number="2">A Roman military captain there had a beloved servant whom he valued highly, and who was sick to the point of death. When the captain heard that Jesus was in the city, he sent some respected Jewish elders to plead with him to come and heal his dying servant.</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">So they came to Jesus and told him, “The Roman captain is a wonderful man. If anyone deserves a visit from you, it is him. Won’t you please come to his home and heal his servant?</verse>
				<verse number="5">For he loves the Jewish people, and he even built our meeting hall for us.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus started off with them, but on his way there, friends of the captain stopped him and delivered this message: “Master, don’t bother to come to me in person, for I am not good enough for you to enter my home. I’m not worthy enough to even come out to meet one like you. But if you would just speak the word of healing from right where you are, I know that my servant will be healed.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">I am an ordinary man. Yet I understand the power of authority, and I see that authority operating through you. I have soldiers under me who obey everything I command. I also have authorities over me whom I likewise obey. So Master, just speak the word and healing will flow.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus marveled at this. He turned around and said to the crowd who had followed him, “Listen, everyone! Never have I found among the people of God a man like this who believes so strongly in me.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus then spoke the healing word from a distance. When the man’s friends returned to the home, they found the servant completely healed and doing fine.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Shortly afterward, Jesus left on a journey to the village of Nain, with a massive crowd of people following him, and his disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As he approached the village, he met a multitude of people in a funeral procession, who were mourning as they carried the body of a young man to the cemetery. The boy was his mother’s only son, and she was a widow.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When the Lord saw the grieving mother, his heart broke for her. With great tenderness he said to her, “Please don’t cry.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then he stepped up to the coffin and touched it. When the pallbearers came to a halt, Jesus spoke directly to the corpse, “Young man, I say to you, arise and live!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Immediately, the young man moved, sat up, and spoke to those nearby. Jesus presented the son to his mother, alive!</verse>
				<verse number="16">A tremendous sense of holy mystery swept over the crowd. They shouted praises to God, saying, “God himself has blessed us by visiting his people! A great prophet has appeared among us!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">The news of Jesus and this miracle raced throughout Judea and the entire surrounding region.</verse>
				<verse number="18">John’s disciples reported to him in prison about all the wonderful miracles and the works Jesus was doing.</verse>
				<verse number="19">So John dispatched two of his disciples to go and inquire of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When they came before the Master, they asked him, “Are you the coming Messiah we’ve been expecting, or are we to continue to look for someone else? John the prophet has sent us to you to seek your answer.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Without answering, Jesus turned to the crowd and healed many of their incurable diseases. His miracle power freed many from their suffering. He restored the gift of sight to the blind, and he drove out demonic spirits from those who were tormented.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Only then did Jesus answer the question posed by John’s disciples. “Now go back and tell John what you have just seen and heard here today. The blind are now seeing. The crippled are now walking. Those who were lepers are now cured. Those who were deaf are now hearing. Those who were dead are now brought back to life. The poor and broken are given the hope of salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And tell John these words: ‘The blessing of heaven comes upon those who never lose their faith in me, no matter what happens.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="24">After John’s messengers departed, Jesus spoke about John to the audience crowded around him, saying, “What kind of man did you expect to see out in the wilderness? Did you expect to see a man who would be easily influenced and shaken by the shifting opinions of others?</verse>
				<verse number="25">Who did you go there to see? Did you expect to see a man decked out in the splendid fashion of the day living in the lap of luxury?</verse>
				<verse number="26">Or did you discover a true prophet out in the lonely wilderness? Yes, John was a legitimate prophet. Even more than that,</verse>
				<verse number="27">he was the fulfillment of this Scripture: ‘See, I am sending my prophetic messenger who will go ahead of me to prepare hearts to receive me.’</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Throughout history there was never found a man as great as John. Yet those who now walk in God’s kingdom realm, though they appear to be insignificant, will become even greater than he.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">When the common and disreputable people among the audience heard Jesus say this, they acknowledged that it was the truth, for they had already experienced John’s baptism.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But the hearts of the Jewish religious leaders and experts of the law had rejected the clear purpose of God by refusing to be baptized by John.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Jesus continued, saying, “How could I describe the people of this generation? Can’t you see?</verse>
				<verse number="32">You’re like children playing games on the playground, complaining to friends, ‘You don’t like it when we want to play Wedding. And you don’t like it when we want to play Funeral. Why will you neither dance nor mourn?’</verse>
				<verse number="33">“When the prophet John came fasting and refused to drink wine, you said, ‘He’s crazy! There’s a demon in him.’</verse>
				<verse number="34">Yet when the Son of Man came feasting and drinking, you said, ‘Look at this man! He is nothing but a glutton and a drunkard. He spends all his time with tax collectors and other notorious sinners.’</verse>
				<verse number="35">“Nevertheless, the wisdom of God will be proven true by the expressions of godliness in everyone who follows me.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Afterward Simeon, a Jewish religious leader, asked Jesus to his home for dinner. Jesus accepted the invitation. When he went to Simeon’s home, he took his place at the table.</verse>
				<verse number="37">In the neighborhood there was an immoral woman of the streets, known to all to be a prostitute. When she heard that Jesus was at Simeon’s house, she took an exquisite flask made from alabaster, filled it with the most expensive perfume, went right into the home of the Jewish religious leader, and in front of all the guests, she knelt at the feet of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Broken and weeping, she covered his feet with the tears that fell from her face. She kept crying and drying his feet with her long hair. Over and over she kissed Jesus’ feet. Then, as an act of worship, she opened her flask and anointed his feet with her costly perfume.</verse>
				<verse number="39">When Simeon saw what was happening, he thought, “This man can’t be a true prophet. If he were really a prophet, he would know what kind of sinful woman is touching him.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Jesus said, “Simeon, I have a word for you.” “Go ahead, Teacher. I want to hear it,” he answered.</verse>
				<verse number="41">“It’s a story about two men who were deeply in debt. One owed the bank one hundred thousand dollars, and the other only owed ten thousand dollars.</verse>
				<verse number="42">When it was obvious that neither of them would be able to repay their debts, the kind banker graciously wrote off the debts and forgave them all that they owed. Tell me, Simeon, which of the two debtors would be more thankful? Which one would love the banker most?”</verse>
				<verse number="43">Simeon answered, “I suppose it would be the one with the greater debt forgiven.” “You’re right,” Jesus agreed.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Then he spoke to Simeon about the woman still weeping at his feet. “Do you see this woman kneeling here? She is doing for me what you didn’t bother to do. When I entered your home as your guest, you didn’t think about offering me water to wash the dust off my feet. Yet she came into your home and washed my feet with her many tears and then dried my feet with her hair.</verse>
				<verse number="45">You didn’t even welcome me into your home with the customary kiss of greeting, but from the moment I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet.</verse>
				<verse number="46">You didn’t take the time to anoint my head with fragrant oil, but she anointed my head and feet with the finest perfume.</verse>
				<verse number="47">She has been forgiven of all her many sins. This is why she has shown me such extravagant love. But those who assume they have very little to be forgiven will love me very little.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">Then Jesus said to the woman at his feet, “ All your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">All the dinner guests said among themselves, “Who is the one who can even forgive sins?”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Then Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith in me has given you life. Now you may leave and walk in the ways of peace.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Soon afterward, Jesus began a ministry tour throughout the country, visiting cities and villages to announce the wonderful news of God’s kingdom. His twelve disciples traveled with him</verse>
				<verse number="2">as did a number of women who had been healed of many illnesses and set free from demonic power. One of the women was Mary who was from the village of Magdala, from whom Jesus had cast out seven demons. Among the women were Susanna and</verse>
				<verse number="3">Joanna, the wife of Chusa, who managed King Herod’s household. Many other women who supported Jesus’ ministry from their own personal finances also traveled with him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Massive crowds gathered from many towns to hear Jesus, and he taught them using metaphors and parables, such as this:</verse>
				<verse number="5">“A farmer went out to sow seeds for a harvest. As he scattered his seeds, some of them fell on the hard pathway and were quickly trampled down and unable to grow and became nothing but bird seed.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Some fell on the gravel, and though they sprouted they couldn’t take root; it withered for lack of moisture.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Other seeds fell where there was nothing but weeds. They too were unable to grow to full maturity, for the weeds choked them out.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yet some of the seeds fell into good, fertile soil, and they grew and flourished until they produced more than a hundredfold harvest, a bumper crop.” Then Jesus added, shouting out to all who would hear, “Listen with your heart and you will understand!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Later his disciples came to him privately to ask him what deeper meaning they could find in this parable.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He said, “You have been given a teachable heart to perceive the secret, hidden mysteries of God’s kingdom realm. But to those without a listening heart, my words are merely stories. Even though they have eyes, they are blind to the true meaning of what I say, and even though they listen, they won’t receive full revelation.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Here, then, is the deeper meaning to my parable: The word of God is the seed that is sown into hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The hard pathway represents the hard hearts of those who hear the word of God but the slanderer quickly snatches away what was sown in their hearts to keep them from believing and experiencing salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The seeds falling on gravel represents those who initially respond to the word with joy, but soon afterward, when a season of difficulty and harassment of the enemy comes to them, they wither and fall away, for they have no root in the truth and their faith is temporary.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The seeds that fall into the weeds represents the hearts of those who hear the word of God but their growth is quickly choked off by their own anxious cares, the riches of this world, and the fleeting pleasures of this life. This is why they never become mature and fruitful.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The seed that fell into good, fertile soil represents those lovers of truth who hear it deep within their hearts. They respond by clinging to the word, keeping it dear as they endure all things in faith. This is the seed that will one day bear much fruit in their lives.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">“No one lights a lamp and then hides it, covering it over or putting it where no one sees its light. No, he places the lamp on a lampstand so others benefit from its brightness.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Because this revelation lamp now shines within you, nothing will be hidden from you—it will all be revealed. Every secret of the kingdom will be unveiled and out in the open, made known by the revelation-light.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So pay careful attention to your hearts as you listen to my teaching, for to those who have open hearts, even more revelation will be given to them until it overflows. And for those who do not listen with open hearts, what little light they imagine themselves to have will be taken away.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus’ mother and his brothers came to where Jesus was teaching, but they couldn’t get through the crowd that had gathered around him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Someone told Jesus, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak with you.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus told the crowd, “These who come to listen to me are like my mother and my brothers. They’re the ones who long to hear God’s words and put them into practice.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">One day Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s get in a boat and go across to the other side of the lake.” So they set sail, and soon Jesus fell asleep. But a fierce wind arose and became a violent squall that threatened to swamp their boat.</verse>
				<verse number="23"></verse>
				<verse number="24">Alarmed, the disciples woke Jesus up and said, “Master, Master, we’re sinking! Don’t you care that we’re going to drown?” With great authority Jesus rebuked the howling wind and surging waves, and instantly they became calm.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then Jesus said to them, “Why are you fearful? Have you lost your faith in me?” Shocked, they said with amazement to one another, “Who is this man who has authority over winds and waves that they obey him?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">As soon as they stepped ashore on the eastern side of the lake in the land of the Gerasenes, the disciples were confronted by a demon-possessed madman from a nearby town. Many times he had been put under guard and bound with chains, but the many demons inside him had repeatedly thrown him into convulsions, breaking his shackles and driving him out of the town into the countryside. He had been demonized for a long time and was living naked in a cemetery among the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet and screamed out, “What are you doing here? You are Jesus, the Son of the Most High God!” Jesus commanded the demons to come out of him, and they shouted, “We beg you, don’t torture us!”</verse>
				<verse number="27"></verse>
				<verse number="28"></verse>
				<verse number="29"></verse>
				<verse number="30">Jesus asked the man, “What is your name?” “Mob,” the demons answered. “We are a mob, for there are many of us here in this man.</verse>
				<verse number="31">We beg you, don’t banish us into the Abyss!”</verse>
				<verse number="32">On the hillside nearby, there was a large herd of pigs, and the demons pleaded with Jesus, “Let us enter into the pigs.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">So Jesus ordered all the “mob” of demons to come out of the man and enter the pigs. The crazed herd of swine stampeded over the cliff into the lake and all of them drowned.</verse>
				<verse number="34">When the herders tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off in fear and reported it to the nearby town and throughout the countryside.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then the people of the region came out to see for themselves what had happened. When they came to where Jesus was, they discovered the notorious madman totally set free. He was clothed, speaking intelligently, and sitting at the feet of Jesus. They were shocked!</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then eyewitnesses to the miracle reported all that they had seen and how Jesus completely delivered the demonized man from his torment. After hearing about such amazing power, the townspeople became frightened.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Soon all the people of the region of the Gerasenes and the surrounding country pleaded with Jesus to leave them, for they were gripped with fear. So Jesus got into the boat, intending to return to Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="38">But the man who had been set free begged Jesus over and over not to leave, saying, “Let me be with you!” Jesus sent him away with these instructions:</verse>
				<verse number="39">“Return to your home and your family, and tell them all the wonderful things God has done for you.” So the man went back and preached to everyone who would listen about the amazing miracle Jesus had worked in his life.</verse>
				<verse number="40">When Jesus returned to Galilee, the crowds were overjoyed, for they had been waiting for him to arrive.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Just then, a man named Jairus, the leader of the local Jewish congregation, fell before Jesus’ feet. He desperately begged him to come and heal his twelve-year-old daughter, his only child, because she was at the point of death. As Jesus started to go with him to his home to see her, a large crowd surrounded him.</verse>
				<verse number="42"></verse>
				<verse number="43">In the crowd that day was a woman who had suffered greatly for twelve years from slow bleeding. Even though she had spent all that she had on healers, she was still suffering.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Pressing in through the crowd, she came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe of his garment. Instantly her bleeding stopped and she was healed.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Jesus suddenly stopped and said to his disciples, “Someone touched me. Who was it?” While they all denied it, Peter pointed out, “Master, everyone is touching you, trying to get close to you. The crowds are so thick we can’t walk through all these people without being jostled.”</verse>
				<verse number="46">Jesus replied, “Yes, but I felt power surge through me. Someone touched me to be healed, and they received their healing.”</verse>
				<verse number="47">When the woman realized she couldn’t hide any longer, she came and fell trembling at Jesus’ feet. Before the entire crowd she declared, “I was desperate to touch you, Jesus, for I knew if I could just touch even the fringe of your garment I would be healed.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">Jesus responded, “Beloved daughter, your faith in me released your healing. You may go with my peace.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">While Jesus was still speaking to the woman, someone came from Jairus’ house and told him, “There’s no need to bother the Master any further. Your daughter has passed away. She’s gone.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">When Jesus heard this, he turned to Jairus and said, “Don’t yield to your fear. Have faith in me and she will live again.”</verse>
				<verse number="51">When they arrived at the house, Jesus allowed only Peter, John, and Jacob—along with the child’s parents—to go inside.</verse>
				<verse number="52">Jesus told those left outside, who were sobbing and wailing with grief, “Stop crying. She is not dead; she’s just asleep and must be awakened.”</verse>
				<verse number="53">They laughed at him, knowing for certain that she had died.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Jesus approached the body, took the girl by her hand, and called out with a loud voice, “My sleeping child, awake! Rise up!”</verse>
				<verse number="55">Instantly her spirit returned to her body and she stood up. Jesus directed her stunned parents to give her something to eat and ordered them to tell no one what just happened.</verse>
				<verse number="56"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Jesus summoned together his twelve apostles and imparted to them authority over every demon and the power to heal every disease.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then he commissioned them to proclaim God’s kingdom and to heal the sick to demonstrate that the kingdom had arrived. As he sent them out, he gave them these instructions:</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Take nothing extra on your journey. Just go as you are. Don’t carry a staff, a backpack, food, money, not even a change of clothes.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Whatever home welcomes you as a guest, remain there and make it your base of ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And wherever your ministry is rejected, you are to leave that town and shake the dust off your shoes as a testimony before them.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">The apostles departed and went into the villages with the wonderful news of God’s kingdom, and they healed diseases wherever they went.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now, Herod, the governor, was confused and perplexed when he heard reports of all the miracles of Jesus and his apostles. Many were saying, “John the Baptizer has come back to life!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Others said, “This has to be Elijah who has reappeared or one of the prophets of old who has risen from the dead.” These were the rumors circulating throughout the land. Herod exclaimed,</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Who is this Man? I keep hearing about him over and over. It can’t be the prophet John; I had him beheaded!” So, Herod was very eager to meet Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Months later, the apostles returned from their ministry tour and told Jesus all the wonders and miracles they had witnessed. Jesus, wanting to be alone with the Twelve, quietly slipped away with them toward Bethsaida.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Crowds soon found out about it and took off after him. When they caught up with Jesus, he graciously welcomed them all, taught them more about God’s kingdom, and healed all who were sick.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As the day wore on, the Twelve came to Jesus and told him, “It’s getting late. You should send the crowds to the surrounding villages and farms to get something to eat and find shelter for the night. There’s nothing to eat here in the middle of nowhere.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Jesus responded, “You have the food to feed them.” They replied, “All we have are these five small loaves of bread and two dried fish. Do you really expect us to go buy food for all these people?</verse>
				<verse number="14">There are nearly five thousand men here, with women and children besides!” He told his disciples, “Have them all sit down in groups of fifty each.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">After everyone was seated, Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, and gazing into the heavenly realm he gave thanks for the food. Then, in the presence of his disciples, he broke off pieces of bread and fish, and kept giving more to each disciple to give to the crowd. It was multiplying before their eyes!</verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">So everyone ate until they were filled, and afterward the disciples gathered up the leftovers—it came to exactly twelve baskets full!</verse>
				<verse number="18">One time, Jesus was praying in a quiet place with his disciples nearby. He went to them and asked, “Who do people think I am?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">They answered, “Some are convinced you’re the prophet John who has returned. Others say you are Elijah, or perhaps one of the Jewish prophets brought back from the dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Jesus asked them, “But who do you believe that I am?” Peter said, “You are the Anointed One, God’s Messiah!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell this to anyone yet, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="22">“The Son of Man is destined to experience great suffering and face complete rejection by the Jewish leaders and religious hierarchy. He will be killed and raised back to life on the third day.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus said to all of his followers, “If you truly desire to be my disciple, you must disown your life completely, embrace my ‘cross’ as your own, and surrender to my ways.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For if you choose self-sacrifice, giving up your lives for my glory, you will discover true life. But if you choose to keep your lives for yourselves, you will lose what you try to keep.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Even if you gained all the wealth and power of this world, and all the things it could offer you, yet lost your soul in the process, what good is that?</verse>
				<verse number="26">So why then are you ashamed of being my disciple? Are you ashamed of the revelation-truth I give to you? “I, the Son of Man, will one day return in my radiant brightness, with the holy angels and in the splendor and majesty of my Father. On that day I will be ashamed of everyone who has been ashamed of me.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“I promise you this: there are some of you standing here right now who will not die until you have witnessed the presence and the power of God’s kingdom realm.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Eight days later, Jesus took Peter, Jacob, and John and climbed a high mountain to pray.</verse>
				<verse number="29">As he prayed, his face began to glow until a blinding glory streamed from him. A radiant glory illuminated his entire body. His brightness became so intense that it made his clothing blinding white, as multiple flashes of lightning.</verse>
				<verse number="30">All at once, two men appeared in glorious splendor: Moses and Elijah. They spoke with Jesus about his soon departure from this world and the things the Father destined him to accomplish in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="31"></verse>
				<verse number="32">Peter and his companions had become very drowsy, but they became fully awake when they saw the glory and splendor of Jesus standing there and the two men with him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">As Moses and Elijah were about to return to heaven, Peter impetuously blurted, “Master, this is amazing to see the three of you together! Why don’t we stay here and set up three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">While Peter was still speaking, a radiant cloud of glory formed above them and overshadowed them. As the glory cloud enveloped them, they were struck with fear.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then the voice of God thundered from within the cloud, “This is my Son, my Beloved One. Listen carefully to all he has to say.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">When the thunderous voice faded away and the cloud disappeared, Jesus was standing there alone. Peter, Jacob, and John were awestruck. But they didn’t say a word to anyone about what they had seen.</verse>
				<verse number="37">The next day, a massive crowd was waiting at the foot of the mountain to meet them.</verse>
				<verse number="38">A man in the crowd shouted desperately, “Please, Teacher, I beg of you, do something about my son, my only son.</verse>
				<verse number="39">An evil spirit possesses him and makes him scream out in torment, and hardly ever leaves him alone. It throws him into convulsions and he foams at the mouth. When it finally does leave him, he’s left with horrible bruises.</verse>
				<verse number="40">I begged your disciples to drive it out of him, but they didn’t have enough power to do it.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Jesus responded, “You are an unbelieving people with no faith! You twist your lives with lies that have turned you away from doing the right things. How much longer should I remain here, offering you hope?” Then he said to the man, “Bring your son to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">As the boy approached, the demon slammed him to the ground and threw him into violent convulsions. Jesus sternly commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it left immediately. Jesus healed the boy of his injuries and returned him to his father, saying, “Here is your son.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">Everyone was awestruck and stunned to see such power and the majesty of God flow through Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Everyone marveled, trying to process what they had just witnessed. Jesus then turned to his disciples and said, “Listen carefully and let these words sink into your hearts. The Son of Man is about to be betrayed and surrendered to the authority of men.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">But the disciples could not grasp the meaning of what he was saying, for it was a veiled mystery to them, and they were too embarrassed to ask him to explain it.</verse>
				<verse number="46">The disciples began to argue and became preoccupied over who would be the greatest one among them.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Fully aware of their innermost thoughts, Jesus called a little child to his side and said to them,</verse>
				<verse number="48">“If you tenderly care for this little child on my behalf, you are tenderly caring for me. And if you care for me, you are honoring my Father who sent me. The one who is least important in your eyes is actually the most important one of all.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">The disciple John said, “Master, we found someone casting out demons using your name and we tried to stop him, because he doesn’t follow you as we do.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Jesus responded, “You shouldn’t have hindered him, for anyone who is not against you is your friend.”</verse>
				<verse number="51">Jesus let nothing distract him from departing for Jerusalem because the time for him to be lifted up drew near, and he was full of passion to complete his mission there.</verse>
				<verse number="52">So he sent messengers ahead of him as envoys to a village of the Samaritans.</verse>
				<verse number="53">But as they approached the village, the people turned them away. They would not allow Jesus to enter, for he was on his way to worship in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="54">When the disciples Jacob and John realized what was happening, they returned to Jesus and said, “Lord, if you wanted to, you could command fire to fall down from heaven, just as Elijah did and destroy all these wicked people.”</verse>
				<verse number="55">Jesus rebuked them sharply, saying, “Don’t you realize what spews from your hearts when you say that? The Son of Man did not come to destroy life, but to bring life to the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="56">So they went to another village instead.</verse>
				<verse number="57">On their way, someone came up to Jesus and said, “I want to follow you wherever you go.”</verse>
				<verse number="58">Jesus replied, “Yes, but remember this: even animals in the field have holes in the ground to sleep in, and birds have their nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay down his head.”</verse>
				<verse number="59">Jesus then turned to another and said, “Come be my disciple.” He replied, “Someday I will, Lord, but allow me first to fulfill my duty as a good son and wait until my father passes away.”</verse>
				<verse number="60">Jesus told him, “Don’t wait for your father’s burial. Let those who are already dead wait for death. As for you, go and proclaim everywhere that God’s kingdom has arrived.”</verse>
				<verse number="61">Still another said to him, “Lord, I want to follow you too. But first let me go home and say good-bye to my entire family.”</verse>
				<verse number="62">Jesus responded, “Why do you keep looking back to your past and have second thoughts about following me? If you turn back you are not fit for God’s kingdom.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">After this, the Lord Jesus formed thirty-five teams among the other disciples. Each team was two disciples, seventy in all, and he commissioned them to go ahead of him into every town he was about to visit.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He released them with these instructions: “The harvest is huge. But there are not enough harvesters to bring it in. As you go, plead with the Owner of the Harvest to send out many more workers into his harvest fields.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now, off you go! I am sending you out even though you feel as vulnerable as lambs going into a pack of wolves.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You won’t need to take anything with you—trust in God alone. And don’t get distracted from my purpose by anyone you might meet along the way.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Once you enter a house, speak to the people there and say, ‘God’s blessing of peace be upon this house!’</verse>
				<verse number="6">If a lover of peace resides there, your peace will rest upon that household. But if you are rejected, your blessing of peace will come back upon you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Don’t shift from one house to another, but stay in one home during your time in that city. Eat and drink whatever they serve you. Receive their hospitality, for you are my harvester, and you deserve to be cared for.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“When you enter into a new town, and you have been welcomed by its people, follow these rules: Eat what is served you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Heal the sick, and tell them all, ‘God’s kingdom has arrived and is now within your reach!’</verse>
				<verse number="10">But when you enter a city and they do not receive you, say to them publicly,</verse>
				<verse number="11">‘We wipe from our feet the very dust of your streets as a testimony before you! Understand this: God’s kingdom came within your reach and yet you have rejected God’s invitation!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Jesus continued, “Let me say it clearly: on the day of judgment the wicked people of Sodom will have a lesser degree of judgment than the city that rejects you, for Sodom did not have the opportunity that was given to them.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“How disastrous it will be for the city of Korazin! How horrible for the city of Bethsaida! For if the powerful miracles that I performed in Korazin and Bethsaida had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have humbled themselves, repented, and turned from their sins.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Tyre and Sidon will face a lesser degree of judgment than you will on the day of judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And Capernaum! Do you really think you’ll be highly exalted because of the great things I have done there? No! You’ll be brought down to the depths of hell because of your rejection of me!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Jesus concluded his instructions to the seventy with these words: “Remember this: Whoever listens to your message is actually listening to me. And anyone who rejects you is rejecting me, and not only me but the one who sent me.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">When the seventy missionaries returned to Jesus, they were ecstatic with joy, telling him, “Lord, even the demons obeyed us when we commanded them in your name!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Jesus replied, “ While you were ministering, I watched Satan topple until he fell suddenly from heaven like lightning to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now you understand that I have imparted to you my authority to trample over his kingdom. You will trample upon every demon before you and overcome every power Satan possesses. Absolutely nothing will harm you as you walk in this authority.</verse>
				<verse number="20">However, your real source of joy isn’t merely that these spirits submit to your authority, but that your names are written in the journals of heaven and that you belong to God’s kingdom. This is the true source of your authority.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then Jesus, overflowing with the Holy Spirit’s joy, exclaimed, “Father, thank you, for you are Lord Supreme over heaven and earth! You have hidden the great revelation of this authority from those who are proud, those wise in their own eyes, and you have shared it with these who humbled themselves. Yes, Father. This is what pleases your heart: to give these things to those who are like trusting children.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Father, you have entrusted me with all that you have. No one fully knows the Son except the Father. And no one fully knows the Father except the Son. But the Son is able to reveal the Father to anyone he chooses.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">When Jesus was alone with the Twelve, he said to them, “You are privileged to see and hear all these things.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Many kings and prophets of old longed to see these days of miracles that you’ve been favored to see. They would have given everything to hear the revelation you’ve been favored to hear. Yet they didn’t get to see a glimpse or hear even a whisper.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Just then a religious scholar stood before Jesus in order to test his doctrines. He posed this question: “Teacher, what requirement must I fulfill if I want to live forever in heaven?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Jesus replied, “What do you read in the Law? How do you understand it?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">The religious scholar answered, “It states, ‘You must love the Lord God with all your heart, all your passion, all your energy, and your every thought. And you must love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Jesus said, “That is correct. Now go and do exactly that and you will live.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Wanting to justify himself, he questioned Jesus further, saying, “What do you mean by ‘my neighbor’?”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Jesus replied, “There was once a Jewish man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho when bandits robbed him along the way. They beat him severely, stripped him naked, and left him half dead.</verse>
				<verse number="31">“Soon, a Jewish priest walking down the same road came upon the wounded man. Seeing him from a distance, the priest crossed to the other side of the road and walked right past him, not turning to help him one bit.</verse>
				<verse number="32">“Later, a religious man, a Levite, came walking down the same road and likewise crossed to the other side to pass by the wounded man without stopping to help him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“Finally, another man, a Samaritan, came upon the bleeding man and was moved with tender compassion for him.</verse>
				<verse number="34">He stooped down and gave him first aid, pouring olive oil on his wounds, disinfecting them with wine, and bandaging them to stop the bleeding. Lifting him up, he placed him on his own donkey and brought him to an inn. Then he took him from his donkey and carried him to a room for the night.</verse>
				<verse number="35">The next morning he took his own money from his wallet and gave it to the innkeeper with these words: ‘Take care of him until I come back from my journey. If it costs more than this, I will repay you when I return.’</verse>
				<verse number="36">So, now, tell me, which one of the three men who saw the wounded man proved to be the true neighbor?”</verse>
				<verse number="37">The religious scholar responded, “The one who demonstrated kindness and mercy.” Jesus said, “Go and do the same as he.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">As Jesus and the disciples continued on their journey, they came to a village where a woman welcomed Jesus into her home. Her name was Martha and she had a sister named Mary. Mary sat down attentively before the Master, absorbing every revelation he shared.</verse>
				<verse number="39"></verse>
				<verse number="40">But Martha became exasperated with finishing the numerous household chores in preparation for her guests, so she interrupted Jesus and said, “Lord, don’t you think it’s unfair that my sister left me to do all the work by myself? You should tell her to get up and help me.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">The Lord answered her, “Martha, my beloved Martha. Why are you upset and troubled, pulled away by all these many distractions?</verse>
				<verse number="42">Mary has discovered the one thing most important by choosing to sit at my feet. She is undistracted, and I won’t take this privilege from her.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">One day, as Jesus was in prayer, one of his disciples came over to him as he finished and said, “Would you teach us a model prayer that we can pray, just as John did for his disciples?”</verse>
				<verse number="2">So Jesus taught them this prayer: “Our heavenly Father, may the glory of your name be the center on which our life turns. May your Holy Spirit come upon us and cleanse us. Manifest your kingdom on earth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And give us our needed bread for the coming day.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Forgive our sins as we ourselves release forgiveness to those who have wronged us. And rescue us every time we face tribulations.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Jesus gave this illustration: “Imagine what would happen if you were to go to one of your friends in the middle of the night, pound on his door, and shout, ‘Please! Do you have some food you can spare?</verse>
				<verse number="6">A friend just arrived at my house unexpectedly and I have nothing to serve him.’</verse>
				<verse number="7">But your friend says, ‘Why are you bothering me? The door is locked and my family and I are all in bed. Do you expect me to get up and give you our food?’</verse>
				<verse number="8">I tell you—because of your shameless persistence, even though it’s the middle of the night, your friend will get up out of his bed and give you all that you need.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So it is with your prayers. Ask and you’ll receive. Seek and you’ll discover. Knock on heaven’s door, and it will one day open for you. Every persistent person will receive what he asks for. Every persistent seeker will discover what he needs. And everyone who knocks persistently will one day find an open door.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">“Let me ask you this: Do you know of any father who would give his son a snake on a plate when he asked for a serving of fish? Of course not!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Do you know of any father who would give his daughter a spider when she had asked for an egg? Of course not!</verse>
				<verse number="13">If imperfect parents know how to lovingly take care of their children and give them what they need, how much more will the perfect heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit’s fullness when his children ask him.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">One day a crowd gathered around Jesus, and among them was a man who was mute. Jesus drove out of the man the spirit that made him unable to speak. When the demon left him, the mute man’s tongue was loosed and immediately he was able to speak. The stunned crowd saw it all and marveled in amazement over this miracle!</verse>
				<verse number="15">But there were some in the crowd who protested, saying, “He casts out demons by the power of Satan, the demon king.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Others were skeptical and tried to persuade Jesus to perform a spectacular display of power to prove that he was the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus, well aware of their every thought, said to them, “Every kingdom that is split against itself is doomed to fail and will eventually collapse.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If it is true that Satan casts out his own demons through me, how could his kingdom remain intact?</verse>
				<verse number="19">If Satan gives me the power to cast out his demons, who is it that gives your exorcists their power? Let them become your judges! Go, ask them, and they will tell you.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But if I am casting out demons by God’s mighty power, God’s kingdom is now released upon you— but you still reject it!</verse>
				<verse number="21">“When a strong man, with many weapons, guards his palace, his possessions are safe.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But when one stronger than he comes to attack and overpower him, the stronger one will empty the arsenal in which he trusted. The conqueror will ransack his kingdom and distribute all the spoils of victory.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Whoever is not on my side is against me, and whoever does not gather the spoils with me will be forever scattered.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“When a demon is cast out of a person, it goes to wander in a waterless realm, searching for rest. But finding no place to rest, it says, ‘I will go back and reoccupy the body I left.’</verse>
				<verse number="25">When it returns, it finds the person like a house swept clean and made tidy, but empty.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then it goes and enlists seven demons more evil than itself, and they all enter and possess the person, leaving that one in a much worse state than before.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">While he was saying all this, a woman shouted from the crowd, “God bless the one who gave you birth and nursed you as a child!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Yes,” said Jesus, “but God will bless all who listen to the word of God and carefully obey everything they hear.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">As the crowds continued to swell, Jesus went on to say, “How evil is this generation! When you demand a mighty display of power simply to prove who I am, you demonstrate your unbelief. The only sign you will see will be a repeat of the miracle of Jonah.</verse>
				<verse number="30">In the same way Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.</verse>
				<verse number="31">“The Queen of Sheba will rise up on the day of judgment to accuse and condemn this generation for its unbelief. She journeyed from a far and distant land just to listen to the wisdom of King Solomon. One greater than Solomon speaks with you today, but you refuse to listen.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Yes, the people of Nineveh will also rise up on the day of judgment to accuse and condemn this generation. For they all repented when they heard the preaching of Jonah, but you refuse to repent. Yet there is one greater than Jonah who is preaching to you today.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">“No one would think of lighting a lamp and then hiding it in the basement where no one would benefit. A lamp belongs on a lampstand, where all who enter may see its light.</verse>
				<verse number="34">The eyes of your spirit allow revelation-light to enter into your being. When your heart is open the light floods in. But when your heart is hard and closed, the light cannot penetrate and darkness takes its place.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Open your heart and consider my words. Watch out that you do not mistake your opinions for revelation-light!</verse>
				<verse number="36">If your spirit burns with light, fully illuminated with no trace of darkness, you will be a shining lamp, reflecting rays of truth by the way you live.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">After Jesus finished saying these things, a Pharisee asked him to come for a meal at his home. When everyone had been seated at the table, the religious leader noticed that Jesus had not performed the cleansing ritual before he began eating. He was shocked.</verse>
				<verse number="38"></verse>
				<verse number="39">The Lord said, “You Pharisees are like those who will wipe clean only the outside of a cup or bowl, leaving the inside filthy.</verse>
				<verse number="40">You are foolish to ignore the greed and wickedness within you! Shouldn’t the one who cleans the outside also clean the inside?</verse>
				<verse number="41">If you free your heart of greed, show compassion and true generosity to the poor, you will have more than clean hands; you will be clean within.</verse>
				<verse number="42">“You Pharisees are hypocrites! For you are obsessed with peripheral issues, like paying meticulous tithes on the smallest herbs that grow in your gardens. Of course, these matters you should do, but when you unjustly cheat others, you ignore the most important duty of all: to walk in the love of God. Readjust your values and place first things first.</verse>
				<verse number="43">“You Pharisees are hypocrites! You love to be honored before others with titles of respect, seeking public recognition, aspiring to seem more important than others.</verse>
				<verse number="44">“You Pharisees, what hypocrites! Your true character is hidden, like an unmarked grave that hides the corruption inside, defiling all who come in contact with you.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">Just then a specialist in interpreting religious law blurted out, “Teacher, don’t you realize that your words insult us?!”</verse>
				<verse number="46">Jesus responded, “You are also hypocrites, you experts of the law! You crush people beneath the burden of obeying impossible religious regulations, yet you would never even think of doing them yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="47">What hypocrites! You build monuments to honor the prophets of old, yet it was your murdering ancestors who killed them. The only prophet you’ll honor is a dead one!</verse>
				<verse number="48">In fact, by erecting monuments to the prophets your ancestors killed, you demonstrate your agreement with those murderers and bear witness to their deeds. You’re no better than they!</verse>
				<verse number="49">That is why God’s wisdom is proclaiming: ‘I will send to them apostles and prophets though some they will murder and others they will persecute.’</verse>
				<verse number="50">“God will hold this generation accountable for every drop of blood of every murdered prophet shed from the beginning of time until now,</verse>
				<verse number="51">from the blood of Abel, who was killed by his brother, to the blood of Zechariah, who was murdered in the middle of the temple court. Yes, I tell you, you will be responsible for it all.</verse>
				<verse number="52">“You are nothing but hypocrites, you experts of religion! You take away from others the key that opens the door to the house of knowledge. Not only do you lock the door and refuse to enter, but you also do your best to keep others from the truth.”</verse>
				<verse number="53">All that Jesus said enraged the religious leaders and experts of the law and they began to oppose him furiously. They harassed Jesus all the way out the door, spewing out their hostility, arguing over everything he said—wanting nothing more than to find a reason to entrap him with his own words.</verse>
				<verse number="54"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">By now a crowd of many thousands had gathered around Jesus. So many people pushed to be near him, they began to trample one another. Jesus turned to his disciples and warned them, “Beware of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. It permeates everything they do and teach, like leaven.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Everything hidden and covered up will soon be exposed. For the facade is falling down, and nothing will be kept secret for long.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Whatever you have spoken in private will be public knowledge, and what you have whispered secretly behind closed doors will be broadcast far and wide for all to hear.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Listen, my beloved friends, don’t fear those who may want to take your life but can do nothing more. It’s true that they may kill your body, but they have no power over your soul.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The one you must fear is God, for he has both the power to take your life and the authority to cast your soul into hell. Yes, the only one you need to fear is God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“What is the value of your soul to God? Could your worth be defined by any amount of money? God doesn’t abandon or forget even the small sparrow he has made. How then could he forget or abandon you? What about the seemingly minor issues of your life? Do they matter to God? Of course they do! So you never need to worry, for you are more valuable to God than anything else in this world.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">“I can assure you of this: If you freely declare in public that I am the Son of Man, the Messiah, then I will freely declare to all the angels of God that you are mine.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But if you publicly pretend that you don’t know me, I will deny you before the angels of God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">If anyone speaks evil of me, the Son of Man, that one can be forgiven. But if anyone speaks scornfully against the Holy Spirit, it will never be forgiven.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And remember this: When people publicly accuse you and forcefully drag you before the religious leaders and authorities, do not be troubled. Don’t worry about defending yourself or how to answer their accusations.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Simply be confident and allow the Spirit of Wisdom access to your heart, and in that very moment he will reveal what you are to say to them.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Just then someone spoke up from the crowd and said, “Master, you should compel my older brother to divide the family inheritance and give me my fair share!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Jesus answered, “My friend, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Speaking to the people, Jesus continued, “Be alert and guard your heart from greed and from always wishing for what you don’t have. For your life can never be measured by the amount of things you possess.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Jesus then gave them this illustration: “A wealthy land owner had a farm that produced bumper crops. Every year the harvest was so great it filled his barns to overflowing!</verse>
				<verse number="17">He thought, ‘What should I do now that every barn is full and I have nowhere else to store more?</verse>
				<verse number="18">I know what I’ll do! I’ll tear down the barns and build one massive barn to hold all my grain and goods.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then I can just sit back, surrounded with comfort and ease. I’ll enjoy life with no worries at all.’</verse>
				<verse number="20">“God said to him, ‘What a fool you are to trust in your riches and not in me! This very night the messengers of death will demand to take your life. Then who will get all the wealth you have stored up for yourself?’</verse>
				<verse number="21">The same thing will happen to all those who fill up their lives with everything but God.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Jesus taught his disciples, saying, “Listen to me. Never let anxiety enter your hearts. Never worry about any of your needs, such as food or clothing.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For your life is infinitely more than just the food you eat or the clothing you wear.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Take the carefree birds as your example. Do you ever see them worry? They neither grow their own food nor put it in a storehouse for later. Yet God takes care of every one of them, feeding each of them out of the abundance of his love and goodness. Isn’t your life more precious to God than a bird? Be carefree in the care of God!</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Does worry add anything to your life? Can it add one more year, or even one day?</verse>
				<verse number="26">So if worrying adds nothing, but actually subtracts from your life, why would you worry about God’s care of you?</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Think about the lilies. They grow and become beautiful, not because they work hard or strive to clothe themselves. Yet not even Solomon, wearing his kingly garments of splendor, could be compared to a field of lilies.</verse>
				<verse number="28">If God can clothe the fields and meadows with grass and flowers, can he not clothe you as well, O struggling one with so many doubts?</verse>
				<verse number="29">I repeat: Don’t let worry enter your life. Live above the anxious cares about your personal needs.</verse>
				<verse number="30">People everywhere seem to worry about making a living, but your heavenly Father knows your every need and will take care of you.</verse>
				<verse number="31">As you passionately seek his kingdom, above all else, he will supply your needs.</verse>
				<verse number="32">So don’t ever be afraid, dearest friends! Your loving Father joyously gives you his kingdom with all its promises!</verse>
				<verse number="33">“Now, go and sell what you have and give to those in need; you will be making deposits in your account in heaven, an account that will never be taken from you. Your gifts will become a secure and unfailing treasure, deposited in heaven forever.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Where you deposit your treasure, that is where you fix your thoughts—and your heart will long to be there also.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">“Be prepared for action at a moment’s notice.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Be like servants anticipating their master’s return from a wedding celebration. They are ready at a moment’s notice to unlock and open the door for him.</verse>
				<verse number="37">What great joy is ahead for those who stay awake and wait for their Master’s return! He himself will become their servant and wait on them.</verse>
				<verse number="38">He may appear at midnight or even later, but what great joy for the awakened ones whenever he comes!</verse>
				<verse number="39">Of course, if they knew ahead of time the hour of their master’s appearing, they would be alert, just as they would be ready if they knew ahead of time that a thief was coming to break into their house.</verse>
				<verse number="40">So keep being alert and ready at all times. For I promise you that the Son of Man will surprise you and appear when you don’t expect him.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">“Lord,” Peter asked, “does this apply only to the twelve of us, or is it for everyone else as well?”</verse>
				<verse number="42">The Lord replied, “A master will delegate authority in his house to a trustworthy and thoughtful manager who understands his master’s desires. And the household manager will serve others what they need at exactly the right time.</verse>
				<verse number="43">And whenever his master returns, he will find that his servant has served him well. I promise you, the master will reward him generously and he will be placed as an overseer of everything he owns.</verse>
				<verse number="44"></verse>
				<verse number="45">“But what if that servant says in his heart, ‘My master delays his coming, and who knows when he will return?’ Because of the delay, the servant elevates himself and mistreats those in his master’s household. Instead of caring for the ones he was appointed to serve, he abuses the other servants, both men and women. He throws drunken parties for his friends and gives himself over to every pleasure.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Let me tell you what will happen to him. His master will suddenly return at a time that shocks him, and he will remove the abusive, selfish servant from his position of trust. The master will punish him and assign him a portion with the unbelievers.</verse>
				<verse number="47">“Every servant who knows what pleases his master yet does not make himself ready and refuses to put his master’s will to action will receive many punishing blows.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Every servant who does not know his master’s will and unwittingly does what is wrong will receive a less severe punishment. For those who have received a greater revelation from their master are required a greater obedience. And those who have been entrusted with great responsibility will be held more responsible to their master.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">“I have come to set the earth on fire, and how I wish it were already ablaze with fiery passion for God!</verse>
				<verse number="50">But first I must be immersed into the baptism of God’s judgment, and I am consumed with passion as I await its fulfillment.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Don’t think for a moment that I came to grant peace and harmony to everyone. No, my arrival will change everything and create hostility among you.</verse>
				<verse number="52">From now on, even family members will be divided over me and will choose sides one against another.</verse>
				<verse number="53">Fathers will be divided from sons and sons from fathers; mothers will be divided from daughters and daughters from mothers; mothers-in-law will be against brides and brides against mothers-in-law—all because of me.”</verse>
				<verse number="54">Jesus then said to the crowds gathered around him, “When you see a cloud forming in the west, don’t you say, ‘A storm is brewing’? And then it arrives.</verse>
				<verse number="55">And when you feel the south wind blowing, you say, ‘A heat wave is on the way.’ And so it happens.</verse>
				<verse number="56">What hypocrites! You are such experts at forecasting the weather, but you are totally unwilling to understand the spiritual significance of the time you’re living in.</verse>
				<verse number="57">“You can’t even judge for yourselves what is good and right.</verse>
				<verse number="58">“When you are guilty of wrong-doing, it is better to agree with your adversary and settle your dispute before you have to go before a judge. If not, your adversary may drag you into court, and the judge may find you guilty and</verse>
				<verse number="59">throw you into prison until you have paid off your fine entirely.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Some of those in the crowd informed Jesus that Pilate had slaughtered some Galilean Jews while they were offering sacrifices at the temple, mixing their blood with the sacrifices they were offering.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Jesus turned and asked them, “Do you believe that the slaughtered Galileans were the worst sinners of all the Galileans?</verse>
				<verse number="3">No, they weren’t! So listen to me, unless you all repent, you will perish as they did.</verse>
				<verse number="4">What about the eighteen who perished when the tower of Siloam fell upon them? Do you really think that they were more guilty than all of the others in Jerusalem?</verse>
				<verse number="5">No, they weren’t, and unless you repent, you too will all eternally perish, just as they did.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then Jesus told them this parable: “There was a man who planted a fig tree in his orchard. But every time he came to gather fruit from his tree he found none, for it was barren.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So he said to his gardener, ‘For the last three years I’ve come to gather figs from my tree but it remains fruitless. What a waste! Go ahead and cut it down!’</verse>
				<verse number="8">“But the gardener protested, ‘Sir, we should leave it one more year. Let me fertilize and cultivate it, then let’s see if it will produce fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="9">If it doesn’t bear figs by next year, we’ll cut it down.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="10">One Sabbath day, while Jesus was teaching in the synagogue,</verse>
				<verse number="11">he encountered a seriously handicapped woman. She was crippled and had been doubled over for eighteen years. Her condition was caused by a demonic spirit of bondage that had left her unable to stand up straight.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When Jesus saw her condition, he called her to him and gently laid his hands on her. Then he said, “Dear woman, you are free. I release you forever from this crippling spirit.” Instantly she stood straight and tall and overflowed with glorious praise to God!</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">The Jewish leader who was in charge of the synagogue was infuriated over Jesus healing on the Sabbath day. “Six days you are to work,” he shouted angrily to the crowd. “On those days you should come here for healing, but not on the seventh day!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">The Lord replied, “You hypocrites! Don’t you care for your animals on the Sabbath, untying your ox or donkey from the stall and leading it away to water?</verse>
				<verse number="16">If you do this for your animals, what’s wrong with allowing this beloved daughter of Abraham, who has been bound by Satan for eighteen long years, to be untied and set free on a Sabbath day?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">When they heard this, his critics were completely humiliated. But the crowds shouted with joy over the glorious things Jesus was doing among them.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Jesus taught them this parable: “How can I describe God’s kingdom?</verse>
				<verse number="19">God’s kingdom is like the smallest seed that one might plant in a garden. When it grows, it becomes a huge tree, with so many spreading branches that various birds make nests there.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Jesus taught them another parable: “How can I describe God’s kingdom?</verse>
				<verse number="21">God’s kingdom is like something as small as yeast that a woman kneads into a large amount of dough. It works unseen until it permeates the entire batch and the loaf rises high.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Jesus ministered from village to village, making his way to Jerusalem and teaching the people as he went.</verse>
				<verse number="23">A bystander asked him, “Lord, will only a few have eternal life?” Jesus said to the crowd,</verse>
				<verse number="24">“There is a great cost for anyone to enter through the narrow doorway into God’s kingdom. I tell you, many will want to enter but won’t be able to.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Once the head of the house has shut and locked the door, it will be too late. Even if you stand outside knocking, begging to enter, and saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open the door for us,’ he will say to you, ‘I don’t know who you are. You are not a part of my family.’</verse>
				<verse number="26">“Then you will reply, ‘But Lord, we dined with you and walked with you as you taught us.’</verse>
				<verse number="27">And he will reply, ‘Don’t you understand? I don’t know who you are, for you are not a part of my family. I will not let you in. Now, go away from me! For you are all disloyal to me and do evil.’</verse>
				<verse number="28">“You will experience great weeping and great anguish when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with all the prophets of Israel, enjoying God’s kingdom while you yourselves are barred from entering.</verse>
				<verse number="29">You will see people streaming from the four corners of the earth, accepting the invitation to feast in God’s kingdom realm, while you are outside looking in.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And take note of this: Some are despised and viewed as the least important now, but one day the master will place them at the head of the line. And some whom you view as ‘elite’ today will become the least important then.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Just then some Jewish religious leaders came to Jesus to urge him to flee from that place because Herod was out to kill him.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Jesus told them, “Go and tell that deceiver that I will continue to cast out demons and heal the sick today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will bring my work to perfection.</verse>
				<verse number="33">For everyone knows I am safe until I come to Jerusalem, for that is where all the prophets have been killed.</verse>
				<verse number="34">O City of Jerusalem, you are the city who murders your prophets! You are the city who pelts to death with stones the very messengers sent to deliver you! So many times I have longed to gather your wayward children together around me, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings—but you were too stubborn to let me.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Now it is too late, since your house will be left in ruins. You will not see me again until you are able to say, ‘We welcome the one who comes to us sent in the name of the Lord.’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">One Sabbath, Jesus was on his way to dine with a prominent Jewish religious leader for a festive meal. Everyone was watching him to see if he would heal anyone on the Sabbath.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Just then, standing right in front of him was a man with his limbs suffering from edema.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus asked the experts of the law and the Pharisees who were present, “Does the law permit a man to heal on the Sabbath day? Is it right or wrong?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">No one dared answer, so Jesus turned to the sick man, released healing to him, and sent him on his way.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Jesus said to them all, “If one of your children or one of your animals fell into a well, wouldn’t you do all you could to rescue them even on the Sabbath?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">There was nothing they could say—all were silenced.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When Jesus noticed how the guests for the meal were all vying for the seats of honor, he shared this story with the guests around the table:</verse>
				<verse number="8">“When you are invited to an important social function, don’t be quick to sit near the head of the table, choosing for yourself a seat of honor. What will happen to you when someone arrives who is more distinguished than you?</verse>
				<verse number="9">The host will bring him over to where you are sitting and ask for your seat, saying in front of all the guests, ‘You’re in the wrong place. Please give this person your seat.’ Disgraced, you will have to take whatever seat is left.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Instead, when you’re invited to a banquet, you should choose to sit in the lowest place. When your host comes and sees you there, he may say, ‘My friend, come with me and let me seat you in a better place.’ Then, in front of all the other guests at the banquet, he will honor you by seating you in the place of highest respect.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Remember this: everyone with a lofty opinion of who he is and who seeks to raise himself up will be publicly humbled. And everyone with a modest opinion of who he is and chooses to humble himself will be raised up before all.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Jesus turned to his host and said, “When you throw a banquet, don’t just invite your friends, relatives, or rich neighbors—for it is likely they will return the favor.</verse>
				<verse number="13">It is better to invite those who never get an invitation. If you invite the poor to your banquet, along with the outcast, the handicapped, and the blind—those who could never repay you the favor, then you will experience a great blessing in this life, and at the resurrection of the godly you will receive a full reward.”</verse>
				<verse number="14"></verse>
				<verse number="15">When they heard this, one of the dinner guests said to Jesus, “Someday God will have a kingdom feast, and how happy and privileged will be the ones who get to share in that joy!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Jesus replied with this parable: “A man invited many to join him in a great feast.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When the day for the feast arrived, the host instructed his servant to notify all the invited guests and tell them, ‘Come, for everything is now ready for you!’</verse>
				<verse number="18">But one by one they all made excuses. One said, ‘I can’t come. I just bought some property and I have to go and look it over.’</verse>
				<verse number="19">Another said, ‘Please accept my regrets, for I just purchased five teams of oxen and I need to make sure they can pull the plow.’</verse>
				<verse number="20">Another one said, ‘I can’t come because I just got married.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">“The servant reported back to the host and told him of all their excuses. The master became angry and said to his servant, ‘Go at once throughout the city and invite anyone you find—the poor, the blind, the disabled, the hurting, and the lonely. Invite them to my banquet.’</verse>
				<verse number="22">“When the servant returned to his master, he said, ‘Sir, I have done what you asked, but there’s still room for more.’</verse>
				<verse number="23">“So the master told him, ‘All right. Go out again, and this time bring them all back with you. Persuade the beggars on the streets, the outcasts, even the homeless. Insist that they come in and enjoy the feast so that my house will be full.’</verse>
				<verse number="24">“I say to you all, no one who receives an invitation to feast with me and makes excuses will ever enjoy my banquet.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">As massive crowds followed Jesus, he turned to them and said,</verse>
				<verse number="26">“When you follow me as my disciple, you must put aside your father, your mother, your wife, your sisters, your brothers; it will even seem as though you hate your own life. This is the price you’ll pay to be considered one of my followers.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Anyone who comes to me must be willing to share my cross and experience it as his own, or he cannot be considered to be my disciple.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So don’t follow me without considering what it will cost you. For who would construct a house before first sitting down to estimate the cost to complete it?</verse>
				<verse number="29">Otherwise he may lay the foundation and not be able to finish. The neighbors will ridicule him, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="30">‘Look at him! He started to build but couldn’t complete it!’</verse>
				<verse number="31">“Have you ever heard of a commander who goes out to war without first sitting down with strategic planning to determine the strength of his army to win the war against a stronger opponent?</verse>
				<verse number="32">If he knows he doesn’t stand a chance of winning the war, the wise commander will send out delegates to ask for the terms of peace.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Likewise, unless you surrender all to me, giving up all you possess, you cannot be one of my disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="34">“Salt is good for seasoning. But if salt were to lose its flavor, how could it ever be restored?</verse>
				<verse number="35">It will never be useful again, not even fit for the soil or the manure pile! If you have ears opened by the Spirit, then hear the meaning of what I have said and apply it to yourselves.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Many dishonest tax collectors and other notorious sinners often gathered around to listen as Jesus taught the people.</verse>
				<verse number="2">This raised concerns among the Jewish religious leaders and experts of the law. Indignant, they grumbled and complained, saying, “Look at how this man associates with all these notorious sinners and welcomes them all to come to him!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">In response, Jesus gave them this illustration:</verse>
				<verse number="4">“There once was a shepherd with a hundred lambs, but one of his lambs wandered away and was lost. So the shepherd left the ninety-nine lambs out in the open field and searched in the wilderness for that one lost lamb. He didn’t stop until he finally found it. With exuberant joy, he raised it up, placed it on his shoulders, and carried it back with cheerful delight!</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6">Returning home, he called all his friends and neighbors together and said, ‘Let’s have a party! Come and celebrate with me the return of my lost lamb. It wandered away, but I found it and brought it home.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jesus continued, “In the same way, there will be a glorious celebration in heaven over the rescue of one lost sinner who repents, comes back home, and returns to the fold—more so than for all the righteous people who never strayed away.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus gave them another parable: “There once was a woman who had ten valuable silver coins. When she lost one of them, she swept her entire house, diligently searching every nook and cranny for that one lost coin.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When she finally found it, she gathered all her friends and neighbors for a celebration, telling them, ‘Come and celebrate with me! I had lost my precious silver coin, but now I’ve found it.’</verse>
				<verse number="10">That’s the way God responds every time one lost sinner repents and turns to him. He says to all his angels, ‘Let’s have a joyous celebration, for the one who was lost, I have found!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then Jesus said, “Once there was a father with two sons.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The younger son came to his father and said, ‘Father, don’t you think it’s time to give me my share of your estate?’ So the father went ahead and distributed between the two sons their inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Shortly afterward, the younger son packed up all his belongings and traveled off to see the world. He journeyed to a far-off land where he soon wasted all he was given in a binge of extravagant and reckless living.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“With everything spent and nothing left, he grew hungry, because there was a severe famine in that land.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So he begged a farmer in that country to hire him. The farmer hired him and sent him out to feed the pigs.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The son was so famished, he was willing even to eat the slop given to the pigs, because no one would feed him a thing.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Humiliated, the son finally realized what he was doing, and he thought, ‘There are many workers at my father’s house who have all the food they want with plenty to spare. They lack nothing. Why am I here dying of hunger, feeding these pigs and eating their slop?</verse>
				<verse number="18">I want to go back home to my father’s house, and I’ll say to him, “Father, I was wrong. I have sinned against you.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I’ll never again be worthy to be called your son. Please, Father, just treat me like one of your employees.” ’</verse>
				<verse number="20">“So the young son set off for home. From a long distance away, his father saw him coming, dressed as a beggar, and great compassion swelled up in his heart for his son who was returning home. The father raced out to meet him, swept him up in his arms, hugged him dearly, and kissed him over and over with tender love.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Then the son said, ‘Father, I was wrong. I have sinned against you. I could never deserve to be called your son. Just let me be—’ “The father interrupted and said, ‘Son, you’re home now!’</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Turning to his servants, the father said, ‘Quick, bring me the best robe, my very own robe, and I will place it on his shoulders. Bring the ring, the seal of sonship, and I will put it on his finger. And bring out the best shoes you can find for my son.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Let’s prepare a great feast and celebrate.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For my beloved son was once dead, but now he’s alive! Once he was lost, but now he is found!’ And everyone celebrated with overflowing joy.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Now, the older son was out working in the field when his brother returned, and as he approached the house, he heard the music of celebration and dancing.</verse>
				<verse number="26">He called over one of the servants and asked, ‘What’s going on?’</verse>
				<verse number="27">“The servant replied, ‘It’s your younger brother. He’s returned home and your father is throwing a party to celebrate his homecoming.’</verse>
				<verse number="28">“The older son became angry and refused to go in and celebrate. So his father came out and pleaded with him, ‘Come and enjoy the feast with us!’</verse>
				<verse number="29">“The son said, ‘Father, listen! How many years have I worked like a slave for you, performing every duty you’ve asked as a faithful son? And I’ve never once disobeyed you. But you’ve never thrown a party for me because of my faithfulness. Never once have you even given me a goat that I could feast on and celebrate with my friends as this son of yours is doing now.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Look at him! He comes back after wasting your wealth on prostitutes and reckless living, and here you are throwing a great feast to celebrate—for him!’</verse>
				<verse number="31">“The father said, ‘My son, you are always with me by my side. Everything I have is yours to enjoy.</verse>
				<verse number="32">It’s only right to rejoice and celebrate like this, because your brother was once dead and gone, but now he is alive and back with us again. He was lost, but now he is found!’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">Jesus taught his disciples using this story: “Once a very rich man hired a manager to run his business and oversee all his wealth. But soon a rumor spread that the manager was wasting his master’s money.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So the master called him in and said, ‘Is it true that you are mismanaging my estate? You need to provide me with a complete audit of everything you oversee for me. I’ve decided to dismiss you.’</verse>
				<verse number="3">“The manager thought, ‘Now what am I going to do? I’m finished here. I can’t hide what I’ve done, and I’m too proud to beg.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I have an idea that will secure my future. It will win me favor and secure friends who can take care of me and help me when I get fired!’</verse>
				<verse number="5">“So the dishonest manager hatched his scheme. He went to everyone who owed his master money, one by one, and asked them, ‘How much do you owe my master?’</verse>
				<verse number="6">One debtor owed twenty thousand dollars, so he said to him, ‘Let me see your bill. Pay me now and we’ll settle for twenty percent less.’ The clever manager scratched out the original amount owed and reduced it by twenty percent. And to another who owed two hundred thousand dollars, he said, ‘Pay me now and we’ll reduce your bill by fifty percent.’ And the clever manager scratched out the original amount owed and reduced it by half.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">“Even though his master was defrauded, when he found out about the shrewd way this manager had feathered his own nest, he congratulated the clever scoundrel for what he’d done to provide for his future.” Jesus continued, “Remember this: The sons of darkness interact more wisely than the sons of light.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Use the wealth of this world to demonstrate your friendship with God by winning friends and blessing others. Then, when it runs out, your generosity will provide you with an eternal reward.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“The one who faithfully manages the little he has been given will be promoted and trusted with greater responsibilities. But those who cheat with the little they have been given will not be considered trustworthy to receive more.</verse>
				<verse number="11">If you have not handled the riches of this world with integrity, why should you be trusted with the eternal treasures of the spiritual world?</verse>
				<verse number="12">And if you’ve not proven yourself faithful with what belongs to another, why should you be given wealth of your own?</verse>
				<verse number="13">It is impossible for a person to serve two masters at the same time. You will be forced to love one and reject the other. One master will be despised and the other will have your loyal devotion. Your choice between God and the wealth of this world is no different. You must enthusiastically love one and definitively reject the other.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now, the Jewish religious leaders listening to Jesus were lovers of money. They laughed at what he said and mocked his teachings,</verse>
				<verse number="15">so Jesus addressed them directly. “You always want to look spiritual in the eyes of others, but you have forgotten the eyes of God, which see what is inside you. The very things that you approve of and applaud are the things God despises.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The law of Moses and the revelation of the prophets have prepared you for the arrival of the kingdom announced by John. Since that time, the wonderful news of God’s kingdom is being preached, and people’s hearts burn with extreme passion to receive it.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Heaven and earth will disintegrate before even the smallest detail of the Law will fail or lose its power.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“It is wrong for you to divorce your wife so that you can marry another—that is adultery. And when you take that one you lusted after as your wife, and contribute to the breakup of her marriage, you commit adultery again.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus continued. “There once was a very rich man who had the finest things imaginable, living every day enjoying his life of opulent luxury.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Outside the gate of his mansion was a poor beggar named Lazarus. He lay there every day, covered with boils, and all the neighborhood dogs would come and lick his open sores. The only food he had to eat was the garbage that the rich man threw away.</verse>
				<verse number="21"></verse>
				<verse number="22">“One day poor Lazarus died, and the angels of God came and escorted his spirit into paradise.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“The day came that the rich man also died. In hell he looked up from his torment and saw Abraham in the distance, and Lazarus was standing beside him in the glory.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The rich man shouted, ‘Father Abraham! Father Abraham! Have mercy on me. Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and come to cool my tongue, for I am in agony in these flames of fire!’</verse>
				<verse number="25">“But Abraham responded, ‘My friend, don’t you remember? While you were alive, you had all you desired. You surrounded yourself in luxury, while Lazarus had nothing. Now Lazarus dwells in the comforts of paradise and you are in agony.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Besides, between us is a huge chasm that cannot be bridged, nor can anyone cross from one realm to the other, even if he wanted.’</verse>
				<verse number="27">“The rich man continued, ‘Then let me ask you, Father Abraham, please send Lazarus to my relatives.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Tell him to witness to my five brothers and warn them not to end up where I am in this place of torment.’</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Abraham replied, ‘They’ve already had plenty of warning. They have the teachings of Moses and the revelation of the prophets; let them hear them.’</verse>
				<verse number="30">“ ‘What if they’re not listening?’ the rich man added. ‘If someone from the dead were to go and warn them, they would surely repent.’</verse>
				<verse number="31">“Abraham said to him, ‘If they wouldn’t listen to Moses and the prophets, neither would they be convinced if someone were raised from the dead!’ ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">One day Jesus taught his disciples: “Betrayals are inevitable, but great devastation will come to the one guilty of betraying others.</verse>
				<verse number="2">It would be better for him to have a heavy boulder tied around his neck and be hurled into the deepest sea than to face the punishment of betraying one of my dear ones! So be alert to your brother’s condition,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and if you see him going the wrong direction, cry out and correct him. If there is true repentance on his part, forgive him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">No matter how many times in one day your brother sins against you and says, ‘I’m sorry; I am changing; forgive me,’ you need to forgive him each and every time.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Upon hearing this, the apostles said to Jesus, “Lord, you must increase our measure of faith!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus responded, “If you have even the smallest measure of faith, it would be powerful enough to say to this large tree, ‘My faith will pull you up by the roots and throw you into the sea,’ and it will respond to your faith and obey you.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jesus continued, “After a servant has finished his work in the field or with the livestock, he doesn’t immediately sit down to relax and eat. No, a true servant prepares the food for his master and makes sure his master is served his meal before he sits down to eat his own.</verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">Does the servant expect to be thanked for doing what is required of him?</verse>
				<verse number="10">So learn this lesson: After doing all that is commanded of you, simply say, ‘We are mere servants, undeserving of special praise, for we are just doing what is expected of us and fulfilling our duties.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="11">On his way to Jerusalem Jesus passed through the border region between Samaria and Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As he entered one village, ten men approached him, but they kept their distance, for they were lepers.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They shouted to him, “Mighty Lord, our wonderful Master! Won’t you have mercy on us and heal us?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">When Jesus stopped to look at them, he spoke these words: “Go to be examined by the Jewish priests.” They set off, and they were healed while walking along the way.</verse>
				<verse number="15">One of them, a Samaritan, when he discovered that he was completely healed, turned back to find Jesus, shouting out joyous praises and glorifying God.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When he found Jesus, he fell down at his feet and thanked him over and over, saying to him, “You are the Messiah.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“So where are the other nine?” Jesus asked. “Weren’t there ten who were healed?</verse>
				<verse number="18">They all refused to return to give thanks and give glory to God except you, a foreigner from Samaria?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then Jesus said to the healed man lying at his feet, “Arise and go. It was your faith that brought you salvation and made you whole.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Jesus was once asked by the Jewish religious leaders, “When will God’s kingdom come?” Jesus responded, “God’s kingdom does not come simply by obeying principles or waiting for signs.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The kingdom is not discovered in one place or another, for God’s kingdom realm is already expanding within some of you.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Later, Jesus addressed this again with his apostles, saying, “The time is coming when a great passion will be awakened within you to see me again. Yes, you will long to see the beginning of the days of the Son of Man, but you won’t be able to find me.</verse>
				<verse number="23">You will hear reports from some who will say, ‘Look, he has returned,’ ‘He’s over here,’ or, ‘He’s over there!’ Don’t believe it or run after them, for their claims will be false.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The day of the Son of Man will burst forth with the brightness of a lightning strike that shines from one end of the sky to the other, illuminating the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“But before this takes place, the Son of Man must pass through great suffering and rejection from this generation.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The same things that happened in the days of Noah will take place in the days of the Son of Man.</verse>
				<verse number="27">They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, and they were given in marriage until the day Noah boarded the ark and the devastating flood came and swept them all away.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“The days of the Son of Man can also be compared to the days of Lot. The people of that time lived their lives as normal. They got married, raised families, built homes and businesses, yet they were totally unaware of what was coming until the day Lot departed from Sodom. The sky opened up and rained fire and burning sulfur upon them, destroying everyone and everything they had built. So it will be on the day of the unveiling of the Son of Man.</verse>
				<verse number="29"></verse>
				<verse number="30"></verse>
				<verse number="31">“On that day, if one is outside, he won’t even have time to go back into the house to gather his belongings. And those toiling in their fields won’t have time to run back home.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Don’t forget the example of Lot’s wife and what happened to her when she turned back.</verse>
				<verse number="33">All who are obsessed with being secure in life will lose it all—including their lives. But those who let go of their lives and surrender them to me will discover true life.</verse>
				<verse number="34">For in that night there will be two lying in their bed; one will be suddenly swept away while the other will be left alive.</verse>
				<verse number="35">There will be two women working together at household duties; one will be suddenly swept away while the other will be left alive.”</verse>
				<verse number="36"></verse>
				<verse number="37">His apostles asked, “Lord, where will this judgment happen?” Jesus responded, “ It will be obvious, for wherever there are those spiritually dead, there you will find the eagles circling.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">One day Jesus taught the apostles to keep praying and never stop or lose hope. He shared with them this illustration:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“In a certain town there was a judge, a thick-skinned and godless man who had no fear of others’ opinions.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And in the same town there was a poor widow who kept pleading with the judge, ‘Grant me justice and protect me from my oppressor!’</verse>
				<verse number="4">“He ignored her pleas for quite some time, but she kept asking. Eventually he said to himself, ‘This widow keeps annoying me, demanding her rights, and I’m tired of listening to her. Even though I’m not a religious man, and I don’t care about the opinions of others, I’ll get her off my back by answering her claims for justice and I’ll rule in her favor. Then she’ll leave me alone.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus continued, “Did you hear what the godless judge said—that he would answer her persistent request?</verse>
				<verse number="7">Don’t you know that God, the true judge, will grant justice to all his chosen ones who cry out to him night and day? He will pour out his Spirit upon them. He will not delay to answer you and give you what you ask for.</verse>
				<verse number="8">God will give swift justice to those who don’t give up. So be ever praying, ever expecting, in the same way as the widow. Even so, when the Son of Man comes back, will he find this kind of undying faith on earth?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus taught this parable to those who were convinced they were morally upright and to those who trusted in their own virtue yet looked down on others with disgust:</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Two men who went into the temple to pray. One was a proud religious leader, the other a despised tax collector.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The religious leader stood apart from the others and prayed, ‘How I thank you, O God, that I’m not wicked like everyone else. They’re cheaters, swindlers, and crooks—like that tax collector over there. God, you know that I never cheat or commit adultery; I fast from food twice a week and I give you a tenth of all I earn.’</verse>
				<verse number="12"></verse>
				<verse number="13">“The tax collector stood alone in a corner, away from the Holy Place, and covered his face in his hands, feeling that he was unworthy even to look up to God. Beating his breast, he sobbed with brokenness and tears saying, ‘God, please, in your mercy and because of the blood sacrifice, forgive me, for I am nothing but the most miserable of all sinners!’</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Which one of them left for home that day reconciled to God? The humble tax collector, not the religious leader! For everyone who praises himself will one day be publicly humiliated, and everyone who humbles himself will one day be publicly honored and lifted up.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">The people brought their babies and small children to Jesus so that he might lay his hands on them to bless them. When the disciples saw this, they scolded the parents and told them to stop troubling the Master.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Seeing what was happening, Jesus called for the parents, the children, and his disciples to come and listen to him. Then he told them, “Never hinder a child from coming to me but let them all come, for God’s kingdom belongs to them as much as it does to anyone else. These children demonstrate to you what faith is all about.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Learn this well: unless you receive the revelation of the kingdom the same way a little child receives it, you will never be able to enter in.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">One day a wealthy Jewish nobleman of high standing posed this question to Jesus: “Wonderful Teacher, what must I do to receive eternal life?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus answered, “Why would you call me wonderful when there is only one who is wonderful—and that is God alone?</verse>
				<verse number="20">You already know what is right and what the commandments teach: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not lie, and honor your father and your mother.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="21">The wealthy leader replied, “These are the very things I’ve been doing for as long as I can remember.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Ah,” Jesus said, “there’s still one thing you’re missing in your life.” “What is that?” asked the man. “You must go and sell everything you own and give all the proceeds to the poor so you will have eternal treasures. Then come and follow me.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">These words devastated the rich leader, for he was extremely wealthy.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Jesus saw his disappointment, and looking right at him said, “It is next to impossible for those who have everything to enter into God’s kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Nothing could be harder! You could compare it to trying to stuff a rope through the eye of a needle.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Those who heard this said, “Then who can be saved?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Jesus responded, “What appears humanly impossible is more than possible with God. For God can do what man cannot.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Peter said, “Master, see how we’ve left all that we have, our houses and our careers, to follow you.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus replied, “Listen to my words: anyone who leaves his home behind and chooses God’s kingdom over wife, children, parents, and family, it will come back to him many more times in this lifetime. And in the age to come, he will inherit even more than that—he will inherit eternal life!”</verse>
				<verse number="30"></verse>
				<verse number="31">Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them in private, “We are going to Jerusalem so that everything prophesied about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</verse>
				<verse number="32">They will betray him and hand him over to the people, and they will mock him, insult him, and spit in his face.</verse>
				<verse number="33">And after they have abused and flogged the Son of Man, they will kill him. But in three days he will rise again.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">The disciples had no clue what he was saying, for his words were a mystery that was hidden from them.</verse>
				<verse number="35">As Jesus and his followers arrived at Jericho, a blind beggar was sitting by the roadside.</verse>
				<verse number="36">When he heard the crowd approaching, he asked, “What’s all this commotion about?”</verse>
				<verse number="37">“It’s Jesus!” they said. “Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">The blind beggar shouted, “Jesus, Son of David, have pity and show me mercy!”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Those in the front of the crowd scolded him and warned him to be quiet, but the blind beggar screamed out even louder, “Jesus, Son of David, show me mercy!”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Suddenly Jesus stopped and directed those nearby, “Bring the man over to me.” When they brought him before Jesus, he asked the man,</verse>
				<verse number="41">“What do you want me to do for you?” “Master,” he said, “please, I want to see.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">Jesus said, “Now you will see. Receive your sight this moment, for your faith in me has given you sight and new life.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">Instantly he could see again. His eyes popped open, and he saw Jesus standing in front of him! He shouted loud praises to God and he followed Jesus. And when the crowd saw what happened, they too erupted with shouts of praise to God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">On his way to Jerusalem, Jesus had to pass through Jericho.</verse>
				<verse number="2">There lived a very wealthy man named Zacchaeus, who supervised all the tax collectors.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He was very eager to see Jesus and kept trying to get a look at him through the massive crowd. Since Zacchaeus was a short man and couldn’t see over the heads of the people,</verse>
				<verse number="4">he ran on ahead of everyone and climbed up a blossoming fig tree to get a glimpse of Jesus as he passed by.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When Jesus got to that place, he looked up into the tree and said, “Zacchaeus, hurry on down, for I must stay at your house today!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So he scurried down the tree and found himself face-to-face with Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="7">As Jesus left to go with Zacchaeus, many in the crowd complained, “Look at this! Of all the people to have dinner with, he’s going to eat in the house of a crook.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Zacchaeus was amazed over his gracious visit to his home and joyously welcomed Jesus. Zacchaeus stood in front of the Lord and said, “Half of all that I own I will give to the poor. And Lord, if I have cheated anyone, I promise to pay them back four times as much as I stole.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus said to him, “Your repentance shows that today life has come to you and your household, and that you are a true son of Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The Son of Man has come to seek out and to give life to those who are lost.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">At this time Jesus was getting close to entering Jerusalem. The crowds that followed him were convinced that God’s kingdom would fully manifest when Jesus established it in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So he told them this story to change their perspective: “Once a wealthy prince left his province to travel to a distant land, where he would be crowned king and then return.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Before he departed he summoned his ten servants together and charged them, ‘I am entrusting each of you with fifty thousand dollars to invest while I am away. Trade with it and put the money to work until I return.’</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Some of his countrymen despised the prince and sent a delegation after him to declare before the royals, ‘We refuse to let this man rule over us! He will not be our king!’</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Nevertheless, he was crowned king and returned to his land. Then he summoned his ten servants to see how much each one had earned and what their profits came to.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“The first one came forward and said, ‘Master, I took what you gave me and invested it, and it multiplied ten times.’</verse>
				<verse number="17">“ ‘Splendid! You have done well, my excellent servant. Because you have shown that I can trust you in this small matter, I now grant you authority to rule over ten cities.’</verse>
				<verse number="18">“The second came and said, ‘Master, what you left with me has multiplied five times.’</verse>
				<verse number="19">“His master said, ‘I also grant you authority in my kingdom over five cities.’</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Another came before the king and said, ‘Master, here is the money you entrusted to me. I hid it for safekeeping.</verse>
				<verse number="21">You see, I live in fear of you, for everyone knows you are a strict master and impossible to please. You push us for a high return on all that you own, and you always want to gain from someone else’s efforts.’</verse>
				<verse number="22">“The king said, ‘You wicked servant! I will judge you using your own words. If what you said about me is true, that I am a harsh man, pushing you for a high return and wanting gain from others’ efforts,</verse>
				<verse number="23">why didn’t you at least put my money in the bank to earn some interest on it?’</verse>
				<verse number="24">“The king said to his other servants, ‘Take the money he has and give it to the faithful servant who multiplied my money ten times over.’</verse>
				<verse number="25">“ ‘But master,’ the other servants objected, ‘why give it to him? He already has so much!’</verse>
				<verse number="26">“ ‘Yes,’ replied the king. ‘But to all who have been faithful, I will give even more to them. And for the ones who have nothing, even the little they seem to have I will take from them.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Now, bring all those rebellious enemies of mine who rejected me as their king—bring them here before me and execute them!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="28">After saying all of this, Jesus headed straight for Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="29">When he arrived at the stables of Annia near the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples ahead, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="30">“When you enter the next village, you will find tethered there a donkey’s young colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And if anyone stops you and asks, ‘What are you doing?’ just tell them this: ‘It is needed for the Lord.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="32">The two disciples entered the village and found the colt exactly like Jesus had said.</verse>
				<verse number="33">While they were untying it, the owners confronted them and asked, “What are you doing?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">The disciples replied, “We need this donkey for the Lord.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">After they brought the colt to Jesus, they placed their prayer shawls on its back, and Jesus rode it as he descended the Mount of Olives toward Jerusalem. As he rode toward the city, people spontaneously threw their prayer shawls like a carpet on the path in front of him.</verse>
				<verse number="36"></verse>
				<verse number="37">As soon as he got to the bottom of the Mount of Olives, the crowd of his followers shouted with a loud outburst of ecstatic joy over all the mighty wonders of power they had witnessed.</verse>
				<verse number="38">They shouted over and over, “Highest praises to God for the one who comes as King in the name of the Lord! Heaven’s peace and glory from the highest realm now comes to us!”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Some Jewish religious leaders who stood off from the procession said to Jesus, “Teacher, order your followers at once to stop saying these things!”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Jesus responded, “Listen to me. If my followers were silenced, the very stones would break forth with praises!”</verse>
				<verse number="41">When Jesus caught sight of the city, he burst into tears with uncontrollable weeping over Jerusalem,</verse>
				<verse number="42">saying, “If only you could recognize that this day peace is within your reach! But you cannot see it.</verse>
				<verse number="43">For the day is soon coming when your enemies will surround you, hem you in on every side, and lay siege to you.</verse>
				<verse number="44">They will crush you to pieces, and your children too! And they will leave your city totally destroyed. Since you would not recognize God’s day of visitation, you will see your day of devastation!”</verse>
				<verse number="45">Jesus entered the temple area and forcibly threw out all the merchants from their stalls.</verse>
				<verse number="46">He rebuked them, saying, “The Scriptures declare, ‘My Father’s house is to be filled with prayer—a house of prayer, not a cave of bandits!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="47">From then on Jesus continued teaching in the temple area, but the high priests, the experts of the law, and the prominent men of the city kept trying to find a strategy to accuse Jesus, for they wanted him dead.</verse>
				<verse number="48">They could find no reason to accuse him, for he was a hero to the people and the crowds were awestruck by every word he spoke.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">One day Jesus was teaching in the temple courts and sharing with the people the wonderful news of salvation. The high priest, the experts of the law, and the prominent men of the city confronted Jesus and asked him,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“We want to know right now by what authority are you teaching here in the temple? And who gave you the authority to teach these things?”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus responded, “First, let me ask you a question and you tell me right now.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Did John baptize because he had a commission from heaven or merely from men?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">His interrogators pulled themselves aside to consider how to respond to Jesus. “What should we say? If we say that John’s mandate was from heaven, he will ask us, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him and be baptized?’</verse>
				<verse number="6">But if we say, ‘John’s mandate was merely from men,’ then all the people around him will stone us, for they believe John was a prophet of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So unable to devise an answer they said to Jesus, “We cannot tell where John’s authority came from.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus said, “Then neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus taught the people using this story: “A man once planted a vineyard, then leased it out to tenants. Then he left to go abroad and was away for a long time.</verse>
				<verse number="10">At harvest time, the owner sent one of his servants to the tenants to collect the landowner’s share of the harvest, but the tenants sent him away, beaten and empty-handed.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So the owner dispatched another one of his servants to collect his portion, but the tenants treated him the same way. They cursed him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then the owner sent a third servant, but they brutalized him also with the same treatment.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Finally the owner of the vineyard said to his son, ‘Perhaps if I send you, my own cherished son, they will be ashamed of what they’ve done.’</verse>
				<verse number="14">“But when the tenants saw the son coming, they schemed among themselves. ‘This is the heir of the vineyard! If we kill him, the inheritance will be ours.’</verse>
				<verse number="15">So they threw the son off the property and killed him. “I ask you, what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do to his son’s murderers?</verse>
				<verse number="16">He will come back and destroy them and give his vineyard to another.” When the people heard this story, they all agreed, “This should never happen!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus looked straight at the people and their leaders and said, “What do you think this verse means? ‘The worthless, rejected stone has become the cornerstone, the most important stone of all.’</verse>
				<verse number="18">Everyone who falls in humility upon that stone will be broken. But if that stone falls on you, it will grind you to pieces!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">When the high priests and experts of the law realized that this story was about them, they wanted to have Jesus arrested that very moment, but they were afraid of all the people.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Later, they sent spies who pretended to be honest seekers, but who wanted an opportunity to entangle Jesus by his words. Their plan was to catch him saying something against the government, so they could hand him over to the jurisdiction of the Roman authorities who would execute him for sedition.</verse>
				<verse number="21">At the right time they asked him this question: “Teacher, we know that all you say is straightforward and what you teach us is right. You give us the true ways of God. You’re one who shows no favoritism to anyone’s status. So we ask you—</verse>
				<verse number="22">is it proper or not to pay taxes to a corrupt government?”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus saw right through their cunning ploy and said, “Why are you testing me?</verse>
				<verse number="24">Show me one of the Roman coins. Whose head is on the coin? Whose title is stamped on it?” They answered, “Why, it’s Caesar’s.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus said, “Precisely. The coin bears the image of the Emperor Caesar, and you should give back to Caesar all that belongs to him. But you bear the image of God. So give back to God all that belongs to him.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">The imposters were left speechless and amazed in the presence of all the people, unable to trap Jesus with his words.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Some of the Sadducees (a religious group that denies there is a resurrection of the dead) came to ask Jesus this question:</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Teacher, the law of Moses teaches that if a man dies before he has children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother’s family line.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Now suppose there was a family with seven brothers, and the oldest married and died without children.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then his brother married the widow, and he too died with no children. And it continued to happen, one brother after another brother, until each of the seven had married the widow and died childless.</verse>
				<verse number="31"></verse>
				<verse number="32">Then finally, the widow died too. So here’s our dilemma:</verse>
				<verse number="33">Whose wife will the woman be when she’s resurrected from the dead? Which of the brothers will be her husband, since all seven were once married to her?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus replied, “Marriage is meant for this world only.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Those who are worthy of the resurrection from the dead into glory become immortal, like the angels, who never die nor marry. When the dead come to life again, they will be children of God—the children of the resurrection.</verse>
				<verse number="36"></verse>
				<verse number="37">Even Moses taught the resurrection of the dead when he wrote of the Lord God who was at the burning bush and said ‘I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’</verse>
				<verse number="38">Don’t you agree that God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living? For in his eyes, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are alive forevermore. He is the God who raises the dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">The experts of the law chimed in, “Yes, Teacher, you speak the truth beautifully.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">From then on, the religious Sadducees never dared ask Jesus a question again.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Jesus then posed this question to the people: “How can the experts of the law say that Messiah is David’s son?</verse>
				<verse number="42">Haven’t you read in the Psalms where David himself wrote: The Lord Yahweh said to my Lord, ‘Sit near me in the place of authority</verse>
				<verse number="43">until I subdue all your enemies under Your feet!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="44">Jesus explained, “If David calls this one ‘my Lord,’ how can he be his son?”</verse>
				<verse number="45">Within earshot of all the people, Jesus warned his disciples,</verse>
				<verse number="46">“Don’t follow the example of these pretentious experts of the law! They love to parade around in their religious garments so that people honor them wherever they go. They like to sit right up front in every meeting and push their way to the head table at every banquet.</verse>
				<verse number="47">And for an offering they will pray long religious prayers at the homes of widows, cheating them out of their very livelihood. Beware of them all, because one day the Judge will strip them of honor, and judge them severely.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">Jesus observed all the wealthy coming into the temple courts wanting to be noticed as they came with their offerings.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He noticed a very poor widow who dropped two small copper coins in the offering box.</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Listen to me,” he said. “This poor widow has given a larger offering than any of the wealthy.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For the rich only gave out of their surplus, but she sacrificed out of her poverty and gave to God all that she had to live on.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Some of the disciples remarked about the beauty of the temple. They pointed out all the lovely adornments and how it was built with excellence from the gifts given to God. Jesus said,</verse>
				<verse number="6">“The day of utter destruction will come to everything you admire here. It will all become a heap of rubble!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Master, tell us,” they asked, “when exactly will this happen? Can you tell us what warning sign to look for when it is about to take place?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus responded, “Deception will run rampant and many will appear on the scene, saying I have sent them, or saying about themselves, ‘I am the Messiah!’ These doomsday deceivers will say, ‘The end of the age is now here!’ But listen to me. Don’t let any of these imposters fool you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“There will also be many wars and revolutions on every side, with rumors of more wars to come. Don’t panic or give in to your fears, for these things are bound to happen. This is still not the end yet.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus continued, “ There will be upheavals of every kind. Nations will go to war against each other, and kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="11">There will be terrible earthquakes and seismic events of epic proportion that result in famines in one place after another. There will be horrible plagues and epidemics, cataclysmic storms on the earth, and astonishing signs and cosmic disturbances in the heavens. But before all of this happens, you will be hunted down and arrested, persecuted by both civil and religious authorities, and thrown into prison.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And because you follow me, you will be on trial before kings and governmental leaders as an opportunity to testify to them in my name.</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">Yet determine in your hearts not to prepare for your own defense. Simply speak with the words of wisdom that I will give you that moment, and none of your persecutors will be able to withstand the grace and wisdom that comes from your mouths.</verse>
				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16">“You can expect betrayal even by your parents, your brothers, your relatives and friends—and yes, some of you will die as martyrs.</verse>
				<verse number="17">You will be hated by all because of my life in you.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But don’t worry. My grace will never desert you or depart from your life.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Stand firm with patient endurance and you will find your souls’ deliverance.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">“When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know for sure that its devastation is imminent.</verse>
				<verse number="21">At that time all who are living in Judea must flee to the mountains. Those who live inside the city gates, leave and flee, and those who live outside the city must not enter it seeking refuge.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For these will be the days of God’s vengeance to fulfill what has been written against Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="23">It will be extremely difficult for pregnant women and for those nursing little ones in that day, for great persecution and wrath will rise against this nation.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Many will be cut down by the sword or scattered as prisoners to many countries. And Jerusalem shall be trampled down by nations until the days of world empires come to an end.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Expect to witness amazing and perplexing signs with the sun, the moon, and the stars. The raging of the sea will bring desperation and turmoil to many nations.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Earthquakes will bring panic and disaster. What men see coming to the earth will cause the fear of doom to grip their hearts, for they will even see the powers of the heavenly realm shaken!</verse>
				<verse number="27">“And at last, when you see how the Son of Man comes—surrounded with a cloud, with great power and miracles, in the radiance of his splendor, and with great glory and praises —it will make you jump for joy! For the time of your full transformation has arrived.”</verse>
				<verse number="28"></verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus gave his disciples this parable: “Haven’t you observed that when the fig tree, or any tree, buds and blooms, the season is changing and summer is near?</verse>
				<verse number="30"></verse>
				<verse number="31">In the same way, when you see these prophetic signs occurring, you realize the earth is yielding to the fullness of God’s kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="32">I assure you, the end of this age will not come until all I have spoken has come to pass.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Earth and sky will wear out and fade away before one word I speak loses its power or fails to accomplish its purpose.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">“Be careful that you never allow your hearts to grow cold. Be careful that you are not caught off guard, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and the worries of this life, and that day will come upon you suddenly like a trap. Don’t let me come and find you drunk or living carelessly like everyone else.</verse>
				<verse number="35">For that day will come as a shocking surprise to all.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Keep a constant watch over your soul, and pray for the courage and grace to prevail over these things that are destined to occur and that you will stand before the presence of the Son of Man with a clear conscience.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Each day, Jesus taught in the temple and spent his nights on the Mount of Olives.</verse>
				<verse number="38">And all the people came early to the temple courts to listen to the words he taught.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">As the celebration of the Passover Lamb was approaching, the Jewish religious leaders and scholars of the law continually schemed to find a way to murder Jesus without starting a riot—for they feared the crowds.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">At that time Satan himself entered into Judas the locksmith, who was one of the twelve apostles.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He secretly went to the religious hierarchy and the captains of the temple guards to discuss with them how he could betray Jesus and turn him over to their hands.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The religious hierarchy was elated over Judas’ treachery, and they agreed to give him a sum of money in exchange for Jesus’ betrayal.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Judas vowed that he would find them a suitable opportunity to betray Jesus when he was away from the crowds.</verse>
				<verse number="7">On the day the Passover lambs were to be sacrificed, Jesus sent for Peter and John and instructed them, “Go and prepare the Passover supper so we can eat it together.”</verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">They asked him, “Where do we make the preparations to eat the meal?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus gave them this sign: “When you enter the city, you will find a man carrying a jug of water. Follow him home</verse>
				<verse number="11">and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher told us to ask you, “Where is the room I may use to have the Passover meal with my disciples?” ’</verse>
				<verse number="12">He will then take you to a large, fully furnished upstairs room. Make the preparations for us there.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">They went and found everything to be exactly like Jesus had prophesied, and they prepared the Passover meal.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When Jesus arrived at the upper room, he took his place at the table along with all the apostles.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then he told them, “I have longed with passion and desire to eat this Passover lamb with you before I endure my sufferings.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I promise you that the next time we eat this, we will be together in the feast of God’s kingdom.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then he raised a cup and gave thanks to God and said to them, “Take this and pass it on to one another and drink.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I promise you that the next time we drink this wine, we will be together in the feast of God’s kingdom.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then he lifted up a loaf, and after praying a prayer of thanksgiving to God, he gave each of his apostles a piece of bread, saying, “This loaf is my body, which is now being offered to you. Always eat it to remember me.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">After supper was over, he lifted the cup again and said, “This cup is my blood of the new covenant I make with you, and it will be poured out soon for all of you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But I want you to know that the hands of the one who delivers me to be the sacrifice are with mine on the table this very moment.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The Son of Man must now go where he will be sacrificed. But there will be great and unending doom for the man who betrays me.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">The apostles questioned among themselves which one of them was about to do this.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The disciples bickered over which one of them would be considered the greatest in the kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus interrupted their argument, saying, “The kings and men of authority in this world rule oppressively over their subjects, claiming that they do it for the good of the people. They are obsessed with how others see them.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But this is not your calling. You will lead by a different model. The greatest one among you will live as one called to serve others without honor. The greatest honor and authority is reserved for the one who has a servant heart.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The leaders who are served are the most important in your eyes, but in the kingdom, it is the servants who lead. Am I not here with you as one who serves?</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Because you have stood with me through all my trials and ordeals,</verse>
				<verse number="29">I am promising you the kingdom that the Father has promised me.</verse>
				<verse number="30">We will celebrate in this kingdom and you will feast with me at my table. And each of you will be given a throne, twelve thrones in all, and you will be made rulers on thrones to judge the tribes of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">“Peter, my dear friend, listen to what I’m about to tell you. Satan has obtained permission to come and sift you all like wheat and test your faith.</verse>
				<verse number="32">But I have prayed for you, Peter, that you would stay faithful to me no matter what comes. Remember this: after you have turned back to me and have been restored, make it your life mission to strengthen the faith of your brothers.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">“But Lord,” Peter replied, “I am ready to stand with you to the very end, even if it means prison or death!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus looked at him and prophesied, “Before the rooster crows in the morning, you will deny three times that you even know me.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then he said to all of them, “When I sent you out empty-handed, did you lack anything?” “Not a thing,” they answered. “God provided all we needed.” Jesus said, “But now I say to you: Take what you need.</verse>
				<verse number="36">If you have money, take it —and a knapsack and a sword. Danger is imminent.</verse>
				<verse number="37">For the prophetic Scripture about me ‘He will be accused of being a criminal’ will now come to pass. All that was prophesied of me will be fulfilled.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">The disciples told him, “Lord, we already have two swords!” “You still don’t understand,” Jesus responded.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Jesus left the upper room with his disciples and, as was his habit, went to the Mount of Olives, his place of secret prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="40">There he told the apostles, “Keep praying for strength to be spared from the severe test of your faith that is about to come.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Then he withdrew from them a short distance to be alone. Kneeling down, he prayed,</verse>
				<verse number="42">“Father, if you are willing, take this cup of agony away from me. But no matter what, your will must be mine.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">Jesus called for an angel of glory to strengthen him, and the angel appeared.</verse>
				<verse number="44">He prayed even more passionately, like one being sacrificed, until he was in such intense agony of spirit that his sweat became drops of blood, dripping onto the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="45">When Jesus finished praying, he got up and went to his disciples and found them all asleep, for they were exhausted and overwhelmed with sorrow.</verse>
				<verse number="46">“Why are you sleeping?” he asked them. “You need to be alert and pray for the strength to endure the great temptation.”</verse>
				<verse number="47">No sooner had he finished speaking when suddenly a mob approached, and in front of the mob was his disciple Judas. He walked up close to Jesus and greeted him with a kiss. For he had agreed to give the religious leaders a sign, saying, “The one I kiss is the one to seize.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">Jesus looked at him with sorrow and said, “A kiss, Judas? Are you really going to betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</verse>
				<verse number="49">When the other disciples understood what was happening, they asked, “Lord, shall we fight them with our swords?”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Just then, one of the disciples swung his sword at the high priest’s servant and slashed off his right ear.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Jesus stopped the incident from escalating any further by saying, “Enough of this!” Then he touched the right side of the injured man’s head and the ear grew back —he was healed!</verse>
				<verse number="52">Jesus turned to those who had come to seize him—the ruling priests, the officers of the temple police, and the religious leaders—and said, “Am I a criminal that you come to capture me with clubs and swords? Wasn’t I with you day after day, teaching in the temple courts?</verse>
				<verse number="53">You could have seized me at any time. But in the darkness of night you have now found your time, for it belongs to you and to the prince of darkness.”</verse>
				<verse number="54">The religious leaders seized Jesus and led him away, but Peter followed from a safe distance. They brought him to the home of the high priest, where people were already gathered out in the courtyard.</verse>
				<verse number="55">Someone had built a fire, so Peter inched closer and sat down among them to stay warm.</verse>
				<verse number="56">A girl noticed Peter sitting in the firelight. Staring at him, she pointed him out and said, “This man is one of Jesus’ disciples!”</verse>
				<verse number="57">Peter flatly denied it, saying, “What are you talking about, girl? I don’t know him!”</verse>
				<verse number="58">A little while later, someone else spotted Peter and said, “I recognize you. You’re one of his, I know it!” Peter again said, “I’m not one of his disciples.”</verse>
				<verse number="59">About an hour later, someone else identified Peter and insisted he was a disciple of Jesus, saying, “Look at him! He’s from Galilee, just like Jesus. I know he’s one of them.”</verse>
				<verse number="60">But Peter was adamant. “Listen, I don’t know what you’re talking about. Don’t you understand? I don’t even know him.” While the words were still in his mouth, the rooster crowed.</verse>
				<verse number="61">At that moment, the Lord, who was being led through the courtyard by his captors, turned around and gazed at Peter. All at once Peter remembered the words Jesus had prophesied over him, “Before the rooster crows in the morning, you will deny three times that you even know me.”</verse>
				<verse number="62">Peter burst into tears, ran off from the crowd, and wept bitterly.</verse>
				<verse number="63">Those who were guarding Jesus mocked and beat him severely.</verse>
				<verse number="64">They also made fun of him, blindfolding him and slapping his face and saying, “Prove that you are a prophet and tell us which one of us hit you!”</verse>
				<verse number="65">They blasphemed and heaped insult after insult upon him.</verse>
				<verse number="66">At daybreak the high priests, the experts of the law, and the top religious leaders convened and had Jesus brought before their council.</verse>
				<verse number="67">They asked him point blank, “Tell us, are you the Christ, the Messiah, or not?” Jesus responded, “If I tell you the truth, you won’t believe me.</verse>
				<verse number="68">And if I question you, you will not answer me or release me.</verse>
				<verse number="69">But from today on, the Son of Man will be enthroned in the place of honor, power, and authority with Almighty God.”</verse>
				<verse number="70">They all shouted, “Then you do claim to be the Son of God?” He said to them, “You are the ones who say I am.”</verse>
				<verse number="71">They all shouted, “We’ve heard it from his very lips! What further proof do we need?”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="23">
				<verse number="1">The entire council stood at once and took Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They accused him of false testimony, saying, “This man tells us not to pay our taxes to Caesar. And he proclaims himself to be Christ the King and Messiah. He’s a deceiver of our nation.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Pilate asked Jesus, “Is this true? Are you their king and Messiah?” Jesus answered, “It is true.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Pilate turned to the high priests and to the gathered crowd and said, “This man has committed no crime. I find nothing wrong with him.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But they yelled and demanded that Pilate do something, saying, “He has stirred up our nation, misleading people from the moment he began teaching in Galilee until he has come here to Jerusalem!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">When Pilate heard the word Galilee, he asked if Jesus was a Galilean, and when they told him “yes,” Pilate saw a way out of his problem. He knew that Antipas, son of Herod, ruled over Galilee, and he happened to be in Jerusalem at that time, so Pilate sent Jesus to Antipas.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">When he saw Jesus, he was elated, for he had heard a great deal about his ministry and wanted Jesus to perform a miracle in front of him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Antipas questioned him at length, but Jesus wouldn’t even answer him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">All the while the high priests and religious leaders stood by, accusing Jesus of wrongdoing, so that Antipas and his soldiers treated him with scorn and mocking. Antipas put an elegant purple robe on Jesus and sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
				<verse number="11"></verse>
				<verse number="12">That day, Antipas and Pilate healed their long-standing feud and they became good friends.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Pilate gathered together the people, the high priests, and all the religious leaders of the nation. He told them, “You have presented this man to me and charged him with stirring a rebellion among the people. I have examined him here in your presence and have put him on trial. My verdict is that none of your charges against him are true. I find no fault in him.</verse>
				<verse number="14"></verse>
				<verse number="15">Then I sent him to Antipas, son of Herod, who questioned him and found him not guilty. Since he has done nothing deserving of death, I have decided to punish him with a severe flogging and release him.”</verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">For it was Pilate’s custom to honor the Jewish holiday by releasing a prisoner.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When the crowd heard this, they went wild. Erupting with anger, they cried out, “No! Take this one away and release Barabbas!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">For Barabbas had been thrown in prison for robbery and murder.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, tried to convince them it was best to let Jesus go,</verse>
				<verse number="21">but they screamed out over and over, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">A third time, Pilate asked the crowd, “What evil crime has this man committed that I should have him crucified? I haven’t found one thing that warrants a death sentence! I will have him flogged severely and then release him.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">But the people and the high priests, shouting like a mob, screamed out at the top of their lungs, “No! Crucify him! Crucify him!” Finally their shouts and screams succeeded.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Pilate caved in to the crowd and ordered that the will of the people be done.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then he released the guilty murderer Barabbas, as they had insisted, and handed Jesus over to be crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="26">As the guards led Jesus to be crucified, there was an African man in the crowd named Simon, from Libya. He had just arrived from a rural village to keep the Feast of the Passover. The guards laid Jesus’ cross on Simon’s shoulders and forced him to walk behind Jesus, carrying his cross.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Massive crowds gathered to follow Jesus, including a number of women, who were wailing with sorrow over him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me. You should be weeping for yourselves and your children.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The day is coming when it will not be the women with children who are blessed but those who are childless. Then you will say, ‘The barren women are the most fortunate! Those who have never given birth and never nursed a child— they are more fortunate than we, for they will never see their children put to death!’</verse>
				<verse number="30">And the people will cry out for the mountains and hills to fall on top of them to hide them from all that is to come.</verse>
				<verse number="31">For if this is what they do to the living Branch, what will they do with the dead ones?”</verse>
				<verse number="32">The guards led away two criminals with Jesus, to execute all three at the same time.</verse>
				<verse number="33">When they came to the place that is known as The Skull, the guards crucified Jesus, nailing him on the center cross between the two criminals.</verse>
				<verse number="34">While they were nailing Jesus to the cross, he prayed over and over, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they’re doing.” The soldiers, after they crucified him, gambled over his clothing.</verse>
				<verse number="35">A great crowd gathered to watch what was happening. The religious leaders sneered at Jesus and mocked him, saying, “Look at this man! What kind of ‘chosen Messiah’ is this? He pretended to save others, but he can’t even save himself!”</verse>
				<verse number="36">The soldiers joined in the mockery, offering Jesus a drink of vinegar.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Over Jesus’ head on the cross was written an inscription in Greek, Latin, and Aramaic: “This man is the king of all the Jews.” And all the soldiers laughed and scoffed at him, saying, “Hey! If you’re the king of Jews, why don’t you save yourself?”</verse>
				<verse number="38"></verse>
				<verse number="39">One of the criminals hanging on the cross next to Jesus kept ridiculing him, saying, “What kind of Messiah are you? Save yourself and save us from this death!”</verse>
				<verse number="40">The criminal hanging on the other cross rebuked the man, saying, “Don’t you fear God? You’re about to die!</verse>
				<verse number="41">We deserve to be condemned. We’re just being repaid for what we’ve done. But this man—he’s done nothing wrong!”</verse>
				<verse number="42">Then he said, “I beg of you, Jesus, show me grace and take me with you into your everlasting kingdom!”</verse>
				<verse number="43">Jesus responded, “I promise you—this very day you will enter paradise with me.”</verse>
				<verse number="44">It was now only midday, yet the whole world became dark for three hours as the light of the sun faded away.</verse>
				<verse number="45">And suddenly in the temple the thick veil hanging in the Holy Place was ripped in two!</verse>
				<verse number="46">Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Father, I surrender my Spirit into your hands.” And he took his last breath and died.</verse>
				<verse number="47">When the Roman captain overseeing the crucifixion witnessed all that took place, he was awestruck and glorified God. Acknowledging what they had done, he said, “I have no doubt; we just killed the righteous one.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">The crowds that had gathered to observe this spectacle went back to their homes, overcome with deep sorrow and devastated by what they had witnessed.</verse>
				<verse number="49">But standing off at a distance were some who truly knew Jesus, and the women who had followed him all the way from Galilee were keeping vigil.</verse>
				<verse number="50">There was also a member of the Jewish council named Joseph, from the village of Ramah, a good-hearted, honorable man who was eager for God’s kingdom to appear. He had strongly disagreed with the decision of the council to crucify Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="51"></verse>
				<verse number="52">He came before Pilate and asked permission to take the body of Jesus for a proper burial, and Pilate granted his request.</verse>
				<verse number="53">So he took the body from the cross, wrapped it in a winding sheet of linen, and placed it in a new, unused tomb chiseled out of solid rock.</verse>
				<verse number="54">It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was fast approaching.</verse>
				<verse number="55">The women who had been companions of Jesus from the beginning saw all this take place and carefully contemplated how the body was laid in the tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Afterward they returned home and prepared fragrant spices and ointments and were planning to anoint his body after the Sabbath was completed, according to the commandments of the law.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="24">
				<verse number="1">Very early that Sunday morning, the women made their way to the tomb, carrying the spices they had prepared. (10) Among them were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Jesus’ mother Mary.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Arriving at the tomb they discovered that the huge stone covering the entrance had been rolled aside,</verse>
				<verse number="3">so they went in to look. But the tomb was empty. The body of Jesus was gone!</verse>
				<verse number="4">They stood there, stunned and perplexed. Suddenly, two men appeared above them in dazzling white robes shining like lightning.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Terrified, the women fell to the ground on their faces. The men in white said to them, “Why would you look for the Living One in a tomb? He is not here, for he has risen!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Have you forgotten what he said to you while he was still in Galilee:</verse>
				<verse number="7">‘The destiny of the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinful men, to be nailed to a cross, and on the third day to rise again’?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">All at once they remembered his words.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Leaving the tomb, they went to break the news to the Eleven and to all the others of what they had seen and heard.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">When the disciples heard the testimony of the women, it made no sense, and they were unable to believe what they heard.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But Peter jumped up and ran the entire distance to the tomb to see for himself. Stooping down, he looked inside and discovered it was empty! There was only the linen sheet lying there. Staggered by this, he walked away, wondering what it meant.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Later that same day, two of Jesus’ disciples were walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus, a journey of about seventeen miles.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They were in the midst of a discussion about all the events of the last few days when Jesus walked up and accompanied them in their journey.</verse>
				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16">They were unaware that it was actually Jesus walking alongside them, for God prevented them from recognizing him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus said to them, “You seem to be in a deep discussion about something. What are you talking about, so sad and gloomy?” They stopped, and the one named Cleopas answered, “Haven’t you heard? Are you the only one in Jerusalem unaware of the things that have happened over the last few days?”</verse>
				<verse number="18"></verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus asked, “What things?” “The things about Jesus, the man from Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a mighty prophet of God who performed miracles and wonders. His words were powerful and he had great favor with God and the people.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But three days ago the high priest and the rulers of the people sentenced him to death and had him crucified. We had all hoped that he was the one who would redeem and rescue Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="21"></verse>
				<verse number="22">Early this morning, some of the women informed us of something amazing.</verse>
				<verse number="23">They said they went to the tomb and found it empty. They claimed two angels appeared and told them that Jesus is now alive.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Some of us went to see for ourselves and found the tomb exactly as the women had said. But no one has seen him.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus said to them, “Why are you so thick-headed? Why do you find it so hard to believe every word the prophets have spoken?</verse>
				<verse number="26">Wasn’t it necessary for the Messiah to experience all these sufferings and afterward to enter into his glory?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">And beginning with Moses and all the prophets he carefully unveiled to them the revelation of himself throughout the Scriptures.</verse>
				<verse number="28">As they approached the village, Jesus walked on ahead, telling them he was going on to a distant place.</verse>
				<verse number="29">They urged him to remain there with them and pleaded, “Stay with us. It will be dark soon.” So Jesus went with them into the village.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Joining them at the table for supper, he took bread and blessed it and broke it, then gave it to them.</verse>
				<verse number="31">All at once their eyes were opened and they realized he was Jesus! Then suddenly, in a flash, Jesus vanished from before their eyes!</verse>
				<verse number="32">Stunned, they looked at each other and said, “Why didn’t we recognize him? Didn’t our hearts burn with the flames of holy passion while we walked beside him? He unveiled for us such profound revelation from the Scriptures!”</verse>
				<verse number="33">They left at once and hurried back to Jerusalem to tell the other disciples. When they found the Eleven and the other disciples all together,</verse>
				<verse number="34">they overheard them saying, “It’s really true! The Lord has risen from the dead. He even appeared to Peter!”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then the two disciples told the others what had happened to them on the road to Emmaus and how Jesus had unveiled himself in the breaking of bread.</verse>
				<verse number="36">While they were still discussing all of this, Jesus suddenly appeared right in front of their eyes! Startled and terrified, the disciples were convinced they were seeing a ghost. Standing there among them he said, “Be at peace. I am the living God. Don’t be afraid.</verse>
				<verse number="37"></verse>
				<verse number="38">Why are you so frightened? Don’t let doubt enter your hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="39">See my pierced hands and feet. See for yourselves, it is I, standing here alive. Touch me and know that my wounds are real. A spirit does not have a body of flesh and bone as you see that I have.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Then he showed them his pierced hands and feet and let them touch his wounds.</verse>
				<verse number="41">The disciples were ecstatic, yet dumbfounded, unable to fully comprehend it. Knowing that they were still wondering if he was real, Jesus said, “Here, let me show you. Give me something to eat.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">They handed him a piece of broiled fish and some honeycomb. And they watched him eat.</verse>
				<verse number="43"></verse>
				<verse number="44">Then he said to them, “Don’t you remember the words that I spoke to you when I was still with you? I told you that I would fulfill everything written about me, including all the prophecies from the law of Moses through the Psalms and the writings of the prophets.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">He supernaturally unlocked their understanding to receive the revelation of the Scriptures,</verse>
				<verse number="46">and said to them, “Everything that has happened fulfills what the Scriptures prophesied of me. The Messiah was destined to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Now you must go into all the nations and preach repentance and forgiveness of sins so that they will turn to me. Start right here in Jerusalem,</verse>
				<verse number="48">for you are my witnesses and have seen for yourselves all that has transpired.</verse>
				<verse number="49">I will send the fulfillment of the Father’s promise to you, so stay here in the city until you are clothed with the mighty power of heaven.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Jesus led his disciples out to Bethany. He lifted his hands over them and blessed them in his love.</verse>
				<verse number="51">While he was still speaking words of love and blessing, he floated off the ground into the sky, ascending into heaven before their very eyes!</verse>
				<verse number="52">And all they could do was worship him. Overwhelmed and ecstatic with joy, they made their way back to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="53">Every day they went to the temple, to praise and worship God.</verse>
			</chapter>

		<book number="43">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">In the beginning the Living Expression was already there. And the Living Expression was with God, yet fully God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They were together— face-to-face, in the very beginning.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And through his creative inspiration this Living Expression made all things, for nothing has existence apart from him!</verse>
				<verse number="4">A fountain of life was in him, for his life is light for all humanity.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And this Light never fails to shine through darkness— Light that darkness could not overcome!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Suddenly a man appeared who was sent from God, a messenger named John.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For he came as a witness, to point the way to the Light of Life, and to help everyone believe.</verse>
				<verse number="8">John was not that Light but he came to show who is. For he was merely a messenger to speak the truth about the Light.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For the perfect Light of Truth was coming into the world and shine upon everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He entered into the world he created, yet the world was unaware.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He came to the people he created — to those who should have received him, but they did not recognize him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But those who embraced him and took hold of his name he gave authority to become the children of God!</verse>
				<verse number="13">He was not born by the joining of human parents or from natural means, or by a man’s desire, but he was born of God.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And so the Living Expression became a man and lived among us! We gazed upon his glory, the glory of the One and Only who came from the Father overflowing with tender mercy and truth!</verse>
				<verse number="15">John announced the truth about him when he taught the people, “He’s the One! He’s the One I’ve been telling you would come after me, even though he ranks far above me, because he existed before I was even born.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">And from the overflow of his fullness we received grace heaped upon more grace!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Moses gave us the Law, but Jesus, the Anointed One, unveils truth wrapped in tender mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="18">No one ever before gazed upon the full splendor of God except his uniquely beloved Son, who is cherished by the Father and held close to his heart. Now that he has come to us, he has unfolded the full explanation of who God truly is!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now this was John’s testimony when some of the Jewish leaders sent an entourage of priests and temple servants from Jerusalem to interrogate him. “Who are you?” they asked him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">John answered them directly, saying, “I am not the Messiah!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Then who are you?” they asked. “Are you Elijah?” “No,” John replied. So they pressed him further, “Are you the prophet Moses said was coming, the one we’re expecting?” “No,” he replied.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Then who are you?” they demanded. “We need an answer for those who sent us. Tell us something about yourself—anything!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">John answered them, “I am an urgent, thunderous voice crying out in the desert—clear the way and prepare your hearts for the coming of the Lord Yahweh!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then some members of the religious sect known as the Pharisees questioned John,</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Why do you baptize the people if you are neither the Messiah, Elijah, nor the Prophet?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">John answered them, “I baptize the people in this river, but the One who will take my place is to be more honored than I, but even when he stands among you, you will not recognize or embrace him! I am not worthy enough to stoop down in front of him and untie his sandals!”</verse>
				<verse number="27"></verse>
				<verse number="28">All these events took place at Bethany, where John was baptizing at the place of the crossing of the Jordan River.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The very next day, John saw Jesus coming to him to be baptized, and John cried out, “Look! There he is—God’s Lamb! He takes away the sin of the entire world!</verse>
				<verse number="30">I told you that a Mighty One would come who is far greater than I am, because he existed long before I was born!</verse>
				<verse number="31">My baptism was for the preparation of his appearing to Israel, even though I didn’t recognize him.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then, as he baptized Jesus, he proclaimed these words: “I see the Spirit of God appear like a dove descending from the heavenly realm and landing upon him—and it remained on him!</verse>
				<verse number="33">Before this I didn’t know who he was. But the one who sent me to baptize with water had told me, ‘You will see the Spirit come down and stay on someone. He will be the One I have sent to baptize with the Holy Spirit.’</verse>
				<verse number="34">Now I have seen this happen and I can tell you for sure that this man is the Son of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">The next day, Jesus walked right past where John and two of his disciples were standing. John, gazing upon Jesus, pointed to him and prophesied, “Look! There’s God’s sacrificial Lamb!”</verse>
				<verse number="36"></verse>
				<verse number="37">And as soon as John’s two disciples heard this, they immediately left John and began to follow a short distance behind Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Jesus turned around and saw they were following him and asked, “What do you want?” They responded, “Rabbi (which means, Master Teacher), where are you staying?”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Jesus answered, “Come and discover for yourselves.” So they went with him and saw where he was staying, and since it was late in the afternoon, they spent the rest of the day with Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="40">One of the two disciples who heard John’s words and began to follow Jesus was a man named Andrew. He first found his brother, Simon Peter, and told him, “We have found the Anointed One!” (Which is translated, the Christ.)</verse>
				<verse number="41"></verse>
				<verse number="42">Then Andrew brought Simon to meet Jesus. When he gazed upon Andrew’s brother, he prophesied to him, “You are Simon and your father’s name is John. But from now on, everyone will call you Cephas” (which means, Peter the Rock).</verse>
				<verse number="43">The next day, Jesus decided to go to Galilee, where he found Philip. Jesus said to him, “Come and follow me.”</verse>
				<verse number="44">(Now Philip, Andrew, and Peter had all grown up together in the village of Bethsaida.)</verse>
				<verse number="45">Philip went to look for his friend, Nathanael, and told him, “We’ve found him! We’ve found the One we’ve been waiting for! It’s Jesus, son of Joseph from Nazareth! He’s the One whom Moses and the prophets prophesied would come!”</verse>
				<verse number="46">Nathanael sneered, “Nazareth! What good thing could ever come from Nazareth?” Philip answered, “Come and let’s find out!”</verse>
				<verse number="47">When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said, “Here comes a true son of Israel—an honest man with no hidden motive!”</verse>
				<verse number="48">Nathanael was stunned and said, “But you’ve never met me—how do you know anything about me?” Jesus answered, “Nathanael, right before Philip came to you, I saw you sitting under the shade of a fig tree.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">Nathanael blurted out, “Teacher, you are truly the Son of God and the King of Israel!”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Jesus answered, “Do you believe simply because I told you I saw you sitting under a fig tree? You will experience even more impressive things than that!</verse>
				<verse number="51">I prophesy to you eternal truth: From now on, you all will see an open heaven and gaze upon the Son of Man like a stairway reaching into the sky with the messengers of God climbing up and down upon him!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Now on the third day, Jesus’ mother went to a wedding feast in the Galilean village of Cana.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Jesus and his disciples were all invited to the banquet, but with so many guests, they ran out of wine. And when Mary realized it, she came to Jesus and asked, “They have no wine; can’t you do something about it?”</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus replied, “My dear one, don’t you understand that if I do this, it will change nothing for you, but it will change everything for me! My hour of unveiling my power has not yet come.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Mary then went to the servers and told them, “Whatever Jesus tells you, do it!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Nearby stood six stone water pots meant to be used for the Jewish washing rituals. Each one could hold about twenty gallons or more.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jesus came to the servers and instructed them, “Fill the pots with water, right up to the very brim. ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then he said, “Now fill your pitchers and take them to the master of ceremonies.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">And when they poured out their pitchers for the master of ceremonies to sample, the water had become wine! When he tasted the water that had become wine, the master of ceremonies was impressed with its quality. (Although he didn’t know where the wine had come from, only the servers knew.) He called the bridegroom over</verse>
				<verse number="10">and said to him, “Every host serves his best wine first, until everyone has had a cup or two, then he serves the cheaper wine. But you, my friend, you’ve reserved the most exquisite wine until now!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">This miracle in Cana was the first of the many extraordinary miracles Jesus performed in Galilee that revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">After the wedding, Jesus, his mother and brothers, and his disciples traveled to Capernaum and stayed there for a few days.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When the time was close for the Jewish Passover to begin, Jesus walked to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="14">As he went into the temple courtyard, he noticed it was filled with merchants selling oxen, lambs, and doves for exorbitant prices, while others were overcharging as they exchanged currency behind their counters.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So Jesus found some cords and made them into a whip. Then he drove out every one of them and their animals from the courtyard of the temple, and he kicked over their tables filled with money, scattering it everywhere!</verse>
				<verse number="16">And he told the merchants, “Get these things out of here! Don’t you dare commercialize my Father’s house!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">That’s when his disciples remembered the Scripture: “I am consumed with a fiery passion to keep your house pure!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then the Jewish religious leaders challenged Jesus, “What authority do you have to do this sort of thing and what supernatural sign will you show us to prove it?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus answered, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up again in three days.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then the Jewish leaders sneered at Jesus’ answer, “This temple took forty-six years to build, and you mean to tell us that you will raise it up in three days?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">But they failed to understand that Jesus was speaking of the “temple” of his body.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The disciples remembered his prophecy after Jesus rose from the dead, and believed both the Scripture and what Jesus had said.</verse>
				<verse number="23">While Jesus was at the Passover Feast, the number of his followers began to grow, and many gave their allegiance to him because of all the miraculous signs they had seen him doing!</verse>
				<verse number="24">But Jesus did not yet entrust himself to them, because he knew how fickle human hearts can be.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He needed no one to tell him about human nature, for he fully understood what man was capable of doing.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Now there was a prominent religious leader among the Jews named Nicodemus, who was part of the sect called the Pharisees.</verse>
				<verse number="2">One night he discreetly came to Jesus and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one performs the miracle signs that you do, unless God’s power is with him.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus answered, “Nicodemus, listen to this eternal truth: Before a person can even perceive God’s kingdom, they must first experience a rebirth.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Nicodemus said, “Rebirth? How can a gray-headed man be reborn? It’s impossible for anyone to go back into the womb a second time and be reborn!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Jesus answered, “I speak an eternal truth: Unless you are born of water and the Spirit, you will never enter God’s kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For the natural realm only gives birth to things that are natural, but the spiritual realm gives birth to supernatural life!</verse>
				<verse number="7">“You shouldn’t be amazed by my statement, ‘You all must be born from above!’</verse>
				<verse number="8">For the Spirit-Wind blows as it chooses. You can hear its sound, but you don’t know where it came from or where it’s going. So it is the same with those who are Spirit-born!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Nicodemus replied, “I don’t understand; what do you mean? How does this happen?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus answered, “Nicodemus, aren’t you the respected teacher in Israel, and yet you don’t understand this revelation?</verse>
				<verse number="11">I speak eternal truths about things I know, things I’ve seen and experienced—and still you don’t accept what I reveal.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If you’re unable to believe what I’ve told you about the natural realm, what will you do when I begin to unveil the heavenly realm?</verse>
				<verse number="13">No one has risen into the heavenly realm except the Son of Man who also exists in heaven.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“And just as Moses in the desert lifted up the brass replica of a venomous snake on a pole for all the people to see and be healed, so the Son of Man is ready to be lifted up,</verse>
				<verse number="15">so that those who truly believe in him will not perish but be given eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For here is the way God loved the world—he gave his only, unique Son as a gift. So now everyone who believes in him will never perish but experience everlasting life.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“God did not send his Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, but to be its Savior and rescue it!</verse>
				<verse number="18">So now there is no longer any condemnation for those who believe in him, but the unbeliever already lives under condemnation because they do not believe in the name of the only Son of God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And here is the basis for their judgment: The Light of God has now come into the world, but the people loved darkness more than the Light, because they want the darkness to conceal their evil.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So the wicked hate the Light and try to hide from it, for the Light fully exposes their lives.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But those who love the truth will come into the Light, for the Light will reveal that it was God who produced their fruitful works.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then Jesus and his disciples left for a length of time into the Judean countryside where they baptized the people.</verse>
				<verse number="23">At this time John was still baptizing people at Aenon, near Salim, where there was plenty of water, and the people kept coming for John to baptize them.</verse>
				<verse number="24">(This was before John was thrown into prison.)</verse>
				<verse number="25">An argument started between John’s disciples and a particular Jewish man about baptism.</verse>
				<verse number="26">So they went to John and asked him, “Teacher, are you aware that the One you told us about at the crossing place—he’s now baptizing crowds larger than yours. People are flocking to him!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">John answered them, “A person cannot receive even one thing unless God bestows it.</verse>
				<verse number="28">You’ve heard me tell you that I am not the Messiah, but certainly I am the messenger sent ahead of him.</verse>
				<verse number="29">He is the Bridegroom, and the bride belongs to him. I am the friend of the Bridegroom who stands nearby and listens with great joy to the Bridegroom’s voice. Because of his words, my joy is complete and overflows!</verse>
				<verse number="30">It is necessary for him to increase and for me to decrease.</verse>
				<verse number="31">“For the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks from the natural realm. But the One who comes from above is above everything and speaks of the highest realm of all!</verse>
				<verse number="32">His message is about what he has seen and experienced, even though people don’t accept it.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Yet those who embrace his message know in their hearts that it’s the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="34">“The One whom God has sent to represent him will speak the words of God, because God has poured out upon him the fullness of the Holy Spirit without limitation.</verse>
				<verse number="35">The Father loves his Son so much that he has given all things into his hands.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Those who trust in the Son possess eternal life; those who don’t obey the Son will not see life, and God’s anger will rise up against them.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">The news quickly reached the Jewish religious leaders known as the Pharisees that Jesus was drawing greater crowds of followers coming to be baptized than John.</verse>
				<verse number="2">(Although Jesus himself didn’t baptize, but only his disciples.)</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus heard what was being said and abruptly left Judea and returned to the province of Galilee,</verse>
				<verse number="4">and he had to pass through Samaria.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Jesus arrived at the Samaritan village of Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Wearied by his long journey, he sat on the edge of Jacob’s well, and sent his disciples into the village to buy food, for it was already afternoon. Soon a Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.”</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">She replied, “Why would a Jewish man ask a Samaritan woman for a drink of water?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus replied, “If you only knew who I am and the gift that God wants to give you, you’d ask me for a drink, and I would give you living water.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">The woman replied, “But sir, you don’t even have a bucket, and the well is very deep. So where do you find this ‘living water’?</verse>
				<verse number="12">Do you really think that you are greater than our ancestor Jacob who dug this well and drank from it himself, along with his children and livestock?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Jesus answered, “If you drink from Jacob’s well, you’ll be thirsty again,</verse>
				<verse number="14">but if anyone drinks the living water I give them, they will never be thirsty again. For when you drink the water I give you, it becomes a gushing fountain of the Holy Spirit, flooding you with endless life!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">The woman replied, “Let me drink that water so I’ll never be thirsty again and won’t have to come back here to draw water.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Jesus said, “Go get your husband and bring him back here.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“But I’m not married,” the woman answered. “That’s true,” Jesus said,</verse>
				<verse number="18">“for you’ve been married five times, and now you’re living with a man who is not your husband. You have told the truth.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">The woman changed the subject. “You must be a prophet!</verse>
				<verse number="20">So tell me this: Why do our fathers worship God on this nearby mountain, but your people teach that Jerusalem is the place where we must worship. Who is right?” Jesus responded,</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Believe me, dear woman, the time has come when you will worship the Father neither on a mountain nor in Jerusalem, but in your heart.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Your people don’t really know the One they worship, but we Jews worship out of our experience, for it’s from the Jews that salvation is available.</verse>
				<verse number="23">From now on, worshiping the Father will not be a matter of the right place but with a right heart. For God is a Spirit, and he longs to have sincere worshipers who adore him in the realm of the Spirit and in truth.”</verse>
				<verse number="24"></verse>
				<verse number="25">The woman said, “ This is all so confusing, but I do know that the Anointed One is coming—the true Messiah. And when he comes, he will tell us everything we need to know.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Jesus said to her, “You don’t have to wait any longer, the Anointed One is here speaking with you—I am the One you’re looking for.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">At that moment, his disciples returned and were stunned to see Jesus speaking with a Samaritan woman, yet none of them dared ask him why or what they were discussing.</verse>
				<verse number="28">All at once, the woman left her water jar and ran off to her village and told everyone,</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Come and meet a man at the well who told me everything I’ve ever done! He could be the One we’ve been waiting for.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Hearing this, the people came streaming out of the village to go see Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then the disciples began to insist that Jesus eat some of the food they brought back with them, saying, “Teacher, you must eat something.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">But Jesus told them, “I have eaten a meal you don’t know about.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Puzzled by this, the disciples began to discuss it among themselves, “Did someone already bring him food?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">To clarify, Jesus spoke up and said, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and bring it to completion.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">As the crowds emerged from the village, Jesus said to his disciples, “Why would you say, ‘The harvest is another four months away’? Look at all the people coming—now is harvest time! Their hearts are like vast fields of ripened grain—ready for a harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Everyone who reaps these souls for eternal life will receive a reward. Both those who plant spiritual seeds and those who reap the spiritual harvest will celebrate together with great joy!</verse>
				<verse number="37">And this confirms the saying, ‘One sows the seed and another reaps the harvest.’</verse>
				<verse number="38">I have sent you out to harvest a field that you haven’t planted, where many others have labored long and hard before you. And now you are privileged to profit from their labors and reap the harvest.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Many from the Samaritan village became believers in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony: “He told me everything I ever did!”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Then they begged Jesus to stay with them, so he stayed there for two days,</verse>
				<verse number="41">resulting in many more coming to faith in him because of his message.</verse>
				<verse number="42">The Samaritans said to the woman, “Now we’ve heard him ourselves. We no longer believe just because of what you told us, but we’re convinced that he really is the true Savior of the world!”</verse>
				<verse number="43">On the third day Jesus left there and continued his journey to Galilee, where he had been raised.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Now Jesus knew that prophets are honored everywhere except in their own hometown.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Even so, as Jesus arrived in the province of Galilee, the people welcomed him with open arms. Many of them had been in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival and had witnessed firsthand the miracles he had performed.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Jesus entered the village of Cana of Galilee where he had transformed water into wine. He met there a governmental official from Capernaum whose son was very sick and dying. When he heard that Jesus had left Judea and was staying in Cana of Galilee, he decided to make the journey to Cana. When he found Jesus, he begged him, “You must come with me to Capernaum and heal my son!”</verse>
				<verse number="47"></verse>
				<verse number="48">So Jesus said to him, “You never believe unless you see signs and wonders.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">But the man continued to plead, “Come with me to Capernaum before my little boy dies!”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Jesus looked him in the eyes and said, “Go back home now. I promise you, your son will live.” The man believed in his heart the words of Jesus and set off for home.</verse>
				<verse number="51">When he was still a distance from Capernaum, his servants met him on the road and told him the good news, “Your son is healed! He’s alive!”</verse>
				<verse number="52">Overjoyed, the father asked his servants, “When did my son begin to recover?” “Yesterday,” they said, “at one in the afternoon. All at once his fever broke— and now he’s well!”</verse>
				<verse number="53">Then the father immediately realized that it was at that very same hour that Jesus spoke the words to him, “Your son will live.” From that day forward, the man, his servants, and all his family believed.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Healing the official’s son was Jesus’ second extraordinary miracle in Galilee after returning from Judea.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">From Galilee, Jesus returned to Jerusalem to observe one of the Jewish feasts.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Inside the city, near the Sheep Gate, there is a pool called in Aramaic, The House of Loving Kindness, surrounded by five covered porches.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Hundreds of sick people were lying under the covered porches—the paralyzed, the blind, and the crippled—all of them waiting for their healing.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For an angel of God periodically descended into the pool to stir the waters, and the first one who stepped into the pool after the waters swirled would instantly be healed.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Among the many sick people lying there was a man who had been disabled for thirty-eight years.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When Jesus saw him lying there, he knew that the man had been crippled for a long time. Jesus said to him, “Do you truly long to be well?”</verse>
				<verse number="7">The sick man answered, “Sir, there’s no way I can get healed, for I have no one to lower me into the water when the angel comes. As soon as I try to crawl to the edge of the pool, someone else jumps in ahead of me.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus said to him, “Stand up! Pick up your sleeping mat and you will walk!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Immediately he stood up—he was healed! So he rolled up his mat and walked again! Now Jesus worked this miracle on the Sabbath.</verse>
				<verse number="10">When the Jewish leaders saw the man walking along carrying his sleeping mat, they objected and said, “What are you doing carrying that? Don’t you know it’s the Sabbath? It’s not lawful for you to carry things on the Sabbath!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">He answered them, “The man who healed me told me to pick it up and walk.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">“What man?” they asked him. “Who was this man who ordered you to carry something on a Sabbath?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">But the healed man couldn’t give them an answer, for he didn’t yet know who it was, since Jesus had already slipped away into the crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="14">A short time later, Jesus found the man at the temple and said to him, “Look at you now! You’re healed! Walk away from your sin so that nothing worse will happen to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the man went to the Jewish leaders to inform them, “It was Jesus who healed me!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">From that day forward the Jewish leaders began to persecute Jesus because of the things he did on the Sabbath.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus answered his critics by saying, “Every day my Father is at work, and I will be, too!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">This infuriated them and made them all the more eager to devise a plan to kill him. For not only did he break their Sabbath rules, but he also called God “my Father,” which made him equal to God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">So Jesus said, “I speak to you eternal truth. The Son is unable to do anything from himself or through his own initiative. I only do the works that I see the Father doing, for the Son does the same works as his Father.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Because the Father loves his Son so much, he always reveals to him everything that he is about to do. And you will all be amazed when he shows him even greater works than what you’ve seen so far!</verse>
				<verse number="21">For just as the Father has power to raise the dead, the Son will also raise the dead and give life to whomever he wants.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“The Father judges no one, for he has given to the Son all the authority to judge.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Therefore, the honor that belongs to the Father he will now share with his Son. So if you refuse to honor the Son, you are refusing to honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“I speak to you an eternal truth: if you embrace my message and believe in the One who sent me, you will never face condemnation. In me, you have already passed from the realm of death into eternal life!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">“I speak to you an eternal truth: Soon the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who listen will arise with life!</verse>
				<verse number="26">For as the Father is the source of life, so he has given the Son the power to impart life.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The Father has transferred to the Son the authority to judge, because he is the Son of Man.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Don’t be amazed when I tell you these things, for there is a day coming when everyone who has ever died will hear my voice calling them back to life,</verse>
				<verse number="29">and they will come out of their graves! Those who have done what is good will experience a resurrection to eternal life. And those who have practiced evil will taste the resurrection of judgment!</verse>
				<verse number="30">“Nothing I do is from my own initiative. As I hear the judgment passed by my Father, I execute those judgments. And my judgments will be perfect, because I seek only to fulfill the desires of my Father who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="31">If I were to make claims about myself, you would have reasons to doubt.</verse>
				<verse number="32">But there is another who bears witness on my behalf, and I know that what he testifies of me is true.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">“You have sent messengers to John, and what he testified about me is true.</verse>
				<verse number="34">I have no need to be validated by men, but I’m explaining these things so that you will believe and be saved.</verse>
				<verse number="35">“John was a blazing, shining torch, and for a short time, you basked in his light with great joy.</verse>
				<verse number="36">But I can provide more substantial proof of who I am that exceeds John’s testimony—my miracles! These works which the Father destined for me to complete—they prove that the Father has sent me!</verse>
				<verse number="37">And my Father himself, who gave me this mission, has also testified that I am his Son. But you have never heard his voice nor seen his form,</verse>
				<verse number="38">nor does his Word truly live inside of you, for you refuse to believe in me or to embrace me as God’s messenger.</verse>
				<verse number="39">“You are busy analyzing the Scriptures, poring over them hoping to gain eternal life. Everything you read points to me,</verse>
				<verse number="40">yet you still refuse to come to me so I can give you the life you’re looking for—eternal life!</verse>
				<verse number="41">“I do not accept the honor that comes from men,</verse>
				<verse number="42">for I know what kind of people you really are, and I can see that the love of God has found no home in you.</verse>
				<verse number="43">I have come to represent my Father, yet you refuse to embrace me in faith. If someone comes in their own name and with their own agenda, you readily accept him.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Of course you’re unable to believe in me. For you live to enjoy the praises of others and not the praise that comes from the one true God.</verse>
				<verse number="45">“I will not accuse you before the Father. The one who will incriminate you is Moses, the very one you claim to obey, the one in whom you trust!</verse>
				<verse number="46">If you really believed what Moses has written, then you would embrace me, for Moses wrote about me!</verse>
				<verse number="47">But since you do not believe what he wrote, no wonder you don’t believe what I say.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">After this Jesus went to the other side of the Lake of Tiberias, which is also known as Lake Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And a massive crowd of people followed him everywhere. They were attracted by his miracles and the healings they watched him perform.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus went up the slope of a hill and sat down with his disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now it was approaching the time of the Jewish celebration of Passover, and there were many pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem in the crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="5">As Jesus sat down, he looked out and saw the massive crowd of people scrambling up the hill, for they wanted to be near him. So he turned to Philip and said, “Where will we buy enough food to feed all these people?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now Jesus already knew what he was about to do, but he said this to stretch Philip’s faith.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Philip answered, “Well, I suppose if we were to give everyone only a snack, it would cost thousands of dollars to buy enough food!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But just then, Andrew, Peter’s brother, spoke up and said,</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Look! Here’s a young person with five barley loaves and two small fish . . . but how far would that go with this huge crowd?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Have everyone sit down,” Jesus said to his disciples. So on the vast grassy slope, more than five thousand hungry people sat down.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Jesus then took the barley loaves and the fish and gave thanks to God. He then gave it to the disciples to distribute to the people. Miraculously, the food multiplied, with everyone eating as much as they wanted!</verse>
				<verse number="12">When everyone was satisfied, Jesus told his disciples, “Now go back and gather up the pieces left over so that nothing will be wasted.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">The disciples filled up twelve baskets of fragments, a basket of leftovers for each disciple.</verse>
				<verse number="14">All the people were astounded as they saw with their own eyes the incredible miracle Jesus had performed! They began to say among themselves, “He really is the One—the true prophet we’ve been expecting!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So Jesus, knowing that they were about to take him and make him their king by force, quickly left and went up the mountainside alone.</verse>
				<verse number="16">After waiting until evening for Jesus to return, the disciples went down to the lake. But as darkness fell, he still hadn’t returned, so the disciples got into a boat and headed across the lake to Capernaum.</verse>
				<verse number="17"></verse>
				<verse number="18">By now a strong wind began to blow and was stirring up the waters.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The disciples had rowed about halfway across the lake when all of a sudden they caught sight of Jesus walking on top of the waves, coming toward them. The disciples panicked,</verse>
				<verse number="20">but Jesus called out to them, “Don’t be afraid. You know who I am.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">They were relieved to take him in, and the moment Jesus stepped into the boat, they were instantly transported to the other side!</verse>
				<verse number="22">The next morning, the crowds were still on the opposite shore of the lake, near the place where they had eaten the bread he had multiplied after he had given thanks to God. Yet Jesus was nowhere to be found. They realized that only one boat had been there and that Jesus’ hadn’t boarded, and they concluded that his disciples had left him behind.</verse>
				<verse number="23"></verse>
				<verse number="24">So when the people saw on the shoreline a number of small boats from Tiberias and realized Jesus and the disciples weren’t there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to search for him.</verse>
				<verse number="25">When they finally found him, they asked him, “Teacher, how did you get here?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Jesus replied, “Let me make this very clear, you came looking for me because I fed you by a miracle, not because you believe in me.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Why would you strive for food that is perishable and not be passionate to seek the food of eternal life, which never spoils? I, the Son of Man, am ready to give you what matters most, for God the Father has destined me for this purpose.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">They replied, “So what should we do if we want to do God’s work?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus answered, “The work you can do for God starts with believing in the One he has sent.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">They replied, “Show us a miracle so we can see it, and then we’ll believe in you. Moses took care of our ancestors who were fed by the miracle of manna every day in the desert, just like the Scripture says, ‘He fed them with bread from heaven.’ What sign will you perform for us?”</verse>
				<verse number="31"></verse>
				<verse number="32">“The truth is,” Jesus said, “Moses didn’t give you the bread of heaven. It’s my Father who offers bread that comes as a dramatic sign from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The bread of God is the One who came out of heaven to give his life to feed the world.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">“Then please, sir, give us this bread every day,” they replied.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Jesus said to them, “I am the Bread of Life. Come every day to me and you will never be hungry. Believe in me and you will never be thirsty.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Yet I’ve told you that even though you’ve seen me, you still don’t believe in me.</verse>
				<verse number="37">But everyone my Father has given to me, they will come. And all who come to me, I will embrace and will never turn them away.</verse>
				<verse number="38">And I have come out of heaven not for my own desires, but for the satisfaction of my Father who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="39">My Father who sent me has determined that I will not lose even one of those he has given to me, and I will raise them up in the last day.</verse>
				<verse number="40">For the longing of my Father is that everyone who embraces the Son and believes in him will experience eternal life and I will raise them up in the last day!”</verse>
				<verse number="41">When the Jews who were hostile to Jesus heard him say, “I am the Bread that came down from heaven,” they immediately began to complain,</verse>
				<verse number="42">“How can he say these things about himself? We know him, and we know his parents. How dare he say, ‘I have come down from heaven?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="43">Jesus responded, “Stop your grumbling!</verse>
				<verse number="44">The only way people come to me is by the Father who sent me—he pulls on their hearts to embrace me. And those who are drawn to me, I will certainly raise them up in the last day.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">Jesus continued, “It has been written by the prophets, ‘They will all be taught by God himself.’ If you are really listening to the Father and learning directly from him, you will come to me.</verse>
				<verse number="46">For I am the only One who has come from the Father’s side, and I have seen the Father!</verse>
				<verse number="47">“I speak to you living truth: Unite your heart to me and believe—and you will experience eternal life!</verse>
				<verse number="48">I am the true Bread of Life.</verse>
				<verse number="49">Your ancestors ate manna in the desert and died.</verse>
				<verse number="50">But standing here before you is the true Bread that comes out of heaven, and when you eat this Bread you will never die.</verse>
				<verse number="51">I alone am this living Bread that has come to you from heaven. Eat this Bread and you will live forever. The living Bread I give you is my body, which I will offer as a sacrifice so that all may live.”</verse>
				<verse number="52">These words of Jesus sparked an angry outburst among the Jews. They protested, saying, “Does this man expect us to eat his body?”</verse>
				<verse number="53">Jesus replied to them, “Listen to this eternal truth: Unless you eat the body of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Eternal life comes to the one who eats my body and drinks my blood, and I will raise him up in the last day.</verse>
				<verse number="55">For my body is real food for your spirit and my blood is real drink.</verse>
				<verse number="56">The one who eats my body and drinks my blood lives in me and I live in him.</verse>
				<verse number="57">The Father of life sent me, and he is my life. In the same way, the one who feeds upon me, I will become his life.</verse>
				<verse number="58">I am not like the bread your ancestors ate and later died. I am the living Bread that comes from heaven. Eat this Bread and you will live forever!”</verse>
				<verse number="59">Jesus preached this sermon in the synagogue in Capernaum.</verse>
				<verse number="60">And when many of Jesus’ followers heard these things, it caused a stir. “That’s disgusting!” they said. “How could anybody accept it?”</verse>
				<verse number="61">Without anyone telling him, Jesus knew they were outraged and told them, “Are you offended over my teaching?</verse>
				<verse number="62">What will you do when you see the Son of Man ascending into the realm from where he came?</verse>
				<verse number="63">“The Holy Spirit is the one who gives life, that which is of the natural realm is of no help. The words I speak to you are Spirit and life. But there are still some of you who won’t believe.”</verse>
				<verse number="64">In fact, Jesus already knew from the beginning who the skeptics were and who his traitor would be.</verse>
				<verse number="65">He went on to say, “This is why I told you that no one embraces me unless the Father has given you to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="66">And so from that time on many of the disciples turned their backs on Jesus and refused to be associated with him.</verse>
				<verse number="67">So Jesus said to his twelve, “And you—do you also want to leave?”</verse>
				<verse number="68">Peter spoke up and said, “But Lord, where would we go? No one but you gives us the revelation of eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="69">We’re fully convinced that you are the Anointed One, the Son of the Living God, and we believe in you!”</verse>
				<verse number="70">Then Jesus shocked them with these words: “I have hand-picked you to be my twelve, knowing that one of you is the devil.”</verse>
				<verse number="71">Jesus was referring to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, for he knew that Judas, one of his chosen disciples, was getting ready to betray him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">After this Jesus traveled extensively throughout the province of Galilee, but he avoided the province of Judea, for he knew the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem were plotting to have him killed.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now the annual Feast of Tabernacles was approaching.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So Jesus’ brothers came to advise him, saying, “Why don’t you leave the countryside villages and go to Judea where the crowds are, so that your followers can see your miracles?</verse>
				<verse number="4">No one can see what you’re doing here in the backwoods of Galilee. How do you expect to be successful and famous if you do all these things in secret? Now is your time—go to Jerusalem, come out of hiding, and show the world who you are!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">His brothers were pushing him, even though they didn’t yet believe in him as the Savior.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus responded, “My time of being unveiled hasn’t yet come, but any time is a suitable opportunity for you to gain man’s approval.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The world can’t hate you, but it does me, for I am exposing their evil deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You can go ahead and celebrate the feast without me—my appointed time has not yet come.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus lingered in Galilee until his brothers had left for the feast in Jerusalem. Then later, Jesus took a back road and went into Jerusalem in secret.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">During the feast, the Jewish leaders kept looking for Jesus and asking around, “Where is he? Have you seen him?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">A controversy was brewing among the people, with so many differing opinions about Jesus. Some were saying, “He’s a good man!” While others weren’t convinced and insisted, saying, “He’s just a demagogue.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yet no one was bold enough to speak out publicly on Jesus’ behalf for fear of the Jewish leaders.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Not until the feast was half over did Jesus finally appear in the temple courts and begin to teach.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The Jewish leaders were astonished by what he taught and said, “How did this man acquire such knowledge? He wasn’t trained in our schools—who taught him?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So Jesus responded, “I don’t teach my own ideas, but the truth revealed to me by the One who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If you want to test my teachings and discover where I received them, first be passionate to do God’s will, and then you will be able to discern if my teachings are from the heart of God or from my own opinions.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Charlatans praise themselves and seek honor from men, but my Father sent me to speak truth on his behalf. And I have no false motive, because I seek only the glory of God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Moses has given you the law, but not one of you is faithful to keep it. So if you are all law-breakers, why then would you seek to kill me?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then some in the crowd shouted out, “You must be out of your mind! Who’s trying to kill you?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus replied, “I only had to do one miracle, and all of you marvel!</verse>
				<verse number="22">Yet isn’t it true that Moses and your forefathers ordered you to circumcise your sons even if the eighth day fell on a Sabbath?</verse>
				<verse number="23">So if you cut away part of a man on the Sabbath and that doesn’t break the Jewish law, why then would you be indignant with me for making a man completely healed on the Sabbath?</verse>
				<verse number="24">Stop judging based on the superficial. First you must embrace the standards of mercy and truth.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then some of the residents of Jerusalem spoke up and said, “Isn’t this the one they’re trying to kill?</verse>
				<verse number="26">So why is he here speaking publicly and not one of the Jewish leaders is doing anything about it? Are they starting to think that he’s the Anointed One?</verse>
				<verse number="27">But how could he be, since we know this man is from Galilee, but no one will know where the true Messiah comes from, he’ll just appear out of nowhere.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Knowing all of this, Jesus one day preached boldly in the temple courts, “So, you think you know me and where I come from? But you don’t know the One who sent me—the Father who is always faithful. I have not come simply on my own initiative.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The Father has sent me here, and I know all about him, for I have come from his presence.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">His words caused many to want to arrest him, but no man was able to lay a hand on him, for it wasn’t yet his appointed time.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And there were many people who thought he might be the Messiah. They said, “After all, when the Anointed One appears, could he possibly do more signs and wonders than this man has done?”</verse>
				<verse number="32">So when the Pharisees heard these rumors circulating about Jesus, they went with the leading priests and the temple guards to arrest him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then Jesus said, “My days to be with you are numbered. Then I will return to the One who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="34">And you will search for me and not be able to find me. For where I am, you cannot come.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">When the Jewish leaders heard this, they discussed among themselves, “Where could he possibly go that we won’t be able to find him? Is he going to minister in a different land where our people live scattered among the nations? Is he going to teach those who are not Jews?</verse>
				<verse number="36">What did he really mean by his statement, ‘You will search for me and won’t be able to find me. And where I am you can’t come’?”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Then on the most important day of the feast, the last day, Jesus stood and shouted out to the crowds— “All you thirsty ones, come to me! Come to me and drink!</verse>
				<verse number="38">Believe in me so that rivers of living water will burst out from within you, flowing from your innermost being, just like the Scripture says!”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Jesus was prophesying about the Holy Spirit that believers were being prepared to receive. But the Holy Spirit had not yet been poured out upon them, because Jesus had not yet been unveiled in his full splendor.</verse>
				<verse number="40">When the crowd heard Jesus’ words, some said, “This man really is a prophet!”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Others said, “He’s the Messiah!” But others said, “How could he be the Anointed One since he’s from Galilee?</verse>
				<verse number="42">Don’t the Scriptures say that he will be one of David’s descendants and be born in Bethlehem, the city of David?”</verse>
				<verse number="43">So the crowd was divided over Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="44">some wanted him arrested but no one dared to lay a hand on him.</verse>
				<verse number="45">So when the temple guards returned to the Pharisees and the leading priests without Jesus, they were questioned, “Where is he? Why didn’t you bring that man back with you?”</verse>
				<verse number="46">They answered, “You don’t understand—he speaks amazing things like no one else has ever spoken!”</verse>
				<verse number="47">The religious leaders mocked, “Oh, so now you also have been led astray by him?</verse>
				<verse number="48">Do you see even one of us, your leaders, following him?</verse>
				<verse number="49">This ignorant rabble swarms around him because none of them know anything about the Law! They’re all cursed!”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Just then, Nicodemus, who had secretly spent time with Jesus, spoke up, for he was a respected voice among them.</verse>
				<verse number="51">He cautioned them, saying, “Does our law decide a man’s guilt before we first hear him and allow him to defend himself?”</verse>
				<verse number="52">They argued, “Oh, so now you’re an advocate for this Galilean! Search the Scriptures, Nicodemus, and you’ll see that there’s no mention of a prophet coming out of Galilee!” So with that their debate ended,</verse>
				<verse number="53">and they each went their own way.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Jesus walked up the Mount of Olives near the city where he spent the night.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then at dawn Jesus appeared in the temple courts again, and soon all the people gathered around to listen to his words, so he sat down and taught them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then in the middle of his teaching, the religious scholars and the Pharisees broke through the crowd and brought a woman who had been caught in the act of committing adultery and made her stand in the middle of everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then they said to Jesus, “Teacher, we caught this woman in the very act of adultery.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Doesn’t Moses’ law command us to stone to death a woman like this? Tell us, what do you say we should do with her?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">They were only testing Jesus because they hoped to trap him with his own words and accuse him of breaking the laws of Moses. But Jesus didn’t answer them. Instead he simply bent down and wrote in the dust with his finger.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Angry, they kept insisting that he answer their question, so Jesus stood up and looked at them and said, “Let’s have the man who has never had a sinful desire throw the first stone at her.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">And then he bent over again and wrote some more words in the dust.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Upon hearing that, her accusers slowly left the crowd one at a time, beginning with the oldest to the youngest, with a convicted conscience.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Until finally, Jesus was left alone with the woman still standing there in front of him. So he stood back up and said to her, “Dear woman, where are your accusers? Is there no one here to condemn you?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Looking around, she replied, “I see no one, Lord.” Jesus said, “Then I certainly don’t condemn you either. Go, and from now on, be free from a life of sin.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Jesus said, “I am light to the world, and those who embrace me will experience life-giving light, and they will never walk in darkness.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">The Pharisees were immediately offended and said, “You’re just boasting about yourself! Since we only have your word on this, it makes your testimony invalid!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Jesus responded, “Just because I am the one making these claims doesn’t mean they’re invalid. For I absolutely know who I am, where I’ve come from, and where I’m going. But you Pharisees have no idea about what I’m saying.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For you’ve set yourselves up as judges of others based on outward appearances, but I certainly never judge others in that way.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For I discern the truth. And I am not alone in my judgments, for my Father and I have the same understanding in all things, and he has sent me to you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Isn’t it written in the law of Moses that the testimony of two men is trustworthy?</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then what I say about who I am is true, for I am not alone in my testimony—my Father is the other witness, and we testify together of the truth.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then they asked, “Just who is this ‘Father’ of yours? Where is he?” Jesus answered, “You wouldn’t ask that question if you knew who I am, or my Father. For if you knew me, you would recognize my Father too.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">(Jesus taught all these things while standing in the treasure room of the temple. And no one dared to arrest him, for it wasn’t yet his time to surrender to men.)</verse>
				<verse number="21">One day Jesus said again, “I am about to leave you. You will want to find me, but you will still die in your sins. You won’t be able to come where I am going.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">This so confused the Jewish leaders that they began to say, “Is he planning to commit suicide? What’s he talking about—‘You won’t be able to come where I am going’?”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus spoke up and said, “You are all from the earth; I am from above. I am not from this world like you are.</verse>
				<verse number="24">That’s why I’ve told you that you will all die in your sins if you fail to believe that I AM who I AM.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">So they asked him plainly, “Who are you?” “I am the One I’ve always claimed to be.” Jesus replied.</verse>
				<verse number="26">“And I still have many more things to pronounce in judgment about you. For I will testify to the world of the truths that I have heard from my Father, and the Father who sent me is trustworthy.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">(Even after all of this, they still didn’t realize that he was speaking about his heavenly Father.)</verse>
				<verse number="28">“You will know me as ‘I AM’ after you have lifted me up from the earth as the Son of Man. Then you will realize that I do nothing on my own initiative, but I only speak the truth that the Father has revealed to me.</verse>
				<verse number="29">I am his messenger and he is always with me, for I only do that which delights his heart.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">These words caused many respected Jews to believe in him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him, “When you continue to embrace all that I teach, you prove that you are my true followers.</verse>
				<verse number="32">For if you embrace the truth, it will release true freedom into your lives.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Surprised by this, they said, “But we’re the descendants of Abraham and we’re already free. We’ve never been in bondage to anyone. How could you say that we will be released into more freedom?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">“I speak eternal truth,” Jesus said. “When you sin you are not free. You’ve become a slave in bondage to your sin.</verse>
				<verse number="35">And slaves have no permanent standing in a family, like a son does, for a son is a part of the family forever.</verse>
				<verse number="36">So if the Son sets you free from sin, then become a true son and be unquestionably free!</verse>
				<verse number="37">Even though you are descendants of Abraham, you desire to kill me because the message I bring has not found a home in your hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Yet the truths I speak I’ve seen and received in my Father’s presence. But you are doing what you’ve learned from your father!”</verse>
				<verse number="39">“What do you mean?” they replied. “Abraham is our father!” Jesus said, “If you are really Abraham’s sons, then you would follow in the steps of Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="40">I’ve only told you the truth that I’ve heard in my Father’s presence, but now you are wanting me dead—is that how Abraham acted?</verse>
				<verse number="41">No, you people are doing what your father has taught you!” Indignant, they responded, “What are you talking about? We only have one Father, God himself! We’re not illegitimate!”</verse>
				<verse number="42">Jesus said, “Then if God were really your father, you would love me, for I’ve come from his presence. I didn’t come here on my own, but God sent me to you.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Why don’t you understand what I say? You don’t understand because your hearts are closed to my message!</verse>
				<verse number="44">“You are the offspring of your father, the devil, and you serve your father very well, passionately carrying out his desires. He’s been a murderer right from the start! He never stood with the truth, for he’s full of nothing but lies—lying is his native tongue. He is a master of deception and the father of lies!</verse>
				<verse number="45">But I am the true Prince who speaks nothing but the truth, yet you refuse to believe and you want nothing to do with me.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Can you name one sin that I’ve committed? Then if I am telling you only the truth, why don’t you believe me?</verse>
				<verse number="47">If you really knew God, you would listen, receive, and respond with faith to his words. But since you don’t listen and respond to what he says, it proves you don’t belong to him and you have no room for him in your hearts.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">“See! We were right all along!” some of the Jewish leaders shouted. “You’re nothing but a demon-possessed Samaritan!”</verse>
				<verse number="49">Jesus replied, “It is not a demon that would cause me to honor my Father. I live my life for his honor, even though you insult me for it.</verse>
				<verse number="50">I never have a need to seek my own glory, for the Father will do that for me, and he will judge those who do not.</verse>
				<verse number="51">I speak to you this eternal truth: whoever cherishes my words and keeps them will never experience death.”</verse>
				<verse number="52">This prompted the Jewish leaders to say, “Now we know for sure that you’re demon possessed! You just said that those who keep watch over your words will never experience death, but Abraham and all the prophets have died!</verse>
				<verse number="53">Do you think you’re greater than our father Abraham and all the prophets? You are so delusional about yourself that you make yourself greater than you are!”</verse>
				<verse number="54">Jesus answered them, “If I were to tell you how great I am, it would mean nothing. But my Father is the One who will prove it and will glorify me. Isn’t he the One you claim is your God?</verse>
				<verse number="55">But in reality, you’ve never embraced him as your own. I know him, and I would be a liar, like yourselves, if I told you anything less than that. I have fully embraced him, and I treasure his every word.</verse>
				<verse number="56">And not only that, Abraham, your ancestor, was overjoyed when he received the revelation of my coming to earth. Yes, he foresaw me coming and was filled with delight!”</verse>
				<verse number="57">But many of the Jewish leaders doubted him and said, “What are you talking about? You’re not even fifty years old yet. You talk like you’ve seen Abraham!”</verse>
				<verse number="58">Jesus said to them, “I give you this eternal truth: I have existed long before Abraham was born, for I AM!”</verse>
				<verse number="59">When they heard this, they picked up rocks to stone him, but Jesus concealed himself as he passed through the crowd and went away from there.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Afterward, as Jesus walked down the street, he noticed a man blind from birth.</verse>
				<verse number="2">His disciples asked him, “Teacher, whose sin caused this guy’s blindness, his own, or the sin of his parents?”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus answered, “Neither. It happened to him so that you could watch him experience God’s miracle.</verse>
				<verse number="4">While I am with you, it is daytime and we must do the works of God who sent me while the light shines. For there is coming a dark night when no one will be able to work.</verse>
				<verse number="5">As long as I am with you my life is the light that pierces the world’s darkness.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then Jesus spat on the ground and made some clay with his saliva. Then he anointed the blind man’s eyes with the clay.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And he said to the blind man, “Now go and wash the clay from your eyes in the ritual pool of Siloam.” So he went and washed his face and as he came back, he could see for the first time in his life!</verse>
				<verse number="8">This caused quite a stir among the people of the neighborhood, for they noticed the blind beggar was now seeing! They began to say to one another, “Isn’t this the blind man who once sat and begged?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Some said, “No, it can’t be him!” Others said, “But it looks just like him—it has to be him!” All the while the man kept insisting, “I’m the man who was blind!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Finally, they asked him, “What has happened to you?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">He replied, “I met the man named Jesus! He rubbed clay on my eyes and said, ‘Go to the pool named Siloam and wash.’ So I went and while I was washing the clay from my eyes I began to see for the very first time ever!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">So the people of the neighborhood inquired, “Where is this man?” “I have no idea.” the man replied.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So the people marched him over to the Pharisees to speak with them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They were concerned because the miracle Jesus performed by making clay with his saliva and anointing the man’s eyes happened on a Sabbath day, a day that no one was allowed to “work.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the Pharisees asked the man, “How did you have your sight restored?” He replied, “A man anointed my eyes with clay, then I washed, and now I can see for the first time in my life!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then an argument broke out among the Pharisees over the healing of the blind man on the Sabbath. Some said, “This man who performed this healing is clearly not from God! He doesn’t even observe the Sabbath!” Others said, “If Jesus is just an ordinary sinner, how could he perform a miracle like that?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">This prompted them to turn on the man healed of blindness, putting him on the spot in front of them all, demanding an answer. They asked, “Who do you say he is—this man who opened your blind eyes?” “He’s a prophet of God!” the man replied.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Still refusing to believe that the man had been healed and was truly blind from birth, the Jewish leaders called for the man’s parents to be brought to them.</verse>
				<verse number="19">So they asked his parents, “Is this your son?” “Yes,” they answered. “Was he really born blind?” “Yes, he was,” they replied. So they pressed his parents to answer, “Then how is it that he’s now seeing?”</verse>
				<verse number="20"></verse>
				<verse number="21">“We have no idea,” they answered. “We don’t know what happened to our son. Ask him, he’s a mature adult. He can speak for himself.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">(Now the parents were obviously intimidated by the Jewish religious leaders, for they had already announced to the people that if anyone publicly confessed Jesus as the Messiah, they would be excommunicated.</verse>
				<verse number="23">That’s why they told them, “Ask him, he’s a mature adult. He can speak for himself.”)</verse>
				<verse number="24">So once again they summoned the man who was healed of blindness and said to him, “Swear to God to tell us the truth! We know the man who healed you is a sinful man! Do you agree?”</verse>
				<verse number="25">The healed man replied, “I have no idea what kind of man he is. All I know is that I was blind and now I can see for the first time in my life!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">“But what did he do to you?” they asked. “How did he heal you?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">The man responded, “I told you once and you didn’t listen to me. Why do you make me repeat it? Are you wanting to be his followers too?”</verse>
				<verse number="28">This angered the Jewish leaders. They heaped insults on him, “We can tell you are one of his followers—now we know it! We are true followers of Moses,</verse>
				<verse number="29">for we know that God spoke to Moses directly. But as for this one, we don’t know where he’s coming from!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">“Well, what a surprise this is!” the man said. “You don’t even know where he comes from, but he healed my eyes and now I can see!</verse>
				<verse number="31">We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but only to godly people who do his will.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Yet who has ever heard of a man born blind that was healed and given his eyesight for the very first time?</verse>
				<verse number="33">I tell you, if this man isn’t from God, he wouldn’t be able to heal me like he has!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Some of the Jewish leaders were enraged and said, “Just who do you think you are to lecture us! You were born a blind, filthy sinner!” So they threw the man out in the street.</verse>
				<verse number="35">When Jesus learned they had thrown him out, he went to find him and said to him, “Do you believe in the Son of God?”</verse>
				<verse number="36">The man whose blind eyes were healed answered, “Who is he, Master? Tell me so that I can place all my faith in him.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Jesus replied, “You’re looking right at him. He’s speaking with you. It’s me, the one in front of you now.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then the man threw himself at his feet and worshiped Jesus and said, “Lord, I believe in you!”</verse>
				<verse number="39">And Jesus said, “I have come to judge those who think they see and make them blind. And for those who are blind, I have come to make them see.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Some of the Pharisees were standing nearby and overheard these words. They interrupted Jesus and said, “You mean to tell us that we are blind?”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Jesus told them, “If you would acknowledge your blindness, then your sin would be removed. But now that you claim to see, your sin remains with you!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Jesus said to the Pharisees, “Listen to this eternal truth: The person who sneaks over the wall to enter into the sheep pen, rather than coming through the gate, reveals himself as a thief coming to steal.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But the true Shepherd walks right up to the gate,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and because the gatekeeper knows who he is, he opens the gate to let him in. And the sheep recognize the voice of the true Shepherd, for he calls his own by name and leads them out, for they belong to him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And when he has brought out all his sheep, he walks ahead of them and they will follow him, for they are familiar with his voice.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But they will run away from strangers and never follow them because they know it’s the voice of a stranger.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus told the Pharisees this parable even though they didn’t understand a word of what he meant.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So Jesus went over it again, “I speak to you eternal truth: I am the Gate for the flock.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All those who broke in before me are thieves who came to steal, but the sheep never listened to them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I am the Gateway. To enter through me is to experience life, freedom, and satisfaction.</verse>
				<verse number="10">A thief has only one thing in mind—he wants to steal, slaughter, and destroy. But I have come to give you everything in abundance, more than you expect —life in its fullness until you overflow!</verse>
				<verse number="11">I am the Good Shepherd who lays down my life as a sacrifice for the sheep.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But the worker who serves only for wages is not a real shepherd. Because he has no heart for the sheep he will run away and abandon them when he sees the wolf coming. And then the wolf mauls the sheep, drags them off, and scatters them.</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">“I alone am the Good Shepherd, and I know those whose hearts are mine, for they recognize me and know me,</verse>
				<verse number="15">just as my Father knows my heart and I know my Father’s heart. I am ready to give my life for the sheep.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“And I have other sheep that I will gather which are not of this Jewish flock. And I, their shepherd, must lead them too, and they will follow me and listen to my voice. And I will join them all into one flock with one shepherd.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“The Father has an intense love for me because I freely give my own life—to raise it up again.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I surrender my own life, and no one has the power to take my life from me. I have the authority to lay it down and the power to take it back again. This is the destiny my Father has set before me.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">This teaching set off another heated controversy among the Jewish leaders.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Many of them said, “This man is a demon-possessed lunatic! Why would anyone listen to a word he says?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">But then there were others who weren’t so sure: “His teaching is full of insight. These are not the ravings of a madman! How could a demonized man give sight to one born blind?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">The time came to observe the winter Feast of Renewal in Jerusalem. Jesus walked into the temple area under Solomon’s covered walkway</verse>
				<verse number="23"></verse>
				<verse number="24">when the Jewish leaders encircled him and said, “How much longer will you keep us in suspense? Tell us the truth and clarify this for us once and for all. Are you really the Messiah, the Anointed One?”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus answered them, “I have told you the truth already and you did not believe me. The proof of who I am is revealed by all the miracles that I do in the name of my Father.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Yet, you stubbornly refuse to follow me, because you are not my sheep. As I’ve told you before:</verse>
				<verse number="27">My own sheep will hear my voice and I know each one, and they will follow me.</verse>
				<verse number="28">I give to them the gift of eternal life and they will never be lost and no one has the power to snatch them out of my hands.</verse>
				<verse number="29">My Father, who has given them to me as his gift, is the mightiest of all, and no one has the power to snatch them from my Father’s care.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The Father and I are one.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">When they heard this, the Jewish leaders were so enraged that they picked up rocks to stone him to death.</verse>
				<verse number="32">But Jesus said, “My Father has empowered me to work many miracles and acts of mercy among you. So which one of them do you want to stone me for?”</verse>
				<verse number="33">The Jewish leaders responded, “We’re not stoning you for anything good you did—it’s because of your blasphemy! You’re just a son of Adam, but you’ve claimed to be God!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus answered, “Isn’t it written in your Scriptures that God said, ‘You are gods?’ The Scriptures cannot be denied or found to be in error.</verse>
				<verse number="35">So if those who have the message of the Scriptures are said to be ‘gods,’ then why would you accuse me of blasphemy?</verse>
				<verse number="36">For I have been uniquely chosen by God and he is the one who sent me to you. How then could it be blasphemy for me to say, ‘I am the Son of God!’</verse>
				<verse number="37">If I’m not doing the beautiful works that my Father sent me to do, then don’t believe me.</verse>
				<verse number="38">But if you see me doing the beautiful works of God upon the earth, then you should at least believe the evidence of the miracles, even if you don’t believe my words! Then you would come to experience me and be convinced that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Once again they attempted to seize him, but he escaped miraculously from their clutches.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Then Jesus went back to the place where John had baptized him at the crossing of the Jordan.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Many came out to where he was and said about him, “Even though John didn’t perform any miracles, everything he predicted about this man is true!”</verse>
				<verse number="42">And many people became followers of Jesus at the Jordan and believed in him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">In the village of Bethany there was a man named Lazarus, and his sisters, Mary and Martha. Mary was the one who would anoint Jesus’ feet with costly perfume and dry his feet with her long hair. One day Lazarus became very sick to the point of death.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">So his sisters sent a message to Jesus, “Lord, our brother Lazarus, the one you love, is very sick. Please come!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">When he heard this, he said, “This sickness will not end in death for Lazarus, but will bring glory and praise to God. This will reveal the greatness of the Son of God by what takes place.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now even though Jesus loved Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, he remained where he was for two more days.</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">Finally, on the third day, he said to his disciples, “Come. It’s time to go to Bethany.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">“But Teacher,” they said to him, “do you really want to go back there? It was just a short time ago the people of Judea were going to stone you!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus replied, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight in every day? You can go through a day without the fear of stumbling when you walk in the One who gives light to the world. But you will stumble when the light is not in you, for you’ll be walking in the dark.”</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">Then Jesus added, “Lazarus, our friend, has just fallen asleep. It’s time that I go and awaken him.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">When they heard this, the disciples replied, “Lord, if he has just fallen asleep, then he’ll get better.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Jesus was speaking about Lazarus’ death, but the disciples presumed he was talking about natural sleep.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Jesus made it plain to them, “Lazarus is dead.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And for your sake, I’m glad I wasn’t there, because now you have another opportunity to see who I am so that you will learn to trust in me. Come, let’s go and see him.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So Thomas, nicknamed the Twin, remarked to the other disciples, “Let’s go so that we can die with him.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now when they arrived at Bethany, which was only about two miles from Jerusalem, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.</verse>
				<verse number="18"></verse>
				<verse number="19">Many friends of Mary and Martha had come from the region to console them over the loss of their brother.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And when Martha heard that Jesus was approaching the village, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed in the house.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Martha said to Jesus, “My Lord, if only you had come sooner, my brother wouldn’t have died.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But I know that if you were to ask God for anything, he would do it for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus told her, “Your brother will rise and live.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">She replied, “Yes, I know he will rise with everyone else on resurrection day.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Martha,” Jesus said, “ You don’t have to wait until then. I am the Resurrection, and I am Life Eternal. Anyone who clings to me in faith, even though he dies, will live forever.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And the one who lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then Martha replied, “Yes, Lord, I do! I’ve always believed that you are the Anointed One, the Son of God who has come into the world for us!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then she left and hurried off to her sister, Mary, and called her aside from all the mourners and whispered to her, “The Master is here and he’s asking for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">So when Mary heard this, she quickly went off to find him,</verse>
				<verse number="30">for Jesus was lingering outside the village at the same spot where Martha met him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Now when Mary’s friends who were comforting her noticed how quickly she ran out of the house, they followed her, assuming she was going to the tomb of her brother to mourn.</verse>
				<verse number="32">When Mary finally found Jesus outside the village, she fell at his feet in tears and said, “Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">When Jesus looked at Mary and saw her weeping at his feet, and all her friends who were with her grieving, he shuddered with emotion and was deeply moved with tenderness and compassion.</verse>
				<verse number="34">He said to them, “Where did you bury him?” “Lord, come with us and we’ll show you,” they replied.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then tears streamed down Jesus’ face.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Seeing Jesus weep caused many of the mourners to say, “Look how much he loved Lazarus.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Yet others said, “Isn’t this the One who opens blind eyes? Why didn’t he do something to keep Lazarus from dying?”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then Jesus, with intense emotions, came to the tomb—a cave with a stone placed over its entrance.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Jesus told them, “Roll away the stone.” Then Martha said, “But Lord, it’s been four days since he died—by now his body is already decomposing!”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Jesus looked at her and said, “Didn’t I tell you that if you will believe in me, you will see God unveil his power?”</verse>
				<verse number="41">So they rolled away the heavy stone. Jesus gazed into heaven and said, “Father, thank you that you have heard my prayer,</verse>
				<verse number="42">for you listen to every word I speak. Now, so that these who stand here with me will believe that you have sent me to the earth as your messenger, I will use the power you have given me. ”</verse>
				<verse number="43">Then with a loud voice Jesus shouted with authority: “Lazarus! Come out of the tomb!”</verse>
				<verse number="44">Then in front of everyone, Lazarus, who had died four days earlier, slowly hobbled out—he still had grave clothes tightly wrapped around his hands and feet and covering his face! Jesus said to them, “Unwrap him and let him loose.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">From that day forward many of those who had come to visit Mary believed in him, for they had seen with their own eyes this amazing miracle!</verse>
				<verse number="46">But a few went back to inform the Pharisees about what Jesus had done.</verse>
				<verse number="47">So the Pharisees and the chief priests called a special meeting of the High Council and said, “So what are we going to do about this man? Look at all the great miracles he’s performing!</verse>
				<verse number="48">If we allow him to continue like this, everyone will believe in him. And the Romans will take action and destroy both our country and our people!”</verse>
				<verse number="49">Now Caiaphas, the high priest that year, spoke up and said, “You don’t understand a thing!</verse>
				<verse number="50">Don’t you realize we’d be much better off if this one man were to die for the people than for the whole nation to perish?”</verse>
				<verse number="51">(This prophecy that Jesus was destined to die for the Jewish people didn’t come from Caiaphas himself, but he was moved by God to prophesy as the chief priest.</verse>
				<verse number="52">And Jesus’ death would not be for the Jewish people only, but to gather together God’s children scattered around the world and unite them as one.)</verse>
				<verse number="53">So from that day on, they were committed to killing Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="54">For this reason Jesus no longer went out in public among the Jews. But he went in the wilderness to a village called Ephraim, where he secluded himself with his disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="55">Now the time came for the Passover preparations, and many from the countryside went to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the feast began.</verse>
				<verse number="56">And all the people kept looking out for Jesus, expecting him to come to the city. They said to themselves while they waited in the temple courts, “Do you think that he will dare come to the feast?”</verse>
				<verse number="57">For the leading priests and the Pharisees had given orders that they be informed immediately if anyone saw Jesus, so they could seize and arrest him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Six days before the Passover began, Jesus went back to Bethany, the town where he raised Lazarus from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They had prepared a supper for Jesus. Martha served, and Lazarus and Mary were among those at the table.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Mary picked up an alabaster jar filled with nearly a liter of extremely rare and costly perfume—the purest extract of nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet. Then she wiped them dry with her long hair. And the fragrance of the costly oil filled the house.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But Judas the locksmith, Simon’s son, the betrayer, spoke up and said,</verse>
				<verse number="5">“What a waste! We could have sold this perfume for a fortune and given the money to the poor!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">(In fact, Judas had no heart for the poor. He only said this because he was a thief and in charge of the money case. He would steal money whenever he wanted from the funds given to support Jesus’ ministry.)</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jesus said to Judas, “Leave her alone! She has saved it for the time of my burial.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You’ll always have the poor with you; but you won’t always have me.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">When the word got out that Jesus was not far from Jerusalem, a large crowd came out to see him, and they also wanted to see Lazarus, the man Jesus had raised from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="10">This prompted the chief priests to seal their plans to do away with both Jesus and Lazarus,</verse>
				<verse number="11">for his miracle testimony was irrefutable and was persuading many of the Jews living in Jerusalem to believe in Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The next day the news that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem swept through the massive crowd gathered for the feast.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So they took palm branches and went out to meet him. Everyone was shouting, “Lord, be our Savior! Blessed is the one who comes to us sent from Yahweh, the King of Israel!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it to fulfill what was prophesied:</verse>
				<verse number="15">“People of Zion, have no fear! Look—it’s your king coming to you riding on a young donkey!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now Jesus’ disciples didn’t fully understand the importance of what was taking place, but after he was raised and exalted into glory, they understood how Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies in the Scriptures that were written about him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">All the eyewitnesses of the miracle Jesus performed when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead kept spreading the news about Jesus to everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The news of this miracle of resurrection caused the crowds to swell as great numbers of people welcomed him into the city with joy.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But the Pharisees were disturbed by this and said to each other, “We won’t be able to stop this. The whole world is going to run after him!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now there were a number of foreigners from among the nations who were worshipers at the feast.</verse>
				<verse number="21">They went to Philip (who came from the village of Bethsaida in Galilee) and they asked him, “Would you take us to see Jesus? We want to see him.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">So Philip went to find Andrew, and then they both went to inform Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He replied to them, “Now is the time for the Son of Man to be glorified.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Let me make this clear: A single grain of wheat will never be more than a single grain of wheat unless it drops into the ground and dies. Because then it sprouts and produces a great harvest of wheat—all because one grain died.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“The person who loves his life and pampers himself will miss true life! But the one who detaches his life from this world and abandons himself to me, will find true life and enjoy it forever!</verse>
				<verse number="26">If you want to be my disciple, follow me and you will go where I am going. And if you truly follow me as my disciple, the Father will shower his favor upon your life.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Even though I am torn within, and my soul is in turmoil, I will not ask the Father to rescue me from this hour of trial. For I have come to fulfill my purpose — to offer myself to God.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So, Father, bring glory to your name!” Then suddenly a booming voice was heard from the sky, “I have glorified my name! And I will glorify it through you again!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">The audible voice of God startled the crowd standing nearby. Some thought it was only thunder, yet others said, “An angel just spoke to him!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then Jesus told them, “The voice you heard was not for my benefit, but for yours— to help you believe.</verse>
				<verse number="31">From this moment on, everything in this world is about to change, for the ruler of this dark world will be overthrown.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And I will do this when I am lifted up off the ground and when I draw the hearts of people to gather them to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">He said this to indicate that he would die by being lifted up on the cross.</verse>
				<verse number="34">People from the crowd spoke up and said, “Die? How could the Anointed One die? The Word of God says that the Anointed One will live with us forever, but you just said that the Son of Man must be lifted up from the earth. And who is this Son of Man anyway?”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Jesus replied, “You will have the light shining with you for only a little while longer. While you still have me, walk in the light, so that the darkness doesn’t overtake you. For when you walk in the dark you have no idea where you’re going.</verse>
				<verse number="36">So believe and cling to the light while I am with you, so that you will become children of light.” After saying this, Jesus then entered into the crowd and hid himself from them.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Even with the overwhelming evidence of all the many signs and wonders that Jesus had performed in front of them, his critics still refused to believe.</verse>
				<verse number="38">This fulfilled the prophecy given by Isaiah: Lord, who has believed our message? Who has seen the unveiling of your great power?</verse>
				<verse number="39">And the people were not able to believe, for Isaiah also prophesied:</verse>
				<verse number="40">God has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts to the truth. So with their eyes and hearts closed they cannot understand the truth nor turn to me so that I could instantly cleanse and heal them.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Isaiah said these things because he had seen and experienced the splendor of Jesus and prophesied about him.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Yet there were many Jewish leaders who believed in Jesus, but because they feared the Pharisees they kept it secret, so they wouldn’t be ostracized by the assembly of the Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="43">For they loved the glory that men could give them rather than the glory that came from God!</verse>
				<verse number="44">Jesus shouted out passionately, “To believe in me is to also believe in God who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="45">For when you look at me you are seeing the One who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="46">I have come as a light to shine in this dark world so that all who trust in me will no longer wander in darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="47">If you hear my words and refuse to follow them, I do not judge you. For I have not come to judge you but to save you.</verse>
				<verse number="48">If you reject me and refuse to follow my words, you already have a judge. The message of truth I have given you will rise up to judge you at the Day of Judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="49">For I’m not speaking as someone who is self-appointed, but I speak by the authority of the Father himself who sent me, and who instructed me what to say.</verse>
				<verse number="50">And I know that the Father’s commands result in eternal life, and that’s why I speak the very words I’ve heard him speak.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Jesus knew that the night before Passover would be his last night on earth before leaving this world to return to the Father’s side. All throughout his time with his disciples, Jesus had demonstrated a deep and tender love for them. And now he longed to show them the full measure of his love.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Before their evening meal had begun, the accuser had already deeply embedded betrayal into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now Jesus was fully aware that the Father had placed all things under his control, for he had come from God and was about to go back to be with him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So he got up from the meal and took off his outer robe, and took a towel and wrapped it around his waist.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ dirty feet and dry them with his towel.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But when Jesus got to Simon Peter, he objected and said, “I can’t let you wash my dirty feet—you’re my Lord!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jesus replied, “You don’t understand yet the meaning of what I’m doing, but soon it will be clear to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Peter looked at Jesus and said, “You’ll never wash my dirty feet—never!” “But Peter, if you don’t allow me to wash your feet,” Jesus responded, “then you will not be able to share life with me.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">So Peter said, “Lord, in that case, don’t just wash my feet, wash my hands and my head too!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus said to him, “You are already clean. You’ve been washed completely and you just need your feet to be cleansed—but that can’t be said of all of you.” For Jesus knew which one was about to betray him,</verse>
				<verse number="11">and that’s why he told them that not all of them were clean.</verse>
				<verse number="12">After washing their feet, he put his robe on and returned to his place at the table. “Do you understand what I just did?” Jesus said.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“You’ve called me your teacher and lord, and you’re right, for that’s who I am.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So if I’m your teacher and lord and have just washed your dirty feet, then you should follow the example that I’ve set for you and wash one another’s dirty feet. Now do for each other what I have just done for you.</verse>
				<verse number="15"></verse>
				<verse number="16">I speak to you timeless truth: a servant is not superior to his master, and an apostle is never greater than the one who sent him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So now put into practice what I have done for you, and you will experience a life of happiness enriched with untold blessings!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">“I don’t refer to all of you when I tell you these things, for I know the ones I’ve chosen—to fulfill the Scripture that says, ‘The one who shared supper with me treacherously betrays me.’</verse>
				<verse number="19">I am telling you this now, before it happens, so that when the prophecy comes to pass you will be convinced that I AM.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Listen to this timeless truth: whoever receives the messenger I send receives me, and the one who receives me receives the Father who sent me.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then Jesus was moved deeply in his spirit. Looking at his disciples, he announced, “I tell you the truth—one of you is about to betray me.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Eyeing each other, his disciples puzzled over which one of them could do such a thing.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The disciple that Jesus dearly loved was at the right of him at the table and was leaning his head on Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Peter gestured to this disciple to ask Jesus who it was he was referring to.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then the dearly loved disciple leaned into Jesus’ chest and whispered, “Master, who is it?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">“The one I give this piece of bread to after I’ve dipped it in the bowl,” Jesus replied. Then he dipped the piece of bread into the bowl and handed it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</verse>
				<verse number="27">And when Judas ate the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus looked at Judas and said, “What you are planning to do, go do it now.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">None of those around the table realized what was happening.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Some thought that Judas, their trusted treasurer, was being told to go buy what was needed for the Passover celebration, or perhaps to go give something to the poor.</verse>
				<verse number="30">So Judas left quickly and went out into the dark night to betray Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="31">After Judas left the room, Jesus said, “The time has come for the glory of God to surround the Son of Man, and God will be greatly glorified through what happens to me.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And very soon God will unveil the glory of the Son of Man.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“My dear friends, I only have a brief time left to be with you. And then you will search and long for me. But I tell you what I told the Jewish leaders: you’ll not be able to come where I am.</verse>
				<verse number="34">“So I give you now a new commandment: Love each other just as much as I have loved you.</verse>
				<verse number="35">For when you demonstrate the same love I have for you by loving one another, everyone will know that you’re my true followers.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Peter interjected, “But, Master, where are you going?” Jesus replied, “Where I am going you won’t be able to follow, but one day you will follow me there.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Peter said, “What do you mean I’m not able to follow you now? I would sacrifice my life to die for you!”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Jesus answered, “Would you really lay down your life for me, Peter? Here’s the absolute truth: Before the rooster crows in the morning, you will say three times that you don’t even know me!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">“Don’t worry or surrender to your fear. For you’ve believed in God, now trust and believe in me also.</verse>
				<verse number="2">My Father’s house has many dwelling places. If it were otherwise, I would tell you plainly, because I go to prepare a place for you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And when everything is ready, I will come back and take you to myself so that you will be where I am.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And you already know the way to the place where I’m going.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Thomas said to him, “Master, we don’t know where you’re going, so how could we know the way there?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus explained, “I am the Way, I am the Truth, and I am the Life. No one comes next to the Father except through union with me. To know me is to know my Father too.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And from now on you will realize that you have seen him and experienced him.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Philip spoke up, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be all that we need!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus replied, “Philip, I’ve been with you all this time and you still don’t know who I am? How could you ask me to show you the Father, for anyone who has looked at me has seen the Father.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Don’t you believe that the Father is living in me and that I am living in the Father? Even my words are not my own but come from my Father, for he lives in me and performs his miracles of power through me.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Believe that I live as one with my Father and that my Father lives as one with me—or at least, believe because of the mighty miracles I have done.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“I tell you this timeless truth: The person who follows me in faith, believing in me, will do the same mighty miracles that I do—even greater miracles than these because I go to be with my Father!</verse>
				<verse number="13">For I will do whatever you ask me to do when you ask me in my name. And that is how the Son will show what the Father is really like and bring glory to him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Ask me anything in my name, and I will do it for you!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Loving me empowers you to obey my commands.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And I will ask the Father and he will give you another Savior, the Holy Spirit of Truth, who will be to you a friend just like me—and he will never leave you. The world won’t receive him because they can’t see him or know him. But you know him intimately because he remains with you and will live inside you.</verse>
				<verse number="17"></verse>
				<verse number="18">“I promise that I will never leave you helpless or abandon you as orphans—I will come back to you!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Soon I will leave this world and they will see me no longer, but you will see me, because I will live again, and you will come alive too.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So when that day comes, you will know that I am living in the Father and that you are one with me, for I will be living in you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Those who truly love me are those who obey my commands. Whoever passionately loves me will be passionately loved by my Father. And I will passionately love him in return and will reveal myself to him.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then one of the disciples named Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “Lord, why is it you will only reveal your identity to us and not to everyone?”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus replied, “Loving me empowers you to obey my word. And my Father will love you so deeply that we will come to you and make you our dwelling place.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But those who don’t love me will not obey my words. The Father did not send me to speak my own revelation, but the words of my Father.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I am telling you this while I am still with you.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But when the Father sends the Spirit of Holiness, the One like me who sets you free, he will teach you all things in my name. And he will inspire you to remember every word that I’ve told you.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“I leave the gift of peace with you—my peace. Not the kind of fragile peace given by the world, but my perfect peace. Don’t yield to fear or be troubled in your hearts—instead, be courageous!</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Remember what I’ve told you, that I must go away, but I promise to come back to you. So if you truly love me, you will be glad for me, since I’m returning to my Father, who is greater than I.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So when all of these things happen, you will still trust and cling to me.</verse>
				<verse number="30">I won’t speak with you much longer, for the ruler of this dark world is coming. But he has no power over me, for he has nothing to use against me.</verse>
				<verse number="31">I am doing exactly what the Father destined for me to accomplish, so that the world will discover how much I love my Father. Now come with me.”</verse>

			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">“I am a true sprouting vine, and the farmer who tends the vine is my Father.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He cares for the branches connected to me by lifting and propping up the fruitless branches and pruning every fruitful branch to yield a greater harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The words I have spoken over you have already cleansed you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So you must remain in life-union with me, for I remain in life-union with you. For as a branch severed from the vine will not bear fruit, so your life will be fruitless unless you live your life intimately joined to mine.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“I am the sprouting vine and you’re my branches. As you live in union with me as your source, fruitfulness will stream from within you—but when you live separated from me you are powerless.</verse>
				<verse number="6">If a person is separated from me, he is discarded; such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire to be burned.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But if you live in life-union with me and if my words live powerfully within you—then you can ask whatever you desire and it will be done.</verse>
				<verse number="8">When your lives bear abundant fruit, you demonstrate that you are my mature disciples who glorify my Father!</verse>
				<verse number="9">“I love each of you with the same love that the Father loves me. You must continually let my love nourish your hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="10">If you keep my commands, you will live in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commands, for I continually live nourished and empowered by his love.</verse>
				<verse number="11">My purpose for telling you these things is so that the joy that I experience will fill your hearts with overflowing gladness!</verse>
				<verse number="12">“So this is my command: Love each other deeply, as much as I have loved you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For the greatest love of all is a love that sacrifices all. And this great love is demonstrated when a person sacrifices his life for his friends.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“You show that you are my intimate friends when you obey all that I command you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I have never called you ‘servants,’ because a master doesn’t confide in his servants, and servants don’t always understand what the master is doing. But I call you my most intimate and cherished friends, for I reveal to you everything that I’ve heard from my Father.</verse>
				<verse number="16">You didn’t choose me, but I’ve chosen and commissioned you to go into the world to bear fruit. And your fruit will last, because whatever you ask of my Father, for my sake, he will give it to you!</verse>
				<verse number="17">So this is my parting command: Love one another deeply!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Just remember, when the unbelieving world hates you, they first hated me.</verse>
				<verse number="19">If you were to give your allegiance to the world, they would love and welcome you as one of their own. But because you won’t align yourself with the values of this world, they will hate you. I have chosen you and taken you out of the world to be mine.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So remember what I taught you, that a servant isn’t superior to his master. And since they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. And if they obey my teachings, they will also obey yours.</verse>
				<verse number="21">They will treat you this way because you are mine, and they don’t know the One who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“If I had not come and spoken these things to the unbelieving world, they would not feel the guilt of their sin, but now their sin is left uncovered.</verse>
				<verse number="23">If anyone hates me, they hate my Father also.</verse>
				<verse number="24">If I had not performed miracles in their presence like no one else has done, they would not feel the guilt of their sins. But now, they have seen and hated both me and my Father.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And all of this has happened to fulfill what is written in their Scriptures: They hated me for no reason.</verse>
				<verse number="26">“And I will send you the Divine Encourager from the very presence of my Father. He will come to you, the Spirit of Truth, emanating from the Father, and he will speak to you about me.</verse>
				<verse number="27">And you will tell everyone the truth about me, for you have walked with me from the start.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">“I have told you this so that you would not surrender to confusion or doubt.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For you will be excommunicated from the synagogues, and a time is coming when you will be put to death by misguided ones who will presume to be doing God a great service by putting you to death.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And they will do these things because they don’t know anything about the Father or me.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I’m telling you this now so that when their time comes you will remember that I foretold it. I didn’t tell you this in the beginning because I was still with you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But now that I’m about to leave you and go back to join the One who sent me, you need to be told. Yet, not one of you are asking me where I’m going.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Instead your hearts are filled with sadness because I’ve told you these things.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But here’s the truth: It’s to your advantage that I go away, for if I don’t go away the Divine Encourager will not be released to you. But after I depart, I will send him to you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And when he comes, he will expose sin and prove that the world is wrong about God’s righteousness and his judgments.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“ ‘Sin,’ because they refuse to believe in who I am.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“God’s ‘righteousness,’ because I’m going back to join the Father and you’ll see me no longer.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“And ‘judgment’ because the ruler of this dark world has already received his sentence.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“There is so much more I would like to say to you, but it’s more than you can grasp at this moment.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But when the truth-giving Spirit comes, he will unveil the reality of every truth within you. He won’t speak on his own, but only what he hears from the Father, and he will reveal prophetically to you what is to come.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He will glorify me on the earth, for he will receive from me what is mine and reveal it to you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Everything that belongs to the Father belongs to me—that’s why I say that the Divine Encourager will receive what is mine and reveal it to you.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Soon you won’t see me any longer, but then, after a little while, you will see me in a new way.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Some of the disciples asked each other, “What does he mean, ‘Soon you won’t see me,’ and, ‘A little while after that and you will see me in a new way’? And what does he mean, ‘Because I’m going to my Father’?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">So they kept on repeating, “What’s the meaning of ‘a little while’? We have no clue what he’s talking about!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus knew what they were thinking, and it was obvious that they were anxious to ask him what he had meant, so he spoke up and said,</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Let me make it quite clear: You will weep and be overcome with grief over what happens to me. The unbelieving world will be happy, while you will be filled with sorrow. But know this, your sadness will turn into joy when you see me again!</verse>
				<verse number="21">Just like a woman giving birth experiences intense labor pains in delivering her baby, yet after the child is born she quickly forgets what she went through because of the overwhelming joy of knowing that a new baby has been born into the world.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“So will you also pass through a time of intense sorrow when I am taken from you, but you will see me again! And then your hearts will burst with joy, with no one being able to take it from you!</verse>
				<verse number="23">For here is eternal truth: When that time comes you won’t need to ask me for anything, but instead you will go directly to the Father and ask him for anything you desire and he will give it to you, because of your relationship with me.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Until now you’ve not been bold enough to ask the Father for a single thing in my name, but now you can ask, and keep on asking him! And you can be sure that you’ll receive what you ask for, and your joy will have no limits!</verse>
				<verse number="25">“I have spoken to you using figurative language, but the time is coming when I will no longer teach you with veiled speech, but I will teach you about the Father with your eyes unveiled.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And I will not need to ask the Father on your behalf, for you’ll ask him directly because of your new relationship with me.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For the Father tenderly loves you, because you love me and believe that I’ve come from God.</verse>
				<verse number="28">I came to you sent from the Father’s presence, and I entered into the created world, and now I will leave this world and return to the Father’s side.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">His disciples said, “At last you’re speaking to us clearly and not using veiled speech and metaphors!</verse>
				<verse number="30">Now we understand that you know everything there is to know, and we don’t need to question you further. And everything you’ve taught us convinces us that you have come directly from God!”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Jesus replied, “Now you finally believe in me.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And the time has come when you will all be scattered, and each one of you will go your own way, leaving me alone! Yet I am never alone, for the Father is always with me.</verse>
				<verse number="33">And everything I’ve taught you is so that the peace which is in me will be in you and will give you great confidence as you rest in me. For in this unbelieving world you will experience trouble and sorrows, but you must be courageous, for I have conquered the world!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">This is what Jesus prayed as he looked up into heaven, “Father, the time has come. Unveil the glorious splendor of your Son so that I will magnify your glory!</verse>
				<verse number="2">You have already given me authority over all people so that I may give the gift of eternal life to all those that you have given to me.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Eternal life means to know and experience you as the only true God, and to know and experience Jesus Christ, as the Son whom you have sent.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I have glorified you on the earth by faithfully doing everything you’ve told me to do.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So my Father, restore me back to the glory that we shared together when we were face-to-face before the universe was created.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Father, I have manifested who you really are and I have revealed you to the men and women that you gave to me. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have fastened your Word firmly to their hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And now at last they know that everything I have is a gift from you,</verse>
				<verse number="8">And the very words you gave to me to speak I have passed on to them. They have received your words and carry them in their hearts. They are convinced that I have come from your presence, and they have fully believed that you sent me to represent you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So with deep love, I pray for my disciples. I’m not asking on behalf of the unbelieving world, but for those who belong to you, those you have given me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For all who belong to me now belong to you. And all who belong to you now belong to me as well, and my glory is revealed through their surrendered lives.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Holy Father, I am about to leave this world to return and be with you, but my disciples will remain here. Holy Father, each one that you have given me, keep them in your name so that they will be united as one, even as we are one.</verse>
				<verse number="12">While I was with these that you have given me, I was guarding them and keeping them in your name. Not one of them is lost, except the one that was destined to be lost, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“But now I am returning to you so Father, I pray that they will experience and enter into my joyous delight in you so that it is fulfilled in them and overflows.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I have given them your message and that is why the unbelieving world hates them. For their allegiance is no longer to this world because I am not of this world.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I am not asking that you remove them from the world, but I ask that you guard their hearts from evil,</verse>
				<verse number="16">For they no longer belong to this world any more than I do.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Your Word is truth! So make them holy by the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I have commissioned them to represent me just as you commissioned me to represent you.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And now I dedicate myself to them as a holy sacrifice so that they will live as fully dedicated to God and be made holy by your truth.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">“And I ask not only for these disciples, but also for all those who will one day believe in me through their message.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I pray for them all to be joined together as one even as you and I, Father, are joined together as one. I pray for them to become one with us so that the world will recognize that you sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For the very glory you have given to me I have given them so that they will be joined together as one and experience the same unity that we enjoy.</verse>
				<verse number="23">You live fully in me and now I live fully in them so that they will experience perfect unity, and the world will be convinced that you have sent me, for they will see that you love each one of them with the same passionate love that you have for me.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Father, I ask that you allow everyone that you have given to me to be with me where I am! Then they will see my full glory— the very splendor you have placed upon me because you have loved me even before the beginning of time.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“You are my righteous Father, but the unbelieving world has never known you in the perfect way that I know you! And all those who believe in me also know that you have sent me!</verse>
				<verse number="26">I have revealed to them who you are and I will continue to make you even more real to them, so that they may experience the same endless love that you have for me, for your love will now live in them, even as I live in them!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">After Jesus finished this prayer; he left with his disciples and went across the Kidron Valley to a place where there was a garden.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Judas, the traitor, knew where this place was, for Jesus had gone there often with his disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The Pharisees and the leading priests had given Judas a large detachment of Roman soldiers and temple police to seize Jesus. Judas guided them to the garden, all of them carrying torches and lanterns and armed with swords and spears.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus, knowing full well what was about to happen, went out to the garden entrance to meet them. Stepping forward, he asked, “Who are you looking for?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. (Now Judas, the traitor, was among them.) He replied, “I am he.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">And the moment Jesus spoke the words, “I am he,” the mob fell backward to the ground!</verse>
				<verse number="7">So once more, Jesus asked them, “Who are you looking for?” As they stood up, they answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus replied, “I told you that I am the one you’re looking for, so if you want me, let these men go home.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">He said this to fulfill the prophecy he had spoken, “Father, not one of those you have given me has been lost.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Suddenly, Peter took out his sword and struck the high priest’s servant, slashing off his right ear! The servant’s name was Malchus.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Jesus ordered Peter, “Put your sword away! Do you really think I will avoid the suffering which my Father has assigned to me?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then the soldiers and their captain, along with the Jewish officers, seized Jesus and tied him up.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They took him first to Annas, as he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Caiaphas was the one who had persuaded the Jewish leaders that it would be better off to have one person die for the sake of the people.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Peter and another disciple followed along behind them as they took Jesus into the courtyard of Annas’ palace. Since the other disciple was well known to the high priest, he entered in,</verse>
				<verse number="16">but Peter was left standing outside by the gate. Then the other disciple came back out to the servant girl who was guarding the gate and convinced her to allow Peter inside.</verse>
				<verse number="17">As he passed inside, the young servant girl guarding the gate took a look at Peter and said to him, “Aren’t you one of his disciples?” He denied it, saying, “No! I’m not!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now because it was cold, the soldiers and guards made a charcoal fire and were standing around it to keep warm. So Peter huddled there with them around the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The high priest interrogated Jesus concerning his disciples and his teachings.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Jesus answered Annas’ questions by saying, “I have said nothing in secret. At all times I have taught openly and publicly in a synagogue, in the temple courts, and wherever the people assemble.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Why would you ask me for evidence to condemn me? Ask those who have heard what I’ve taught. They can tell you.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Just then one of the guards standing near Jesus punched him in the face with his fist and said, “How dare you answer the high priest like that!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus replied, “If my words are evil, then prove it. But if I haven’t broken any laws, then why would you hit me?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then Annas sent Jesus, still tied up, across the way to the high priest Caiaphas.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Meanwhile, Peter was still standing in the courtyard by the fire. And one of the guards standing there said to him, “Aren’t you one of his disciples? I know you are!” Peter swore and said, “I am not his disciple!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">But one of the servants of the high priest, a relative to the man whose ear Peter had cut off, looked at him and said, “Wait! Didn’t I see you out there in the garden with Jesus?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then Peter denied it the third time and said, “No!”—and at that very same moment, a rooster crowed nearby.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Before dawn they took Jesus from his trial before Caiaphas to the Roman governor’s palace. Now the Jews refused to go into the Roman governor’s residence to avoid ceremonial defilement before eating the Passover meal.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So Pilate came outside where they waited and asked them pointedly, “Tell me, what exactly is the accusation that you bring against this man? What has he done?”</verse>
				<verse number="30">They answered, “We wouldn’t be coming here to hand over this ‘criminal’ to you if he wasn’t guilty of some wrongdoing!”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Pilate said, “Very well, then you take him yourselves and go pass judgment on him according to your Jewish laws!” But the Jewish leaders complained and said, “We don’t have legal authority to put anyone to death. You should have him crucified! ”</verse>
				<verse number="32">(This was to fulfill the words of Jesus when he predicted the manner of death that he would die.)</verse>
				<verse number="33">Upon hearing this, Pilate went back inside his palace and summoned Jesus. Looking him over, Pilate asked him, “Are you really the king of the Jews?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus replied, “Are you asking because you really want to know, or are you only asking this because others have said it about me?”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Pilate responded, “Only a Jew would care about this; do I look like a Jew? It’s your own people and your religious leaders that have handed you over to me. So tell me, Jesus, what have you done wrong?”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Jesus looked at Pilate and said, “The royal power of my kingdom realm doesn’t come from this world. If it did, then my followers would be fighting to the end to defend me from the Jewish leaders. My kingdom realm authority is not from this realm.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Then Pilate responded, “Oh, so then you are a king?” “You are right.” Jesus said, “I was born a King, and I have come into this world to prove what truth really is. And everyone who loves the truth will receive my words.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Pilate looked at Jesus and said, “What is truth?” As silence filled the room, Pilate went back out to where the Jewish leaders were waiting and said to them, “He’s not guilty. I couldn’t even find one fault with him.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Now, you do know that we have a custom that I release one prisoner every year at Passover—shall I release your king—the king of the Jews?”</verse>
				<verse number="40">They shouted out over and over, “No, not him! Give us Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was a robber and a troublemaker.)</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">Then Pilate ordered Jesus to be brutally beaten with a whip of leather straps embedded with metal.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And the soldiers also wove thorn-branches into a crown and set it on his head and placed a purple robe over his shoulders.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then, one by one, they came in front of him to mock him by saying, “Hail, to the king of the Jews!” And one after the other, they repeatedly punched him in the face.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Once more Pilate went out and said to the Jewish officials, “I will bring him out once more so that you know that I’ve found nothing wrong with him.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So when Jesus emerged, bleeding, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns on his head, Pilate said to them, “Look at him! Here is your man!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">No sooner did the high priests and the temple guards see Jesus that they all shouted in a frenzy, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” Pilate replied, “You take him then and nail him to a cross yourselves! I told you—he’s not guilty! I find no reason to condemn him.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">The Jewish leaders shouted back, “But we have the Law! And according to our Law, he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then Pilate was greatly alarmed when he heard that Jesus claimed to be the Son of God!</verse>
				<verse number="9">So he took Jesus back inside and said to him, “Where have you come from?” But once again, silence filled the room.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Perplexed, Pilate said, “Are you going to play deaf? Don’t you know that I have the power to grant you your freedom or nail you to a tree?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Jesus answered, “You would have no power over me at all, unless it was given to you from above. This is why the one who betrayed me is guilty of an even greater sin.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">From then on Pilate tried to find a way out of the situation and to set him free, but the Jewish authorities shouted him down: “If you let this man go, you’re no friend of Caesar! Anyone who declares himself a king is an enemy of the emperor!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So when Pilate heard this threat, he relented and had Jesus, who was torn and bleeding, brought outside. Then he went up the elevated stone platform and took his seat on the judgment bench—which in Aramaic is called Gabbatha, or “The Bench.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">And it was now almost noon. And it was the same day they were preparing to slay the Passover lambs. Then Pilate said to the Jewish officials, “Look! Here is your king!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">But they screamed out, “Take him away! Take him away and crucify him!” Pilate replied, “Shall I nail your king to a cross?” The high priests answered, “We have no other king but Caesar!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then Pilate handed Jesus over to them. So the soldiers seized him and took him away to be crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus carried his own cross out of the city to the place called “The Skull,” which in Aramaic is Golgotha.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And there they nailed him to the cross. He was crucified, along with two others, one on each side with Jesus in the middle.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Pilate had them post a sign over the cross, which was written in three languages—Aramaic, Latin, and Greek. Many of the people of Jerusalem read the sign, for he was crucified near the city. The sign stated: “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”</verse>
				<verse number="20"></verse>
				<verse number="21">But the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “You must change the sign! Don’t let it say, ‘King of the Jews,’ but rather—‘he claimed to be the King of the Jews!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Pilate responded, “What I have written will remain!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now when the soldiers crucified Jesus, they divided up his clothes into four shares, one for each of them. But his tunic was seamless, woven from the top to the bottom as a single garment.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So the soldiers said to each other, “Don’t tear it—let’s throw dice to see who gets it!” The soldiers did all of this not knowing they fulfilled the Scripture that says, “They divided my garments among them and gambled for my clothing.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Mary, Jesus’ mother, was standing next to his cross, along with Mary’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
				<verse number="26">So when Jesus looked down and saw the disciple he loved standing with her, he said, “Mother, look—John will be a son to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then he said, “ John, look—she will be a mother to you!” From that day on, John accepted Mary into his home as one of his own family.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Jesus knew that his mission was accomplished, and to fulfill the Scripture, Jesus said: “I am thirsty.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">A jar of sour wine was sitting nearby, so they soaked a sponge with it and put it on the stalk of hyssop and raised it to his lips.</verse>
				<verse number="30">When he had sipped the sour wine, he said, “It is finished, my bride!” Then he bowed his head and surrendered his spirit to God.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies of the victims to remain on the cross through the next day, since it was the day of preparation for a very important Sabbath. So they asked Pilate’s permission to have the victims’ legs broken to hasten their death and their bodies taken down before sunset.</verse>
				<verse number="32">So the soldiers broke the legs of the two men who were nailed there.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But when they came to Jesus, they realized that he had already died, so they decided not to break his legs.</verse>
				<verse number="34">But one of the soldiers took a spear and pierced Jesus’ side, and blood and water gushed out.</verse>
				<verse number="35">(I, John, do testify to the certainty of what took place, and I write the truth so that you might also believe.)</verse>
				<verse number="36">For all these things happened to fulfill the prophecies of the Scriptures: “Not one of his bones will be broken,”</verse>
				<verse number="37">and, “They will gaze on the one they have pierced!”</verse>
				<verse number="38">After this, Joseph from the city of Ramah, who was a secret disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jewish authorities, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. So Pilate granted him permission to remove the body from the cross.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Now Nicodemus, who had once come to Jesus privately at night, accompanied Joseph, and together they carried a significant amount of myrrh and aloes to the cross.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Then they took Jesus’ body and wrapped it in strips of linen with the embalming spices according to the Jewish burial customs.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Near the place where Jesus was crucified was a garden, and in the garden there was a new tomb where no one had yet been laid to rest.</verse>
				<verse number="42">And because the Sabbath was approaching, and the tomb was nearby, that’s where they laid the body of Jesus.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">Very early Sunday morning, before sunrise, Mary Magdalene made her way to the tomb. And when she arrived she discovered that the stone that sealed the entrance to the tomb was moved away!</verse>
				<verse number="2">So she went running as fast as she could to go tell Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved. She told them, “They’ve taken the Lord’s body from the tomb, and we don’t know where he is!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Peter and the other disciple jumped up and ran to the tomb to go see for themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They started out together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He didn’t enter the tomb, but peeked in, and saw only the linen cloths lying there.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then Peter came behind him and went right into the tomb. He too noticed the linen cloths lying there,</verse>
				<verse number="7">but the burial cloth that had been on Jesus’ head had been rolled up and placed separate from the other cloths.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first went in, and after one look, he believed!</verse>
				<verse number="9">For until then they hadn’t understood the Scriptures that prophesied that he was destined to rise from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Puzzled, Peter and the other disciple then left and went back to their homes.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Mary arrived back at the tomb, broken and sobbing. She stooped to peer inside, and through her tears</verse>
				<verse number="12">she saw two angels in dazzling white robes, sitting where Jesus’ body had been laid—one at the head and one at the feet!</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Dear woman, why are you crying?” they asked. Mary answered, “They have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they’ve laid him.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then she turned around to leave, and there was Jesus standing in front of her, but she didn’t realize that it was him!</verse>
				<verse number="15">He said to her, “Dear woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?” Mary answered, thinking he was only the gardener, “Sir, if you have taken his body somewhere else, tell me, and I will go and . . .”</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Mary,” Jesus interrupted her. Turning to face him, she said, “Rabboni!” (Aramaic for “My teacher!”)</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus cautioned her, “Mary, don’t cling to me, for I haven’t yet ascended to God, my Father. And he’s not only my Father and God, but now he’s your Father and your God! Now go to my brothers and tell them what I’ve told you, that I am ascending to my Father—and your Father, to my God—and your God!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Mary Magdalene left to inform the disciples of her encounter with Jesus. “I have seen the Lord!” she told them. And she gave them his message.</verse>
				<verse number="19">That evening, the disciples gathered together, and because they were afraid of reprisals from the Jewish leaders, they had locked the doors. But suddenly Jesus appeared among them and said, “Peace to you!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then he showed them the wounds of his hands and his side—they were overjoyed to see the Lord with their own eyes!</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus repeated his greeting, “Peace to you!” And he told them, “Just as the Father has sent me, I’m now sending you.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then, taking a deep breath, he blew on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I send you to preach the forgiveness of sins—and people’s sins will be forgiven. But if you don’t proclaim the forgiveness of their sins, they will remain guilty.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">One of the twelve wasn’t present when Jesus appeared to them—it was Thomas, whose nickname was “the Twin.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">So the disciples informed him, “We have seen the Lord with our own eyes!” Still unconvinced, Thomas replied, “There’s no way I’m going to believe this unless I personally see the wounds of the nails in his hands, touch them with my finger, and put my hand into the wound of his side where he was pierced!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then eight days later, Thomas and all the others were in the house together. And even though all the doors were locked, Jesus suddenly stood before them! “Peace to you,” he said.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then, looking into Thomas’ eyes, he said, “Put your finger here in the wounds of my hands. Here—put your hand into my wounded side and see for yourself. Thomas, don’t give in to your doubts any longer, just believe!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then the words spilled out of his heart—“You are my Lord, and you are my God!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus responded, “Thomas, now that you’ve seen me, you believe. But there are those who have never seen me with their eyes but have believed in me with their hearts, and they will be blessed even more!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Jesus went on to do many more miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not even included in this book.</verse>
				<verse number="31">But all that is recorded here is so that you will fully believe that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Son of God, and that through your faith in him you will experience eternal life by the power of his name!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">Later, Jesus appeared once again to a group of his disciples by Lake Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="2">It happened one day while Peter, Thomas (the Twin), Nathanael (from Cana in Galilee), Jacob, John, and two other disciples were all together.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Peter told them, “I’m going fishing.” And they all replied, “We’ll go with you.” So they went out and fished through the night, but caught nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then at dawn, Jesus was standing there on the shore, but the disciples didn’t realize that it was him!</verse>
				<verse number="5">He called out to them, saying, “Hey guys! Did you catch any fish?” “Not a thing,” they replied.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus shouted to them, “Throw your net over the starboard side, and you’ll catch some!” And so they did as he said, and they caught so many fish they couldn’t even pull in the net!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!” When Peter heard him say that, he quickly wrapped his outer garment around him, and because he was athletic, he dove right into the lake to go to Jesus!</verse>
				<verse number="8">The other disciples then brought the boat to shore, dragging their catch of fish. They weren’t far from land, only about a hundred meters.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And when they got to shore, they noticed a charcoal fire with some roasted fish and bread.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Jesus said, “Bring some of the fish you just caught.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So Peter waded into the water and helped pull the net to shore. It was full of many large fish, exactly one hundred and fifty-three, but even with so many fish, the net was not torn.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Come, let’s have some breakfast,” Jesus said to them. And not one of the disciples needed to ask who it was, because every one of them knew it was the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Jesus came close to them and served them the bread and the fish.</verse>
				<verse number="14">This was the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.</verse>
				<verse number="15">After they had breakfast, Jesus said to Peter, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you burn with love for me more than these?” Peter answered, “Yes, Lord! You know that I have great affection for you!” “Then take care of my lambs,” Jesus said.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Jesus repeated his question the second time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you burn with love for me?” Peter answered, “Yes, my Lord! You know that I have great affection for you!” “Then take care of my sheep,” Jesus said.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then Jesus asked him again, “Peter, son of Jonah, do you have great affection for me?” Peter was saddened by being asked the third time and said, “My Lord, you know everything. You know that I burn with love for you!” Jesus replied, “Then feed my lambs!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Peter, listen, when you were younger you made your own choices and you went where you pleased. But one day when you are old, others will tie you up and escort you where you would not choose to go—and you will spread out your arms.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">(Jesus said this to Peter as a prophecy of what kind of death he would die, for the glory of God.) And then he said, “Peter, follow me!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the disciple who sat close to Jesus at the Last Supper and had asked him, “Lord, who is the one that will betray you?”)</verse>
				<verse number="21">So when Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, “What’s going to happen to him?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Jesus replied, “If I decide to let him live until I return, what concern is that of yours? You must still keep on following me!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So the rumor started to circulate among the believers that this disciple wasn’t going to die. But Jesus never said that, he only said, “If I let him live until I return, what concern is that of yours?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">I, John, am that disciple who has written these things to testify of the truth, and we know that what I’ve documented is accurate.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus did countless things that I haven’t included here. And if every one of his works were written down and described one by one, I suppose that the world itself wouldn’t have enough room to contain the books that would have to be written!</verse>

		<book number="44">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">To Theophilus, the lover of God. I write to you again, my dear friend, to give you further details about the life of our Lord Jesus and all the things that he did and taught.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Just before he ascended into heaven, Jesus left instructions through the Holy Spirit for the apostles he had chosen.</verse>
				<verse number="3">After the sufferings of his cross, Jesus appeared alive many times to these same apostles over a forty-day period, proving to them with many convincing signs that he had been resurrected. During these encounters, he taught them the truths of God’s kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus instructed them, “Don’t leave Jerusalem, but wait here until you receive the gift I told you about, the gift the Father has promised.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For John baptized you in water, but in a few days from now you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Every time they were gathered together, they asked Jesus, “Lord, is it now the time for you to free Israel and restore our kingdom?”</verse>
				<verse number="7">He answered, “The Father is the one who sets the fixed dates and the times of their fulfillment. You are not permitted to know the timing of all that he has prepared by his own authority.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But I promise you this—the Holy Spirit will come upon you, and you will be seized with power. You will be my messengers to Jerusalem, throughout Judea, the distant provinces —even to the remotest places on earth!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Right after Jesus spoke those words, the disciples saw him being lifted into the sky, and disappearing into a cloud!</verse>
				<verse number="10">As they stared into the sky, watching Jesus ascend, two men in white robes suddenly appeared beside them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They told the startled disciples, “Galileans, why are you staring up into the sky? Jesus has been taken from you into heaven, but he will come back in the same way that you saw him ascend.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">The disciples left the Mount of Olives and returned to Jerusalem, which was less than a mile away.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Arriving there, they went into a large second-floor room to pray. Those present were Peter, John, Jacob, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, Jacob (the son of Alpheus), Simon (the zealot), Judas (the son of Jacob), and a number of women, including Mary, Jesus’ mother. His brothers were there as well. All of them were united in prayer, gripped with one passion, interceding night and day.</verse>
				<verse number="14"></verse>
				<verse number="15">During this time Peter stood up among the 120 believers who were gathered and said,</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Fellow believers, the Scripture David prophesied by the Holy Spirit concerning Judas had to be fulfilled. Judas betrayed our Lord Jesus and led the mob to the garden to arrest him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He was one of us, and he was chosen to be an apostle just as we were.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He earned the wages of his sin, for he fell headfirst, and his belly split open, spilling his intestines on the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Everyone in Jerusalem knows what happened to him. That’s why the field where he died is called in Aramaic ‘Haqel Dama,’ that is, ‘The Bloody Field.’</verse>
				<verse number="20">For it is written in the Psalms: ‘Let his house be deserted and become a wasteland. No one will live there.’ And also: ‘Let another take his ministry.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">“So then, we must choose his replacement from among those who have been with us from the very beginning,</verse>
				<verse number="22">from John’s baptism until Jesus’ ascension. And, like us, he must be a witness of his resurrection.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">They proposed two candidates: Joseph, who is also called Barsabbas the Just, and Matthias.</verse>
				<verse number="24">They all prayed, “Lord Yahweh, you know the heart of every man. Please give us clear revelation to know which of these two men you have chosen</verse>
				<verse number="25">to be an apostle and take Judas’ place because he renounced his apostleship to go where he belonged.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">They cast lots and determined that Matthias was the Lord’s choice, so he was added to the eleven apostles.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">On the day Pentecost was being fulfilled, all the disciples were gathered in one place.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Suddenly they heard the sound of a violent blast of wind rushing into the house from out of the heavenly realm. The roar of the wind was so overpowering it was all anyone could bear!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then all at once a pillar of fire appeared before their eyes. It separated into tongues of fire that engulfed each one of them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They were all filled and equipped with the Holy Spirit and were inspired to speak in tongues—empowered by the Spirit to speak in languages they had never learned!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now, at that time there were Jewish worshipers who had emigrated from many different lands to live in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When the people of the city heard the roaring sound, crowds came running to where it was coming from, stunned over what was happening, because each one could hear the disciples speaking in his or her own language.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Bewildered, they said to one another, “Aren’t these all Galileans?</verse>
				<verse number="8">So how is it that we hear them speaking in our own languages?</verse>
				<verse number="9">We are northeastern Iranians, northwestern Iranians, Elamites, and those from Mesopotamia, Judea, east central Turkey, the coastal areas of the Black Sea, Asia,</verse>
				<verse number="10">north central Turkey, southern Turkey, Egypt, Libyans who are neighbors of Cyrene, visitors from all over the Roman Empire, both Jews and converts to Judaism, Cretans and Arabs.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yet we hear them speaking of God’s mighty wonders in our own dialects!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">They all stood there, dumbfounded and astonished, saying to one another, “What is this phenomenon?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">But others poked fun at them and said, “They’re just drunk on new wine.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Peter stood up with the eleven apostles and shouted to the crowd. “Listen carefully, my fellow Jews and residents of Jerusalem. You need to clearly understand what’s happening here.</verse>
				<verse number="15">These people are not drunk like you think they are, for it is only nine o’clock in the morning.</verse>
				<verse number="16">This is the fulfillment of what was prophesied through the prophet Joel, for God says:</verse>
				<verse number="17">‘This is what I will do in the last days —I will pour out my Spirit on everybody and cause your sons and daughters to prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will experience dreams from God.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The Holy Spirit will come upon all my servants, men and women alike, and they will prophesy.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I will reveal startling signs and wonders in the sky above and mighty miracles on the earth below. Blood and fire and pillars of clouds will appear.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For the sun will be turned dark and the moon blood-red before that great and awesome appearance of the day of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Peter continued, “People of Israel, listen to the facts. Jesus, the Victorious, was a man on a divine mission whose authority was clearly proven. For you know how God performed many powerful miracles, signs, and wonders through him.</verse>
				<verse number="23">This Man’s destiny was prearranged, for God knew that Jesus would be handed over to you to be crucified and that you would execute him on a cross by the hands of lawless men. Yet it was all part of his predetermined plan.</verse>
				<verse number="24">God destroyed the cords of death and raised him up, because it was impossible for death’s power to hold him prisoner.</verse>
				<verse number="25">This is the very thing David prophesied about him: ‘I continually see the Lord in front of me. He’s at my right hand, and I am never shaken.</verse>
				<verse number="26">No wonder my heart is glad and my glory celebrates! My mouth is filled with his praises, and I have hope that my body will live</verse>
				<verse number="27">because you will not leave my soul among the dead, nor will you allow your sacred one to experience decay.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For you have revealed to me the pathways to life, and seeing your face fills me with euphoria!’</verse>
				<verse number="29">“My fellow Jews, I can tell you there is no doubt that our noted patriarch has both died and been buried in his tomb, which remains to this day. So you can see that he was not referring to himself with those words.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But as a prophet, he knew God’s faithful promise, made with God’s unbreakable oath, that one of his descendants would take his throne.</verse>
				<verse number="31">So when peering into the future, David prophesied of the Messiah’s resurrection. And God revealed to him that the Messiah would not be abandoned to the realm of death, nor would his body experience decay.</verse>
				<verse number="32">“Can’t you see it? God has resurrected Jesus, and we all have seen him!</verse>
				<verse number="33">“Then God exalted him to his right hand upon the throne of highest honor. And the Father gave him the authority to send the promised Holy Spirit, which is being poured out upon us today. This is what you’re seeing and hearing!</verse>
				<verse number="34">“David wasn’t the one who ascended into heaven, but the one who prophesied: ‘ Yahweh said to my Lord, I honor you by enthroning you beside me,</verse>
				<verse number="35">until I make your enemies a footstool beneath your feet.’</verse>
				<verse number="36">“Now everyone in Israel can know for certain that Jesus, whom you crucified, is the one God has made both Lord and the Messiah.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">When they heard this they were crushed and realized what they had done to Jesus. Deeply moved, they said to Peter and the other apostles, “What do we need to do, brothers?”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Peter replied, “Repent and return to God, and each one of you must be baptized in the name of Jesus, the Anointed One, to have your sins removed. Then you may take hold of the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="39">For God’s promise of the Holy Spirit is for you and your families, for those yet to be born and for everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Peter preached to them and warned them with these words: “Be rescued from the wayward and perverse culture of this world!”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Those who believed the word that day numbered three thousand. They were all baptized and added to the church.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Every believer was faithfully devoted to following the teachings of the apostles. Their hearts were mutually linked to one another, sharing communion and coming together regularly for prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="43">A deep sense of holy awe swept over everyone, and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders.</verse>
				<verse number="44">All the believers were in fellowship as one body, and they shared with one another whatever they had.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Out of generosity they even sold their assets to distribute the proceeds to those who were in need among them.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Daily they met together in the temple courts and in one another’s homes to celebrate communion. They shared meals together with joyful hearts and tender humility.</verse>
				<verse number="47">They were continually filled with praises to God, enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord kept adding to their number daily those who were coming to life.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">One afternoon Peter and John went to the temple for the three o’clock prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="2">As they came to the entrance called the Beautiful Gate, they were captured by the sight of a man crippled from birth being carried and placed at the entrance to the temple. He was often brought there to beg for money from those going in to worship.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When he noticed Peter and John going into the temple, he begged them for money.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Peter and John, looking straight into the eyes of the crippled man, said, “Look at us!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Expecting a gift, he readily gave them his attention.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then Peter said, “I don’t have money, but I’ll give you this—by the power of the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Peter held out his right hand to the crippled man. As he pulled the man to his feet, suddenly power surged into his crippled feet and ankles. The man jumped up, stood there for a moment stunned, and then began to walk around! As he went into the temple courts with Peter and John, he leapt for joy and shouted praises to God.</verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">When all the people saw him jumping up and down and heard him glorifying God,</verse>
				<verse number="10">they realized it was the crippled beggar they had passed by in front of the Beautiful Gate. Astonishment swept over the crowd, for they were amazed over what had happened to him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Dumbfounded over what they were witnessing, the crowd ran over to Peter and John, who were standing under the covered walkway called Solomon’s Porch. Standing there also was the healed beggar, clinging to Peter and John.</verse>
				<verse number="12">With the crowd surrounding him, Peter said to them all, “People of Israel, listen to me! Why are you so amazed by this healing? Why do you stare at us? We didn’t make this crippled man walk by our own power or authority.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The God of our ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has done this. For he has glorified his Servant Jesus, the one you denied to Pilate’s face when he decided to release him—and you insisted that he be crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You rejected the one who is holy and righteous, and instead begged for a murderer to be released.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You killed the Prince of Life! But God raised him from the dead, and we stand here as witnesses to that fact.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Faith in Jesus’ name has healed this man standing before you. It is the faith that comes through believing in Jesus’ name that has made the crippled man walk right in front of your eyes!</verse>
				<verse number="17">“My fellow Jews, I realize that neither you nor your leaders realize the grave mistake you made.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But in spite of what you’ve done, God has fulfilled what he foretold through the prophets long ago about the sufferings of his Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And now you must repent and turn back to God so that your sins will be removed, and so that times of refreshing will stream from the Lord’s presence.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And he will send you Jesus, the Messiah, the appointed one.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For he must remain in heaven until the restoration of all things has taken place, fulfilling everything that God said long ago through his holy prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For has not Moses told us: ‘The Lord your God will raise up a prophet from among you who is like me. Listen to him and follow everything he tells you.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Every person who disobeys that prophet will be cut off and completely destroyed.’</verse>
				<verse number="24">“In fact, every prophet from the time of Samuel onward has prophesied of these very days!</verse>
				<verse number="25">And you are heirs of their prophecies and of the covenants God made with your fathers when he promised Abraham, ‘Your descendant will bring blessing to all the people on the earth.’</verse>
				<verse number="26">“Now that God raised up his Son, he has chosen to send him first to you that he might bless you by turning each one of you from your wickedness.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">The teaching and preaching of Peter and John angered the priests, the captain of the temple police, and representatives of the Jewish sect of the Sadducees. They were furious that the people were being taught that in Jesus there is a resurrection from the dead. So while Peter and John were still speaking, the Jewish authorities came to the temple courts to oppose them.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">They had them arrested, and since it was already evening they kept them in custody until the next day.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yet there were many in the crowd who believed the message, bringing the total number of men who believed to nearly five thousand!</verse>
				<verse number="5">The next day many Jewish leaders, religious scholars, and elders of the people convened a meeting in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Annas the high priest was there with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others who were members of the high priest’s family.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They made Peter and John stand in front of the council as they questioned them, saying, “Tell us, by what power and authority have you done these things?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, answered, “Respected elders and leaders of the people, listen.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Are we being put on trial today for doing an act of kindness by healing a frail, crippled man? Well then,</verse>
				<verse number="10">you and everyone else in Israel should know that it is by the power of the name of Jesus that the crippled man stands here today completely healed! You crucified Jesus Christ of Nazareth, but God raised him from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This Jesus is ‘the stone that you, the builders, have rejected, and now he has become the cornerstone!’</verse>
				<verse number="12">There is no one else who has the power to save us, for there is only one name to whom God has given authority by which we must experience salvation: the name of Jesus.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">The council members were astonished as they witnessed the bold courage of Peter and John, especially when they discovered that they were just ordinary men who had never had religious training. Then they began to understand the effect Jesus had on them simply by spending time with him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Standing there with them was the healed man, and there was nothing further they could say.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So they ordered them to leave the room while they discussed the matter. Among themselves, they said,</verse>
				<verse number="16">“What should we do with these men? Everyone in Jerusalem can clearly see that they’ve performed a notable sign and wonder—we can’t deny that.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But to keep this propaganda from spreading any further among the people, let’s threaten them severely and warn them to never speak to anyone in this name again.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">So they had them brought back in before the council, and they commanded them to never teach the people or speak again using the name of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But Peter and John replied, “You can judge for yourselves—is it better to listen to you or to God?</verse>
				<verse number="20">It’s impossible for us to stop speaking about all the things we’ve seen and heard!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Since the members of the council couldn’t come up with a crime they could punish them for, they threatened them once more and let them go. All the people praised God, thrilled over the miraculous healing of the crippled man.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And the man who received this miracle sign of healing was over forty years old.</verse>
				<verse number="23">As soon as they were released from custody, Peter and John went to the other believers and explained all that had happened with the high priest and the elders.</verse>
				<verse number="24">When the believers heard their report, they raised their voices in unity and prayed, “Lord Yahweh, you are the Lord of all! You created the universe—the earth, the sky, the sea, and everything that is in them.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And you spoke by the Holy Spirit through your servant David, our forefather, saying: ‘How dare the nations plan a rebellion, ranting and raging against the Lord Most High? Their foolish plots are futile!</verse>
				<verse number="26">Look at how the kings of the earth take their stand, with the rulers scheming and conspiring together against God and his anointed Messiah!’</verse>
				<verse number="27">“In fact, Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with Jews and non-Jews, met together to take their stand against your holy servant, Jesus the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="28">They did to him all that your purpose and will had determined, according to the destiny you had marked out for him.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So now, Lord, listen to their threats to harm us. Empower us, as your servants, to speak the word of God freely and courageously.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Stretch out your hand of power through us to heal, and to move in signs and wonders by the name of your holy Son, Jesus!”</verse>
				<verse number="31">As they prayed the earth shook beneath them, causing the building they were in to tremble. Each one of them was filled with the Holy Spirit, and they proclaimed the word of God with unrestrained boldness.</verse>
				<verse number="32">All the believers were one in mind and heart. Selfishness was not a part of their community, for they shared everything they had with one another.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The apostles gave powerful testimonies about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great measures of grace rested upon them all.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Some who owned houses or land sold them and brought the proceeds before the apostles to distribute to those without. Not a single person among them was needy.</verse>
				<verse number="35"></verse>
				<verse number="36">For example, there was a Levite from Cyprus named Joseph, who sold his farmland and placed the proceeds at the feet of the apostles. They nicknamed him Barnabas (or “Encourager”).</verse>
				<verse number="37"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Now, a man named Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, likewise sold their farm.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They conspired to secretly keep back for themselves a portion of the proceeds. So when Ananias brought the money to the apostles, it was only a portion of the entire sale.</verse>
				<verse number="3">God revealed their secret to Peter, so he said to him, “Ananias, why did you let Satan fill your heart and make you think you could lie to the Holy Spirit? You only pretended to give it all, yet you hid back part of the proceeds from the sale of your property to keep for yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Before you sold it, wasn’t it yours to sell or to keep? And after you sold it, wasn’t the money entirely at your disposal? How could you plot such a thing in your heart? You haven’t lied to people; you’ve lied to God!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The moment Ananias heard those words, he fell over dead. Everyone was terrified when they heard what had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Some young men came in and removed the body and buried him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Three hours later, his wife came into the room, with no clue what had happened to her husband.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Peter said to her, “Tell me, were the two of you paid this amount for the sale of your land?” Sapphira said, “Yes, that’s how much it was.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Peter told her, “Why have you agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? I hear the footsteps of those who buried your husband at the door—they’re coming here to bury you too!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">At that moment she dropped dead at Peter’s feet. When the young men came in, she was already dead, so they carried her out and buried her next to her husband.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The entire church was seized with a powerful sense of the fear of God, which came over all who heard what had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The apostles performed many signs, wonders, and miracles among the people.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And the believers were wonderfully united as they met regularly in the temple courts in the area known as Solomon’s Porch. No one dared harm them, for everyone held them in high regard.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Continually more and more people believed in the Lord and were added to their number—great crowds of both men and women.</verse>
				<verse number="15">In fact, when people knew Peter was going to walk by, they carried the sick out to the streets and laid them down on cots and mats, knowing the incredible power emanating from him would overshadow them and heal them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Great numbers of people swarmed into Jerusalem from the nearby villages. They brought with them the sick and those troubled by demons—and everyone was healed!</verse>
				<verse number="17">The high priest and his officials, who formed the party of the Sadducees, became extremely jealous over all that was happening,</verse>
				<verse number="18">so they had the apostles arrested, placed in chains, and thrown into jail.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But during the night, the Lord sent an angel who appeared before them. He supernaturally opened their prison doors and brought the apostles outside.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Go,” the angel told them. “Stand in the temple courts and preach the words that bring life!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">So early that morning they entered the temple courts and taught the people. The high priest and his officials, unaware of their supernatural release from prison, convened the members of the supreme council. They sent for the apostles to be brought to them from prison.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But when the officers came to the prison cell, it was empty! They returned to the council and informed them,</verse>
				<verse number="23">“We found the jail securely locked and the guards standing by their cell, but when we opened the door, there was no one inside!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">When the captain of the temple guard and the leading priests heard this report, they were perplexed and at a loss over what to make of it.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Someone came and informed them, “The men you put in prison are out there standing in the temple courts, teaching the people!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">So the captain of the temple guard and his officers went to arrest them once again, but without using force, for they were afraid the people would stone them.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When they brought them before the council, the high priest demanded an explanation,</verse>
				<verse number="28">saying, “Didn’t we strictly warn you that you were to never again teach in this name? But instead you have now filled all of Jerusalem with this doctrine and are committed to holding us responsible for this man’s death!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Peter and the apostles replied, “We must listen to and obey God more than pleasing religious leaders.</verse>
				<verse number="30">You had Jesus arrested and killed by crucifixion, but the God of our forefathers has raised him up.</verse>
				<verse number="31">He’s the one God has exalted and seated at his right hand as our Savior and Champion. He is the provider of grace as the Redeemer of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="32">We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God freely gives to all who believe in him.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">When they heard this, they were infuriated and determined to murder them.</verse>
				<verse number="34">But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a noted religious professor who was highly respected by all, stood up. He gave orders to send the apostles outside.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then he said to the council, “Men of Israel, you need to be very careful about how you deal with these men.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Some time ago there was a man named Theudas who rose up claiming to be somebody. He had a following of about four hundred men, but when he was killed, all of his followers were scattered, and nothing came of it.</verse>
				<verse number="37">“After him, in the days of the census, another man rose up, Judas the Galilean, who got people to follow him in a revolt. He too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered.</verse>
				<verse number="38">So in this situation, you should just leave these men to themselves. For if this plan or undertaking originates with men, it will fade away and come to nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="39">But if this movement is of God, you won’t be able to stop it. And you might discover that you were fighting God all along!” Gamaliel’s words convinced the council.</verse>
				<verse number="40">So they brought the apostles back in and had them severely beaten. They ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus and then let them go.</verse>
				<verse number="41">The apostles left there rejoicing, thrilled that God had considered them worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="42">And nothing stopped them! They kept preaching every day in the temple courts and went from house to house, preaching the gospel of Jesus, God’s Anointed One!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">During those days the number of Jesus’ followers kept multiplying greatly. But a complaint was brought against those who spoke Aramaic by the Greek-speaking Jews, who felt their widows were being overlooked during the daily distribution of food.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The twelve apostles called a meeting of all the believers and told them, “It is not advantageous for us to be pulled away from the word of God to wait on tables.</verse>
				<verse number="3">We want you to carefully select from among yourselves seven godly men. Make sure they are honorable, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, and we will give them the responsibility of this crucial ministry of serving.</verse>
				<verse number="4">That will enable us to give our full attention to prayer and preaching the word of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Everyone in the church loved this idea. So they chose seven men. One of them was Stephen, who was known as a man full of faith and overflowing with the Holy Spirit. Along with him they chose Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas from Antioch, who had converted to Judaism.</verse>
				<verse number="6">All seven stood before the apostles, who laid their hands on them and prayed for them, commissioning them to this ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="7">God’s word reigned supreme and kept spreading. The number of Jesus’ followers in Jerusalem quickly grew and increased by the day. Even a great number of Jewish priests became believers and were obedient to the faith!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Stephen, who was a man full of grace and supernatural power, performed many astonishing signs and wonders and mighty miracles among the people.</verse>
				<verse number="9">This upset some men belonging to a sect who called themselves the Men Set Free. They were Libyans, Egyptians, and Turks. They all confronted Stephen to argue with him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But the Holy Spirit gave Stephen remarkable wisdom to answer them. His words were prompted by the Holy Spirit, and they could not refute what he said.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So the Men Set Free conspired in secret to find those who would bring false accusations against Stephen and lie about him by saying, “We heard this man speak blasphemy against Moses and God.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">The Men Set Free agitated the crowd, the elders, and the religious scholars, then seized Stephen and forcefully took him before the supreme council.</verse>
				<verse number="13">One after another, false witnesses stepped forward and accused Stephen, saying, “This man never stops denigrating our temple and our Jewish law.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For we have heard him teach that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy the temple and change the traditions and customs that Moses handed down to us.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Every member of the supreme council focused his gaze on Stephen, for right in front of their eyes, while being falsely accused, his face glowed as though he had the face of an angel!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">The high priest asked, “Are these accusations true?”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Stephen replied, “My fellow Jews and fathers, listen to me. The God of glory appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was living in Iraq and before he moved to Haran in Syria.</verse>
				<verse number="3">God said to him, ‘Go! Leave behind your country and your relatives. Begin your journey and come to the land that I will show you.’</verse>
				<verse number="4">“So Abraham left southeastern Iraq and began his journey. He settled in Haran and stayed there until his father passed away. Then God had him move to the land of Israel with only a promise.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Although God gave him no parcel of land he could call his own, not even a footprint, yet he promised Abraham that he and his descendants would one day have it all. And even though as yet Abraham had no child,</verse>
				<verse number="6">God spoke with him and gave him this promise: ‘Your descendants will live in a foreign land with a people who will make slaves of them and oppress them for four hundred years.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But I will judge the nation that enslaves them, and your descendants will be set free to return to this land to serve and worship me.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Then God entered into covenant with Abraham, which included the requirement of circumcision. So when he became the father of Isaac, he circumcised him eight days after his birth.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Isaac then became the father of Jacob, who was the father of our twelve patriarchs. Jacob’s sons became jealous of their brother Joseph and sold him to be a slave in Egypt. But God’s favor and blessing rested upon Joseph, and in time,</verse>
				<verse number="10">God rescued him from all his oppression and granted him extraordinary favor before Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh appointed him as the overseer of his nation and even of his own palace.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Then a devastating famine came over all of Egypt and Canaan, bringing great misery to the people, including our ancestors, who couldn’t find food.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But when Jacob learned that there was food in Egypt, he sent his sons, our ancestors, on their first trip to purchase grain for their family.</verse>
				<verse number="13">On their second trip to Egypt, Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers, and because of this, Pharaoh learned about Joseph’s family and where he came from.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Joseph sent for his father, Jacob, and his entire family, a total of seventy-five people, to come and reside in Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Eventually, Jacob died there, along with all of his sons, our forefathers.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Their bones were later carried back to the promised land and buried in Shechem, in the tomb Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“The time drew near for God to fulfill the prophetic promise he had made to Abraham. Our Jewish people had increased greatly in number, multiplying many times over while in Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Another king, who had forgotten how Joseph had made their nation great, arose to rule over Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He was an abusive king who exploited our people with his smooth talk. With cruelty he forced our ancestors to give up their little boys as he committed infanticide!</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Then Moses came on the scene—a child of divine beauty. His parents hid him from Pharaoh as long as they could to spare his life. After three months they could conceal him no longer,</verse>
				<verse number="21">so they had to abandon him to his fate. But God arranged that Pharaoh’s daughter would find him, take him home, and raise him as her own son.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So Moses was fully trained in the royal courts and educated in the highest wisdom Egypt had to offer, until he arose as a powerful prince and an eloquent orator.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“When Moses turned forty, his heart was stirred for his people, the Israelites.</verse>
				<verse number="24">One day he saw one of our people being violently mistreated, so he came to his rescue, and with his own hands Moses murdered the abusive Egyptian.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Moses hoped that when the people realized how he had rescued one of their own, they would recognize him as their deliverer. How wrong he was!</verse>
				<verse number="26">The next day he came upon two of our people engaged in a fist fight, and he tried to break it up by saying, ‘Men, you are brothers! Why would you want to hurt each other?’</verse>
				<verse number="27">“But the perpetrator pushed Moses aside and said, ‘Who do you think you are? Who appointed you to be our ruler and judge?</verse>
				<verse number="28">Are you going to kill me like you did the Egyptian yesterday?’</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Shaken by this, Moses fled Egypt and lived as an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.</verse>
				<verse number="30">After forty years had passed, while he was in the desert near Mount Sinai, the Messenger of Yahweh appeared to him in the midst of a flaming thorn bush.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Moses was astonished and stunned by what he was seeing, so he drew closer to observe this marvel. Then the Lord Yahweh spoke to him out of the flames:</verse>
				<verse number="32">‘I am the living God, the God of your ancestors. I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ “Trembling in God’s presence and overwhelmed with awe, Moses didn’t even dare to look into the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“Out of the flames the Lord Yahweh said to him: ‘Take the sandals off your feet, for you are standing in the realm of holiness.</verse>
				<verse number="34">I have watched and seen how my people have been mistreated in Egypt. I have heard their painful groaning, and now I have come down to set them free. So come to me, Moses, for I am sending you to Egypt to represent me.’</verse>
				<verse number="35">“So God sent back to Egypt the man our people rejected and refused to recognize by saying, ‘Who appointed you to be our ruler and judge?’ God sent this man back to be their ruler and deliverer, commissioned with the power of the messenger who appeared to him in the flaming thorn bush.</verse>
				<verse number="36">This man brought the people out from their Egyptian bondage with many astonishing wonders and miracle signs—miracles in Egypt, miracles at the Red Sea, and miracles during their forty-year journey through the wilderness.</verse>
				<verse number="37">This is the same Moses who said to our ancestors, ‘The Lord God will raise up one from among you who will be a prophet to you, like I have been. Listen to everything he will say!’</verse>
				<verse number="38">“Moses led the congregation in the wilderness and he spoke face-to-face with the angel who spoke with him on the top of Mount Sinai. Along with our ancestors, he received the living oracles of God that were passed down to us.</verse>
				<verse number="39">But our forefathers refused to obey. They pushed him away, and their hearts longed to return to Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="40">“While Moses was on the mountain, our forefathers said to Aaron, ‘Make us gods to lead us, because we don’t know what has become of this Moses who brought us out of Egypt.’</verse>
				<verse number="41">“So they made a god, an idol in the form of a bull calf. They offered sacrifices to it and celebrated with delight what their own hands had made.</verse>
				<verse number="42">“When God saw what they had done, he turned away from them and handed them over to the worship of the stars of heaven, as recorded in the prophetic writings: ‘People of Israel, you failed to worship me when you offered animal sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Instead you worshiped the god Moloch, and you carried his tabernacle, not mine. You worshiped your star-god, Rephan. You made idols with your hands and worshiped them instead of me. So now I will cast you into exile beyond Babylon.’</verse>
				<verse number="44">“God gave Moses the revelation of the pattern of the tabernacle of the testimony. By God’s command, he made it exactly according to the specifications given to him for our ancestors in the wilderness.</verse>
				<verse number="45">The next generation received possession of it, and under Joshua’s leadership they took possession of the land of the nations, which God drove out in front of them. The tabernacle was carried about until</verse>
				<verse number="46">David found loving favor with God and prayed for a dwelling place for the God of Jacob,</verse>
				<verse number="47">but it was Solomon who built him a house.</verse>
				<verse number="48">“However, the Most High God does not live in temples made by human hands, as the prophet said:</verse>
				<verse number="49">‘Heaven is my throne room and the earth is but a footstool for my feet. How could you possibly build a house that could contain me?’ says the Lord Yahweh. ‘And where could you find a place where I could live?</verse>
				<verse number="50">Don’t you know that it is my hands that have built my house, not yours?’</verse>
				<verse number="51">“Why would you be so stubborn as to close your hearts and your ears to me? You are always opposing the Holy Spirit, just like your forefathers!</verse>
				<verse number="52">Which prophet was not persecuted and murdered by your ancestors? Name just one! They killed them all—even the ones who prophesied long ago of the coming of the Righteous One! Now you follow in their steps and have become his betrayers and murderers.</verse>
				<verse number="53">You have been given the law by the visitation of angels, but you have not obeyed it.”</verse>
				<verse number="54">When they heard these things, they were overtaken with violent rage filling their souls, and they gnashed their teeth at him.</verse>
				<verse number="55">But Stephen, overtaken with great faith, was full of the Holy Spirit. He fixed his gaze into the heavenly realm and saw the glory and splendor of God—and Jesus, who stood up at the right hand of God.</verse>
				<verse number="56">“Look!” Stephen said. “I can see the heavens opening and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God to welcome me home!”</verse>
				<verse number="57">His accusers covered their ears with their hands and screamed at the top of their lungs to drown out his voice.</verse>
				<verse number="58">Then they pounced on him and threw him outside the city walls to stone him. His accusers, one by one, placed their outer garments at the feet of a young man named Saul of Tarsus.</verse>
				<verse number="59">As they hurled stone after stone at him, Stephen prayed, “Our Lord Jesus, accept my spirit into your presence.”</verse>
				<verse number="60">He crumpled to his knees and shouted in a loud voice, “Our Lord, don’t hold this sin against them.” And then he died.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Now, Saul agreed to be an accomplice to Stephen’s stoning and participated in his execution. From that day on, a great persecution of the church in Jerusalem began. All the believers scattered into the countryside of Judea and among the Samaritans, except the apostles who remained behind in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="2">God-fearing men gave Stephen a proper burial and mourned greatly over his death.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Saul mercilessly persecuted the church of God, going from house to house into the homes of believers to arrest both men and women and drag them off to prison.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Although the believers were scattered by persecution, they preached the wonderful news of the word of God wherever they went.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Philip traveled to a Samaritan city and preached to them the wonderful news of the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The crowds were eager to receive Philip’s message and were persuaded by the many miracles and wonders he performed.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Many demon-possessed people were set free and delivered as evil spirits came out of them with loud screams and shrieks, and many who were lame and paralyzed were also healed.</verse>
				<verse number="8">This resulted in an uncontainable joy filling the city!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now, there was a man who lived there who was steeped in sorcery. For some time he had astounded the people of Samaria with his magic, boasting to be someone great.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Everyone, from the least to the greatest among them, was dazzled by his sorcery, saying, “This man is the greatest wizard of all! The divine power of God walks among us!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">For many years everyone was in awe of him because of his astonishing displays of the magic arts.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But as Philip preached the wonderful news of God’s kingdom realm, and the name of Jesus the Anointed One, many believed his message and were baptized, both men and women.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Even Simon believed and was baptized! Wherever Philip went, Simon was right by his side, astounded by all the miracles, signs, and enormous displays of power that he witnessed.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had accepted God’s message of life, they sent Peter and John</verse>
				<verse number="15">to pray over them so that they would receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and were yet to have the Holy Spirit fall upon them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">As soon as Peter and John arrived, they laid their hands on the Samaritan believers, one after another, and the Holy Spirit fell and filled each one of them!</verse>
				<verse number="18">When Simon saw how the Holy Spirit was released through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he approached them and offered them money,</verse>
				<verse number="19">saying, “I want this power too. I’m willing to pay you for the anointing that you have, so that I also can lay my hands on everyone to receive the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Peter rebuked him and said, “Your money will go with you to destruction! How could you even think that you could purchase God’s supernatural gift with money?</verse>
				<verse number="21">You will never have this gift or take part in this ministry, for your heart is not right with God.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Repent this moment for allowing such wickedness to fill you. Plead with the Lord that perhaps he would forgive you the treachery of your heart.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For I discern that jealous envy has poisoned you and binds you as a captive to sin.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Simon begged, “Peter, please pray to God for me. Plead with him so that nothing you just said over me may come to pass!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">After Peter and John had testified and taught the word of God in that city, they returned to Jerusalem, stopping at many Samaritan villages along the way to preach the hope of the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then the Lord’s angel said to Philip, “Now go south from Jerusalem on the desert road to Gaza.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">He left immediately on his assignment. Along the way he encountered an Ethiopian who believed in the God of the Jews, who was the minister of finance for Candace, queen of Ethiopia. He was on his way home from worshiping God in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="28">As he rode along in his chariot, he was reading from the scroll of Isaiah.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The Holy Spirit said to Philip, “Go and walk alongside the chariot.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">So Philip ran to catch up. As he drew closer he overheard the man reading from the scroll of Isaiah the prophet. Philip asked him, “Sir, do you understand what you’re reading?”</verse>
				<verse number="31">The man answered, “How can I possibly make sense of this without someone explaining it to me?” So he invited Philip up into his chariot to sit with him.</verse>
				<verse number="32">The portion from Isaiah he was reading was this: He was led away to the slaughter like a lamb to be offered. He was like a lamb that is silent before those who sheared him— he never even opened his mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="33">In his lowliness justice was stripped away from him. And who could fully express his struggles? For his life was taken from the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="34">The Ethiopian asked Philip, “Please, can you tell me who the prophet is speaking of? Is it himself or another man?”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Philip started with this passage and shared with him the wonderful message of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="36">As they were traveling down the road, the man said, “Look, here’s a pool of water. Why don’t I get baptized right now?”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Philip replied, “If you believe with all your heart, I’ll baptize you.” The man answered, “I believe that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Son of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">The Ethiopian stopped his chariot, and they went down into the water and Philip baptized him.</verse>
				<verse number="39">When they came up out of the water, Philip was suddenly snatched up by the Spirit of the Lord and instantly carried away to the city of Ashdod, where he reappeared, preaching the gospel in that city. The man never saw Philip again. He returned to Ethiopia full of great joy. Philip, however, traveled on to all of the towns of that region, bringing them the good news, until he arrived at Caesarea.</verse>
				<verse number="40"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">During those days, Saul, full of angry threats and rage, wanted to murder the disciples of the Lord Jesus. So he went to ask the high priest</verse>
				<verse number="2">and requested a letter of authorization he could take to the Jewish leaders in Damascus, requesting their cooperation in finding and arresting any who were followers of the Way. Saul wanted to capture all of the believers he found, both men and women, and drag them as prisoners back to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So he obtained the authorization and left for Damascus. Just outside the city, a brilliant light flashing from heaven suddenly exploded all around him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Falling to the ground, he heard a booming voice say to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The men accompanying Saul were stunned and speechless, for they heard a heavenly voice but could see no one. Saul replied, “Who are you, Lord?” “I am Jesus, the Victorious, the one you are persecuting. Now, get up and go into the city, where you will be told what you are to do.”</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">Saul stood to his feet, and even though his eyes were open he could see nothing—he was blind. So the men had to take him by the hand and lead him into Damascus.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For three days he didn’t eat or drink and couldn’t see a thing.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Living in Damascus was a believer named Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, calling his name. “Ananias.” “Yes, Lord,” Ananias answered.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The Lord said, “Go at once to the street called Abundance and look for a man from Tarsus named Saul. You will find him at Judah’s house. While he was praying, he saw in a supernatural vision a man named Ananias coming to lay hands upon him to restore his sight.”</verse>
				<verse number="12"></verse>
				<verse number="13">“But Lord,” Ananias replied, “many have told me about his terrible persecution of those in Jerusalem who are devoted to you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">In fact, the high priest has authorized him to seize and imprison all those in Damascus who call on your name.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">The Lord Yahweh answered him, “Arise and go! I have chosen this man to be my special messenger. He will be brought before kings, before many nations, and before the Jewish people to give them the revelation of who I am.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And I will show him how much he is destined to suffer because of his passion for me.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Ananias left and found the house where Saul was staying. He went inside and laid hands on him, saying, “Saul, my brother, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road, has sent me to pray for you so that you might see again and be filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">All at once, the crusty substance that was over Saul’s eyes disappeared and he could see perfectly. Immediately, he got up and was baptized.</verse>
				<verse number="19">After eating a meal, his strength returned.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Within the hour he was in the synagogues, preaching about Jesus and proclaiming, “Jesus is the Son of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Those who heard him were astonished, saying among themselves, “Isn’t this the Saul who furiously persecuted those in Jerusalem who called on the name of Jesus? Didn’t he come here with permission from the high priest to drag them off and take them as prisoners?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Saul’s power increased greatly as he became more and more proficient in proving that Jesus was the anointed Messiah. Saul remained there for several days with the disciples, even though it agitated the Jews of Damascus.</verse>
				<verse number="23">As time passed, the Jews plotted together to kill Saul,</verse>
				<verse number="24">but it was revealed to him what they were about to do. They closely guarded the gates of the city and tracked his every movement so they could kill him.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But during the night, some of Saul’s converts helped him escape by lowering him down through an opening in the wall, hiding him in a woven basket.</verse>
				<verse number="26">When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he attempted to introduce himself to the fellowship of the believers, but everyone was afraid of him because they doubted he was a true disciple.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Barnabas came to his defense and brought him before the apostles. Saul shared with them his supernatural experience of seeing the Lord, who spoke with him on the road to Damascus. Barnabas also told them how boldly Saul preached throughout the city in Jesus’ mighty name.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then they accepted him as a brother and he remained with them, joining them wherever they went in Jerusalem, boldly preaching in the power and authority of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="29">He openly debated with some of the Jews who had adopted the Greek culture, yet they were secretly plotting to murder him.</verse>
				<verse number="30">When the believers discovered their scheme, they smuggled him out of the city and took him to Caesarea and then sent him on to Tarsus.</verse>
				<verse number="31">After this, the church all over Judea, Galilee, and Samaria experienced a season of peace. The congregations grew larger and larger, with the believers being empowered and encouraged by the Holy Spirit. They worshiped God in wonder and awe, and walked in the fear of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="32">As Peter was ministering from place to place, he visited God’s devoted ones in the village of Lydda.</verse>
				<verse number="33">He met a man there named Aeneas who had been paralyzed and bedridden for eight years.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus the Anointed One instantly and divinely heals you. Now, get up and make your bed.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">All at once he stood to his feet. And when all the people of Lydda and Sharon saw him, they became believers in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Now, there was a follower of Jesus who lived in Joppa. Her Aramaic name, Tabitha, means “gazelle.” She lived her life doing kind things for others and serving the poor.</verse>
				<verse number="37">But then she became very ill and died. After the disciples prepared her body for burial, they laid her in an upstairs room.</verse>
				<verse number="38">When the believers heard that Peter was nearby in Lydda, they sent two men with an urgent message for him to come without delay.</verse>
				<verse number="39">So Peter went with them back to Joppa, and upon arriving they led him to the upper room. There were many widows standing next to Peter, weeping. One after another showed him the tunics and other garments that Tabitha had made to bless others.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Peter made them all leave the room. Then he knelt down and prayed. Turning to the dead body, he said, “Tabitha, rise up!” At once she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.</verse>
				<verse number="41">He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers and all the widows to come and see that she was alive!</verse>
				<verse number="42">The news spread all over the city of Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Peter remained in Joppa for several more days as a guest at the house of Simon the tanner.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">At that time there was a Roman military officer, Cornelius, who was in charge of one hundred men stationed in Caesarea. He was the captain of the Italian regiment,</verse>
				<verse number="2">a devout man of extraordinary character who worshiped God and prayed regularly, together with all his family. He also had a heart for the poor and gave generously to help them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">One afternoon about three o’clock, he had an open vision and saw the angel of God appear right in front of him, calling out his name, “Cornelius!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Startled, he was overcome with fear by the sight of the angel. He asked, “What do you want, Lord?” The angel said, “All of your prayers and your generosity to the poor have ascended before God as an eternal offering.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now, send some men to Joppa at once. Have them find a man named Simon the Rock,</verse>
				<verse number="6">who is staying as a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">After the angel left, Cornelius called for two of his servants and a trusted, godly soldier who was his personal attaché.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He explained to them everything that had just happened and sent them off to Joppa.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The next day around noon, as Cornelius’ men were approaching Joppa, Peter went up to the flat roof of the house to pray.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He was hungry and wanted to eat, but while lunch was being prepared he fell into a trance and entered into another realm.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As the heavenly realm opened up, he saw something resembling a large linen tablecloth that descended from above, being let down to the earth by its four corners.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As it floated down he saw that it held many kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles, and wild birds.</verse>
				<verse number="13">A voice said to him, “Peter, go and prepare them to be eaten.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Peter replied, “There’s no way I could do that, Lord, for I’ve never eaten anything forbidden or impure according to our Jewish laws.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">The voice spoke again. “Nothing is unclean if God declares it to be clean.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">The vision was repeated three times. Then suddenly the linen sheet was snatched back up into heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Peter was so stunned by the vision that he couldn’t stop wondering about what all it meant. Meanwhile, Cornelius’ men had learned where Peter was staying and at that same moment were standing outside the gate.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They called out to those in the house, “Is this where Simon, the Rock, is staying?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">As Peter was in deep thought, trying to interpret the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Go downstairs now, for three men are looking for you. Don’t hesitate to go with them, because I have sent them.”</verse>
				<verse number="20"></verse>
				<verse number="21">Peter went downstairs to the men and said, “I believe I’m the one you’re looking for. What brings you here?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">They answered, “We serve Cornelius, a Roman military captain, who sent us to find you. He is a devout man of the highest integrity who worships God and is respected throughout the Jewish community. He was divinely instructed through the appearance of an angel to summon you to his home and to listen to the message that you would bring him.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Peter invited them to stay for the night as his guests. The next morning they departed, accompanied by some of the believers from Joppa.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The next day they arrived in Caesarea, where Cornelius was waiting anxiously for them and had gathered together all of his relatives and close friends.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The moment Peter walked in the door, Cornelius fell at his feet to worship him.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But Peter pulled him to his feet and said, “Stand up, for I’m only a man and no different from you.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">They talked together and then went inside, where Peter found a large gathering waiting to hear his words.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Peter said to them, “You all know that it is against the Jewish laws for me to associate with or even visit the home of one who is not a Jew. Yet God has shown me that I should never view anyone as inferior or ritually unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So when you sent for me, I came without objection. Now, may I ask why you sent for me?”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Cornelius replied, “Four days ago I was fasting and praying here in my home at this very hour, three o’clock in the afternoon, when a man in glistening clothing suddenly appeared in front of my eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="31">He said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayers. Your generosity to the poor has been recorded and remembered in God’s presence.</verse>
				<verse number="32">However, you must send for a man named Simon, the Rock, who is staying in Joppa as a guest of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.’</verse>
				<verse number="33">So I immediately sent my men to bring you here—and you were kind enough to come. And now, here we are, all of us in God’s presence, anxious to hear the message that God has put into your heart to share with us.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Peter said, “Now I know for certain that God doesn’t show favoritism with people but treats everyone on the same basis.</verse>
				<verse number="35">It makes no difference what race of people one belongs to. If they show deep reverence for God, and are committed to doing what’s right, they are acceptable before him.</verse>
				<verse number="36">God sent his word to the Jewish people first, announcing the wonderful news of hope and peace through Jesus, the Anointed One, the Lord of all.</verse>
				<verse number="37">You are well aware of all that began in Galilee and spread throughout the land of Israel immediately after John preached his message of baptism.</verse>
				<verse number="38">“Jesus of Nazareth was anointed by God with the Holy Spirit and with great power. He did wonderful things for others and divinely healed all who were under the tyranny of the devil, for God had anointed him.</verse>
				<verse number="39">We apostles were eyewitnesses to all the miracles that he performed throughout the land of Israel. Finally, in Jerusalem, he was crucified on a cross,</verse>
				<verse number="40">but God raised him from the dead three days later, allowing him to be seen openly.</verse>
				<verse number="41">He didn’t appear to everyone, but he appeared to us, his chosen witnesses. He actually ate and drank with us after he rose from the dead!</verse>
				<verse number="42">“Jesus ordered us to preach and warn the people that God had appointed him to be the judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="43">And not only us, but all of the prophets agree in their writings that everyone who believes in him receives complete forgiveness of sins through the power of his name.”</verse>
				<verse number="44">While Peter was speaking, the Holy Spirit cascaded over all those listening to his message.</verse>
				<verse number="45">The Jewish brothers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on people who weren’t Jews,</verse>
				<verse number="46">for they heard them speaking in supernaturally given languages and passionately praising God.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Peter said, “How could anyone object to these people being baptized? For they have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">So he instructed them to be baptized in the power of the name of Jesus, the Anointed One. After their baptism, they asked Peter to stay with them for a few more days.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">The news traveled fast and soon reached the apostles and the believers living in Judea that non-Jewish people were also receiving God’s message of new life.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When Peter finally arrived in Jerusalem, the Jewish believers called him to task, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Why did you stay in the home of people who aren’t Jewish? You even ate your meals with them!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Peter explained what had happened, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="5">“One day when I was in the city of Joppa, while I was praying I fell into an ecstatic trance and I went into another realm. I saw in a vision something like a linen tablecloth descending out of heaven, being let down by its four corners, and it got close to me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">As I examined it I saw many four-footed animals, wild animals, reptiles, and wild birds.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then I heard a voice say to me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat them.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">“I said, ‘I can’t do that, Lord! For I’ve never eaten anything that is forbidden or impure according to our Jewish laws.’</verse>
				<verse number="9">“The voice spoke to me again, saying, ‘Nothing is unclean if God declares it to be clean.’</verse>
				<verse number="10">“The vision repeated itself three times. Then suddenly the linen sheet was snatched back up into heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="11">At that moment three men from Caesarea, who had been sent for me, approached the house where I was staying.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The Spirit told me to accompany them with no questions asked. These six brothers here with me made the trip, and we entered into the home of the man who had sent for me.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He shared with us about the angel who appeared to him and told him to send messengers to Joppa to find Simon, the Rock. The angel had told him,</verse>
				<verse number="14">‘He will tell you and your family the message of how you can be saved!’</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Shortly after I began to speak, the Holy Spirit was poured out upon them, just like what happened to us at the beginning.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And I remembered the words the Lord had told us: ‘John immersed you in water, but you will be immersed in the Holy Spirit.’</verse>
				<verse number="17">So I concluded that if God is pleased to give them the same gift of the Holy Spirit that he gave us after they believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who am I to stand in the way of God?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">When they heard this, their objections were put to rest and they all glorified God, saying, “Look what God has done! He’s giving the gift of repentance that leads to life to people who aren’t even Jews.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Because of the persecution triggered by Stephen’s death in Jerusalem, many of the believers were scattered. Some reached as far as the coast of Lebanon, the island of Cyprus, and Antioch of Syria, but they were still only preaching the word to Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="20">However, some of the believers from Cyprus and Cyrene, who had come to Antioch in Syria, preached to the non-Jews living there, proclaiming the message of salvation in the Lord Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The mighty power of the Lord was with them as they ministered, and a large number of people believed and turned their hearts to the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="22">News of what was happening in Antioch reached the church of Jerusalem, so the apostles sent Barnabas to Antioch as their emissary.</verse>
				<verse number="23">When he got there and witnessed for himself God’s marvelous grace, he was enthused and overjoyed. He encouraged the believers to remain faithful and cling to the Lord with passionate hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Barnabas was a good man, full of the Spirit of holiness, and he exuded a life of faith. Because of his ministry even more crowds of people were brought to the Lord!</verse>
				<verse number="25">Barnabas left for Tarsus to find Saul and bring him back to Antioch.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Together Saul and Barnabas ministered there for a full year, equipping the growing church and teaching the vast number of new converts. It was in Antioch that the followers of Jesus were first revealed as “anointed ones.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">At that time there were prophets in the church of Jerusalem, and some of them came to Antioch.</verse>
				<verse number="28">One of them, named Agabus, stood up in one of the meetings and prophesied by the Holy Spirit that a severe famine was about to come over Israel. (This prophecy was fulfilled during the reign of Claudius Caesar.)</verse>
				<verse number="29">So they determined that each believer, according to his or her ability, would give an offering to send as relief to the brothers living in Judea.</verse>
				<verse number="30">They set aside the gifts and entrusted the funds to Barnabas and Saul to take to the elders of the church in Jerusalem.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">During this period King Herod incited persecution against the church, causing great harm to the believers.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He even had the apostle Jacob, John’s brother, beheaded.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When Herod realized how much this pleased the Jewish leaders, he had Peter arrested and thrown into prison during the Feast of Passover. Sixteen soldiers were assigned to guard him until Herod could bring him to public trial, immediately after the Passover celebrations were over.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">The church went into a season of intense intercession, asking God to free him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The night before Herod planned to bring him to trial, he made sure that Peter was securely bound with two chains. Peter was sound asleep between two soldiers, with additional guards stationed outside his cell door,</verse>
				<verse number="7">when all at once an angel of the Lord appeared, filling his prison cell with a brilliant light. The angel struck Peter on the side to awaken him and said, “Hurry up! Let’s go!” Instantly the chains fell off his wrists.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The angel told him, “Get dressed. Put on your sandals, bring your cloak, and follow me.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Peter quickly left the cell and followed the angel, even though he thought it was only a dream or a vision, for it seemed unreal—he couldn’t believe it was really happening!</verse>
				<verse number="10">They walked unseen past the first guard post and then the second before coming to the iron gate that leads to the city—and the gate swung open all by itself right in front of them! They went out into the city and were walking down a narrow street when all of a sudden the angel disappeared.</verse>
				<verse number="11">That’s when Peter realized that he wasn’t having a dream! He said to himself, “This is really happening! The Lord sent his angel to rescue me from the clutches of Herod and from what the Jewish leaders planned to do to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">When he realized this, he decided to go to the home of Mary and her son John Mark. The house was filled with people praying.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When he knocked on the door to the courtyard, a young servant girl named Rose got up to see who it was.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so excited that she forgot to open the door, but ran back inside the house to announce, “Peter is standing outside!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Are you crazy?” they said to her. But when she kept insisting, they answered, “Well, it must be his angel.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Meanwhile, Peter was still outside, knocking on the door. When they finally opened it, they were shocked to find Peter standing there.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He signaled for them to be quiet as he shared with them the miraculous way the Lord brought him out of prison. Before he left he said, “Make sure you let Jacob and all of the other believers know what has happened.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">At the first sign of daylight, the prison guards were in a tremendous uproar because of Peter’s disappearance. Herod ordered a thorough search for him, but no one could find him.</verse>
				<verse number="19">After he interrogated the guards, he ordered them executed. Then Herod left the province of Judea for Caesarea and stayed there for a period of time.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now, during those days, Herod was engaged in a violent dispute with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they sent a united delegation to Caesarea to appeal to him and reconcile their differences with the king, for Herod controlled their food supply. First they enlisted the support of his trusted personal assistant, Blastus, who secured them an appointment with the king.</verse>
				<verse number="21">On the chosen day, Herod came before them, arrayed in his regal robes. Sitting on his elevated throne, he delivered a stirring public address to the people.</verse>
				<verse number="22">At its conclusion the people gave him a round of applause. The crowd shouted, “These are the words of a god, not a man!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Immediately, an angel of the Lord struck Herod with a sickness, an infestation of worms, because he accepted the people’s worship and didn’t give the glory to God, and he died.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But the hope of God’s kingdom kept spreading and multiplying everywhere!</verse>
				<verse number="25">After Barnabas and Saul had delivered the charitable offering for relief, they left Jerusalem, bringing with them a disciple named Mark (who was also known as John).</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">In the church at Antioch there were a number of prophets and teachers of the Word, including Barnabas, Simeon from Niger, Lucius the Libyan, Manean (the childhood companion of King Herod Antipas), and Saul.</verse>
				<verse number="2">While they were worshiping as priests before the Lord in prayer and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “I have called Barnabas and Saul to do an important work for me. Now, release them to go and fulfill it.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So after they had fasted and prayed, they laid hands on them and sent them off.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Saul and Barnabas, and their assistant Mark (known as John), were directed by the Holy Spirit to go to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. When they arrived at Salamis, they went to the synagogues and declared the Word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="5"></verse>
				<verse number="6">From there they crossed the island as far as Paphos, where they encountered a Jewish false prophet, a sorcerer named Elymas, who also went by the name of “son of Jesus.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">He had gained influence as the spiritual advisor to the regional governor, Sergius Paulus, considered by many to be a wise and intelligent leader. The governor requested a meeting with Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the message of God’s word.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But Elymas, whose name means “sorcerer,” stood up against them and tried to prevent the governor from believing their message.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Saul, also known as Paul, stared into his eyes and rebuked him. Filled with the Holy Spirit, he said,</verse>
				<verse number="10">“You son of the devil! You are full of every form of fraud and deceit and an enemy of all that is right. When will you stop perverting the truth of God into lies?</verse>
				<verse number="11">At this very moment the hand of God’s judgment comes down upon you and you will be blind—so blind you won’t even be able to see the light of the sun.” As Paul spoke these words, a shadowy mist and darkness came over the sorcerer, leaving him blind and groping about, begging someone to lead him around by the hand.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When the governor witnessed this, he believed and was awestruck by the power of the message of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Paul and his companions sailed from the Cyprus port of Paphos to Perga in southern Turkey. John left them there and returned to Jerusalem</verse>
				<verse number="14">as they journeyed on to the city of Antioch in the region of Pisidia. On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and took their seats.</verse>
				<verse number="15">After the reading from the scrolls of the books of Moses and the prophets, the leader of the meeting sent Paul and Barnabas a message, saying, “Brothers, do you have a word of encouragement to share with us? If so, please feel free to give it.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Paul stood and motioned that he had something to say. He said, “Listen, all of you Jews and non-Jews who worship God.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The God of Israel divinely chose our ancestors to be his people. While they were enslaved in Egypt, he made them great, both in numbers and in strength, until he unveiled his mighty power and led them out of bondage.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For nearly forty years, he nourished them in the wilderness.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He was the one who destroyed the seven nations inhabiting the land of Canaan and afterward gave the land to his people as their inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="20">This took about four hundred and fifty years. “Then God raised up deliverers for the people until the time of the prophet Samuel.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The people craved for a king, so God gave them one from the tribe of Benjamin: Saul, the son of Kish, who ruled for forty years.</verse>
				<verse number="22">After removing him, God raised up David to be king, for God said of him, ‘I have found in David, son of Jesse, a man who always pursues my heart and will accomplish all that I have destined him to do.’</verse>
				<verse number="23">“From David’s lineage God brought Israel a Savior, just as he promised.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So before Jesus appeared, John preached the message of a baptism of repentance to prepare all of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="25">As John was about to finish his mission, he said repeatedly, ‘If you think that I am the one to come, you’re mistaken. He will come after me, and I don’t even deserve to stoop down and untie his sandals!’</verse>
				<verse number="26">“Fellow Jews, Abraham’s descendants, and all those among you who worship and reverence God, this message of life has been sent for us all to hear.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But the people of Jerusalem and their leaders didn’t realize who he was, nor did they understand the prophecies written of him. Yet they fulfilled those very prophecies, which they read week after week in their meetings, by condemning him to death.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Even though they could come up with no legal grounds for the death sentence, they pleaded with Pilate to have him executed.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And they did to him all that was prophesied they would do. “Then they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But God raised him from the dead!</verse>
				<verse number="31">And for many days afterward he appeared on numerous occasions to his disciples who knew him well and had followed him from Galilee to Jerusalem. Those disciples are now his witnesses, telling the people the truth about him.</verse>
				<verse number="32">“So here we are to share with you some wonderful news! The promise God made to our forefathers</verse>
				<verse number="33">has now been fulfilled for us, their children. For God has raised Jesus from the dead, as it says in Psalms: ‘Today I reveal you as my Son, and I as your Father.’</verse>
				<verse number="34">“God had promised to not let him decay in the tomb or face destruction again, so God raised him from the dead. He gave this promise in the Psalms: ‘I will give to you what I gave to David: Faithful mercies that you can trust.’</verse>
				<verse number="35">“He explains it further in another Psalm: ‘You will not allow your holy one to experience bodily decay.’</verse>
				<verse number="36">“This cannot be a reference to David, for after he passionately served God’s purpose for his generation, he died. He was buried with his ancestors and his body experienced decay.</verse>
				<verse number="37">But the one whom God raised from the dead has never experienced corruption in any form.</verse>
				<verse number="38">“So listen, friends! Through this Jesus, the forgiveness of sins is offered to you.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Everyone who believes in him is set free from sin and guilt—something the law of Moses had no power to do.</verse>
				<verse number="40">So be very careful that what the prophets warned about does not happen to you:</verse>
				<verse number="41">‘Be amazed and in agony, you scoffers! For in your day I will do something so wonderful that when I perform mighty deeds among you, you won’t even believe that it was I who did it!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="42">As Paul and Barnabas started to leave, the people pleaded with them to share more about these things on the next Sabbath day.</verse>
				<verse number="43">When the meeting had finally broken up, many of those in attendance, both Jews and converts to Judaism, tagged along with Paul and Barnabas, who continued to persuade them to go deeper in their understanding of God’s grace.</verse>
				<verse number="44">The following week, nearly everyone in the city gathered to hear the word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="45">When the Jewish leaders saw the size of the crowds, vicious jealousy filled their hearts and they rose up to oppose what Paul was teaching. They insulted him and argued with him over everything he said.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Yet Paul and Barnabas did not back down. Filled with courage, they boldly replied, “We were compelled to bring God’s message first to you Jews. But seeing you’ve rejected this message and refuse to embrace eternal life, we will focus instead on the nations and offer it to them.</verse>
				<verse number="47">This will fulfill what the Lord has commanded us: ‘I have destined you to become a beacon light for the nations and release salvation to the ends of the earth!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="48">When the non-Jewish people in the crowd heard these words, they were thrilled and they honored the word of the Lord. All who believed that they were destined to experience eternal life received the message.</verse>
				<verse number="49">God’s word spread like wildfire throughout the entire region.</verse>
				<verse number="50">The Jewish leaders stirred up a violent mob against Paul and Barnabas, including many prominent and wealthy people of the city. They persecuted them and ran them out of town.</verse>
				<verse number="51">As they left, they shook the dust off their feet as a sign of protest against them, and they went on to the city of Iconium.</verse>
				<verse number="52">They left the new converts in Antioch overflowing with the joy of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">When Paul and Barnabas arrived at Iconium, the same thing happened there. They went, as they always did, to the synagogue and preached to the people with such power that a large crowd of both Jews and non-Jews believed.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Some of the Jews refused to believe, and they began to poison the minds of the non-Jews to discredit the believers.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yet Paul and Barnabas stayed there for a long time, preaching boldly and fearlessly about the Lord. Many trusted in the Lord, for he backed up his message of grace with miracles, signs, and wonders performed by the apostles.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The people of the city were split over the issue. Some sided with the apostles, and others with the Jews who refused to believe.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Eventually, all the opposition factions came together, with their leaders devising a plot to harm Paul and Barnabas and stone them to death.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When the apostles learned about this, they escaped to the region of Lyconia, to the cities of Lystra and Derbe and the nearby villages.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And they continued to preach the hope of the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="8">In Lystra, Paul and Barnabas encountered a man who from birth had never walked, for he was crippled in his feet.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He listened carefully to Paul as he preached. All of a sudden, Paul discerned that this man had faith in his heart to be healed.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So he shouted, “You! In the name of our Lord Jesus, stand up on your feet!” The man instantly jumped to his feet, stood for the first time in his life, and walked!</verse>
				<verse number="11">When the crowds saw the miracle Paul had done, they shouted in their own language, “The gods have come down to us as men!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">They addressed Barnabas as “Zeus” and Paul as “Hermes,” because he was the spokesman.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now, outside of the city stood the temple of Zeus. The priest of the temple, in order to honor Paul and Barnabas, brought bulls with wreaths of flowers draped on them to the gates of the courtyard where they were staying. The crowds clamored to offer them as sacrifices to the apostles. He even brought flower wreaths as crowns to place on their heads.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When the apostles understood what was happening, they were mortified and tore their clothes as a sign of dismay. They rushed into the crowd and shouted,</verse>
				<verse number="15">“People, what are you doing? We’re only weak human beings like everyone else. This is why we’ve come to tell you the good news, so that you would turn away from these worthless myths and turn to the living God. He is the Creator of all things: the earth, the heavens, the sea, and everything they contain.</verse>
				<verse number="16">In previous generations he allowed the nations to pursue their own ways,</verse>
				<verse number="17">yet he has never left himself without clear evidence of his goodness. For he blesses us with rain from heaven and seasons of fruitful harvests, and he nourishes us with food to meet our needs. He satisfies our lives, and euphoria fills our hearts.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Even after saying these things, they were barely able to restrain the people from offering sacrifices to them.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Some of the Jews who had opposed Paul and Barnabas in Antioch and Iconium arrived and stirred up the crowd against them. They stoned Paul and dragged his body outside the city and left him for dead.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When the believers encircled Paul’s body, he miraculously stood up! Paul stood and immediately went back into the city. The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.</verse>
				<verse number="21">After preaching the wonderful news of the gospel there and winning a large number of followers to Jesus, they retraced their steps and revisited Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.</verse>
				<verse number="22">At each place they went, they strengthened the lives of the believers and encouraged them to go deeper in their faith. And they taught them, “It is necessary for us to enter into the realm of God’s kingdom, because that’s the only way we will endure our many trials and persecutions.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Paul and Barnabas ordained leaders, known as elders, from among the congregations in every church they visited. After prayer and fasting, they publicly committed them into the care and protection of the Lord of their faith.</verse>
				<verse number="24">After passing through different regions of central Turkey,</verse>
				<verse number="25">they went to the city of Perga, preaching the life-giving message of the Lord. Afterward they journeyed down to the coast at Antalya,</verse>
				<verse number="26">and from there they sailed back to Antioch. With their mission complete, they returned to the church where they had originally been sent out as missionaries, for it was in Antioch where they had been handed over to God’s powerful grace.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When they arrived in Antioch, they gathered the church together and shared with them all of the wonderful works God had done through them and how God had opened the door of faith for the non-Jews to enter in.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Afterward, Paul and Barnabas stayed there for a long time in fellowship with the believers.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">While Paul and Barnabas were in Antioch, some false teachers came from Judea to trouble the believers. They taught, “Unless you are circumcised, as the law of Moses requires, you cannot be saved.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">This sparked a fierce argument between the false teachers and Paul and Barnabas. So the church appointed a delegation of believers, including Paul and Barnabas, to go to Jerusalem to meet with the apostles and elders of the church and resolve this issue.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So the church sent them on their way. As they passed through Lebanon and Samaria, they stopped to share with the believers how God was converting many from among the non-Jewish people. Hearing this report brought great joy to all the churches.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When they finally arrived in Jerusalem, Paul and Barnabas were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders. They explained to them everything God had done among them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But some of the believers who were of the religious group called “separated ones” were insistent, saying, “We must continue the custom of circumcision and require that the people keep the law of Moses.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So the apostles and elders met privately to discuss the matter further.</verse>
				<verse number="7">After a lengthy debate, Peter rose to his feet and said to them, “Brothers, you know how God has chosen me from the beginning to preach the wonderful news of the gospel to the non-Jewish nations.</verse>
				<verse number="8">God, who knows the hearts of every person, confirmed this when he gave them the Holy Spirit, just like he has given the Spirit to us.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So now, not one thing separates us as Jews and gentiles, for when they believe he makes their hearts pure.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So why on earth would you now limit God’s grace by placing a yoke of religious duties on the shoulders of the believers that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear?</verse>
				<verse number="11">Don’t you believe that we are introduced to eternal life through the grace of our Lord Jesus—the same grace that has brought these people new life?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Everyone became silent and listened carefully as Paul and Barnabas shared with the council at length about the signs and wonders and miracles God had worked through them while ministering to the non-Jewish people.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When they had finished, Jacob took the floor and said, “Ladies and gentlemen, listen.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Peter has explained thoroughly that God has determined to win a people for himself from among the non-Jewish nations.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And the prophet’s words are fulfilled:</verse>
				<verse number="16">‘After these things I will return to you and raise up the tabernacle of David that has fallen into ruin. I will restore and rebuild what David experienced</verse>
				<verse number="17">so that all of humanity will be able to encounter the Lord including the gentiles whom I have called to be my very own,’ says the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="18">‘For I have made known my works from eternity!’</verse>
				<verse number="19">“So, in my judgment, we should not add any unnecessary burden upon the non-Jewish converts who are turning to God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">We will go to them as apostles and teach them to be set free from offering sacrifices to idols, sexual immorality, and eating anything strangled or with any blood.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For many generations these words of Moses have been proclaimed every Sabbath day in the synagogues.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">The apostles and elders and the church of Jerusalem chose delegates to go to Antioch in Syria. They chose Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, both leaders in the church, to accompany Paul and Barnabas.</verse>
				<verse number="23">They sent with them this letter: “Greetings from the apostles and pastors, and from your fellow believers—to our non-Jewish brothers and sisters living in Antioch in Syria and the nearby regions.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“We are aware that some have come to you from the church of Jerusalem. These men were not sent by us, but came with false teachings that have brought confusion and division, telling you to keep the law and be circumcised—things we never commanded them to teach.</verse>
				<verse number="25">So after deliberation, we’re sending you our beloved brothers Paul and Barnabas, who have risked their lives for the glory of the name of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One. They are accompanied by Judas and Silas, whom we have unanimously chosen to send as our representatives to you. They will validate all that we’re wanting to share with you.</verse>
				<verse number="26"></verse>
				<verse number="27"></verse>
				<verse number="28">“For it pleases the Holy Spirit and us that we not place any unnecessary burden on you, except for the following restrictions:</verse>
				<verse number="29">Stay away from anything sacrificed to a pagan idol, from eating what is strangled or with any blood, and from any form of sexual immorality. You will be beautiful believers if you keep your souls from these things, and you will be true and faithful to our Lord Jesus. May God bless you!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">They sent the four men off for Antioch, and after gathering the regional church together, they delivered the letter.</verse>
				<verse number="31">When the people heard the letter read out loud, they were overjoyed and delighted by its encouraging message.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then Judas and Silas, who were both prophets, spoke to them affirming words that strengthened the believers.</verse>
				<verse number="33">After the four men spent some time there, the church sent them off in peace to return to the apostles in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="34">However, only Judas departed; Paul, Barnabas, and Silas stayed in Antioch, where they and many others preached and taught the wonderful message of the word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="35"></verse>
				<verse number="36">After some days, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s travel to the regions where we’ve preached the word of God and see how the believers are getting along.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Barnabas wished to take Mark (also known as John) along with them,</verse>
				<verse number="38">but Paul disagreed. He didn’t think it was proper to take the one who had deserted them in south-central Turkey, leaving them to do their missionary work without him.</verse>
				<verse number="39">It became a heated argument between them, a disagreement so sharp that they parted from each other. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
				<verse number="40">And Paul chose Silas as his partner. After the believers prayed for them, asking for the Lord’s favor on their ministry, they left</verse>
				<verse number="41">for Syria and southeast Turkey. Every place they went, they left the church stronger and more encouraged than before.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">Paul and Silas came to the city of Derbe and then went on to Lystra, the hometown of a believer named Timothy. His mother was a Jewish follower of Jesus, but his father was not a Jew.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Timothy was well known and highly respected among all the believers of Lystra and Iconium.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Paul recognized God’s favor on Timothy’s life and wanted him to accompany them in ministry, but Paul had Timothy circumcised first because of the significant Jewish community living in the region, and everyone knew that Timothy’s father wasn’t a Jew.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They went out together as missionaries, traveling to different cities where they preached and informed the churches of the decrees of the apostolic council of Jerusalem for the non-Jewish converts to observe.</verse>
				<verse number="5">All the churches were growing daily and were encouraged and strengthened in their faith.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The Holy Spirit had forbidden Paul and his partners to preach the word in the southwestern provinces of Turkey, so they ministered throughout the region of central and west-central Turkey.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When they got as far west as the borders of Mysia, they repeatedly attempted to go north into the province of Bithynia, but again the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to enter.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So instead they went right on through the province of Mysia to the seaport of Troas.</verse>
				<verse number="9">While staying there Paul experienced a supernatural, ecstatic vision during the night. A man from Macedonia appeared before him, pleading with him, “You must come across the sea to Macedonia and help us!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">After Paul had this vision, we immediately prepared to cross over to Macedonia, convinced that God himself was calling us to go and preach the wonderful news of the gospel to them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">From Troas we sailed a straight course to the island of Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Finally we reached Philippi, a major city in the Roman colony of Macedonia, and we remained there for a number of days.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When the Sabbath day came, we went outside the gates of the city to the nearby river, for there appeared to be a house of prayer and worship there. Sitting on the riverbank we struck up a conversation with some of the women who had gathered there.</verse>
				<verse number="14">One of them was Lydia, a businesswoman from the city of Thyatira who was a dealer of exquisite purple cloth and a Jewish convert. While Paul shared the good news with her, God opened her heart to receive Paul’s message.</verse>
				<verse number="15">She devoted herself to the Lord, and we baptized her and her entire family. Afterward she urged us to stay in her home, saying, “Since I am now a believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house.” So we were persuaded to stay there.</verse>
				<verse number="16">One day, as we were going to the house of prayer, we encountered a young slave girl who had an evil spirit of divination, the spirit of Python. She had earned great profits for her owners by being a fortune-teller.</verse>
				<verse number="17">She kept following us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Great High God, and they’re telling us how to be saved!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Day after day she continued to do this, until Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit indwelling her, “I command you in the name of Jesus, the Anointed One, to come out of her, now!” At that very moment, the spirit came out of her!</verse>
				<verse number="19">When her owners realized that their potential of making profit had vanished, they forcefully seized Paul and Silas and dragged them off to the city square to face the authorities.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When they appeared before the Roman soldiers and magistrates, the slave owners leveled accusations against them, saying, “These Jews are troublemakers. They’re throwing our city into confusion.</verse>
				<verse number="21">They’re pushing their Jewish religion down our throats. It’s wrong and unlawful for them to promote these Jewish ways, for we are Romans living in a Roman colony.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">A great crowd gathered, and all the people joined in to come against them. The Roman officials ordered that Paul and Silas be stripped of their garments and beaten with rods on their bare backs.</verse>
				<verse number="23">After they were severely beaten, they were thrown into prison and the jailer was commanded to guard them securely.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So the jailer placed them in the innermost cell of the prison and had their feet bound and chained.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Paul and Silas, undaunted, prayed in the middle of the night and sang songs of praise to God, while all the other prisoners listened to their worship.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Suddenly, a great earthquake shook the foundations of the prison. All at once every prison door flung open and the chains of all the prisoners came loose.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Startled, the jailer awoke and saw every cell door standing open. Assuming that all the prisoners had escaped, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself</verse>
				<verse number="28">when Paul shouted in the darkness, “Stop! Don’t hurt yourself. We’re all still here.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">The jailer called for a light. When he saw that they were still in their cells, he rushed in and fell trembling at their feet.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then he led Paul and Silas outside and asked, “What must I do to be saved?”</verse>
				<verse number="31">They answered, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved—you and all your family.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then they prophesied the word of the Lord over him and all his family.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Even though the hour was late, he washed their wounds. Then he and all his family were baptized. He took Paul and Silas into his home and set them at his table and fed them.</verse>
				<verse number="34">The jailer and all his family were filled with joy in their newfound faith in God.</verse>
				<verse number="35">At daybreak, the magistrates sent officers to the prison with orders to tell the jailer, “Let those two men go.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">The jailer informed Paul and Silas, “The magistrates have sent orders to release you. So you’re free to go now.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">But Paul told the officers, “Look, they had us beaten in public, without a fair trial—and we are Roman citizens. Do you think we’re just going to quietly walk away after they threw us in prison and violated all of our rights? Absolutely not! You go back and tell the magistrates that they need to come down here themselves and escort us out!”</verse>
				<verse number="38">When the officers went back and reported what Paul and Silas had told them, the magistrates were frightened, especially upon hearing that they had beaten two Roman citizens without due process.</verse>
				<verse number="39">So they went to the prison and apologized to Paul and Silas, begging them repeatedly, saying, “Please leave our city.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">So Paul and Silas left the prison and went back to Lydia’s house, where they met with the believers and comforted and encouraged them before departing.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">After passing through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas arrived at Thessalonica.</verse>
				<verse number="2">As they customarily did, they went to the synagogue to speak to the Jews from the Torah scrolls. For three weeks</verse>
				<verse number="3">Paul challenged them by explaining the truth and proving to them the reality of the gospel—that the Messiah had to suffer and die, then rise again from among the dead. He made it clear to them, saying, “I come to announce to you that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Messiah!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Some of the Jews were convinced that their message was true, so they joined Paul and Silas, along with quite a few prominent women and a large number of Greeks who worshiped God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But many of the Jews were motivated by bitter jealousy and formed a large mob out of the troublemakers, unsavory characters, and street gangs to incite a riot. They set out to attack Jason’s house, for he had welcomed the apostles into his home. The mob was after Paul and Silas and sought to take them by force and bring them out to the people.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When they couldn’t find them, they took Jason instead, along with some of the brothers in his house church, and dragged them before the city council. Along the way they screamed out, “Those troublemakers who have turned the world upside down have come here to our city.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And now Jason and these men have welcomed them as guests. They’re traitors to Caesar, teaching that there is another king named Jesus.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Their angry shouts stirred up the crowds and troubled the city and all its officials.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So when Paul and Silas came before the leaders of the city, they refused to let them go until Jason and his men posted bail.</verse>
				<verse number="10">That night the believers sent Paul and Silas off to the city of Berea, where they once again went into the synagogue.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They found that the Jews of Berea were of more noble character and much more open minded than those of Thessalonica. They were hungry to learn and eagerly received the word. Every day they opened the scrolls of Scripture to search and examine them, to verify that what Paul taught them was true.</verse>
				<verse number="12">A large number of Jews became believers in Jesus, along with quite a few influential Greek women and men.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When the news reached the Jews in Thessalonica that Paul was now in Berea, preaching the word of God, the troublemakers went there too and they agitated and stirred up the crowds against him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The fellow believers helped Paul slip away to the coast of the Aegean Sea, while Silas and Timothy remained in Berea.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Those who accompanied Paul sailed with him as far as Athens. Then Paul sent them back to Berea with instructions for Silas and Timothy to hurry and join him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was deeply troubled when he realized that the entire city was full of idols.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He argued the claims of the gospel with the Jews in their synagogue, and with those who were worshipers of God, and every day he preached in the public square to whomever would listen.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Philosophers of the teachings of Epicurus, and others called Stoics, debated with Paul. When they heard him speak about Jesus and his resurrection, they said, “What strange ideas is this babbler trying to present?” Others said, “He’s peddling some kind of foreign religion.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So they brought him for a public dialogue before the leadership council of Athens, known as the Areopagus. “Tell us,” they said, “about this new teaching that you’re bringing to our city.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You’re presenting strange and astonishing things to our ears, and we want to know what it all means.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Now, it was the favorite pastime of the Athenians and visitors to Athens to discuss the newest ideas and philosophies.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So Paul stood in the middle of the leadership council and said, “Respected leaders of Athens, it is clear to me how extravagant you are in your worship of idols.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For as I walked through your city, I was captivated by the many shrines and objects of your worship. I even found an inscription on one altar that read, ‘To the Unknown God.’ I have come to introduce to you this God whom you worship without even knowing anything about him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“The true God is the Creator of all things. He is the owner and Lord of the heavenly realm and the earthly realm, and he doesn’t live in man-made temples.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He supplies life and breath and all things to every living being. He doesn’t lack a thing that we mortals could supply for him, for he has all things and everything he needs.</verse>
				<verse number="26">From one man, Adam, he made every man and woman and every race of humanity, and he spread us over all the earth. He sets the boundaries of people and nations, determining their appointed times in history.</verse>
				<verse number="27">He has done this so that every person would long for God, feel their way to him, and find him—for he is the God who is easy to discover!</verse>
				<verse number="28">It is through him that we live and function and have our identity; just as your own poets have said, ‘Our lineage comes from him.’</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Since our lineage can be traced back to God, how could we even think that the divine image could be compared to something made of gold, silver, or stone, sculpted by man’s artwork and clever imagination?</verse>
				<verse number="30">“In the past God tolerated our ignorance of these things, but now the time of deception has passed away. He commands us all to repent and turn to God.</verse>
				<verse number="31">For the appointed day has risen, in which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man he has designated. And the proof given to the world that God has chosen this man is this: he resurrected him from among the dead!”</verse>
				<verse number="32">The moment they heard Paul bring up the topic of resurrection, some of them ridiculed him, then got up and left. But others said, “We want to hear you again later about these things.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">So Paul left the meeting.</verse>
				<verse number="34">But there were some who believed the message and joined him from that day forward. Among them were Dionysius, a judge on the leadership council, and a woman named Damaris.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">When Paul left Athens he traveled to Corinth,</verse>
				<verse number="2">where he met a Jewish man named Aquila, who was originally from northeastern Turkey. He and his wife, Priscilla, had recently emigrated from Italy to Corinth because Emperor Claudius had expelled all the Jews from Rome.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Since Paul and Aquila were both tentmakers by trade, Paul moved in with them and they became business partners.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Every Sabbath day Paul spoke openly in the synagogue, to both Jews and non-Jews, attempting to persuade them to believe the message of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When Silas and Timothy finally arrived from Macedonia, Paul spent all his time preaching the word of God, trying to convince the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When they viciously slandered him and hurled abuse on him, he symbolically shook the dust off his clothes in protest against them. He said to them, “Have it your way then! I am guiltless as to your fate, for the blood-guilt of your actions will be on your own heads, and from now on I will preach to the non-Jews.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Leaving the synagogue, Paul went to the home of Titus, a convert to Judaism, for he and his family attended the Jewish meetings and they had all become believers in Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire family, and many of the Corinthians who heard what had happened believed in the Lord and were baptized.</verse>
				<verse number="9">One night, the Lord spoke to Paul in a supernatural vision and said, “Don’t ever be afraid. Speak the words that I give you and don’t be intimidated,</verse>
				<verse number="10">because I am with you. No one will be able to hurt you, for there are many in this city whom I call my own.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">For the next year and a half, Paul stayed in Corinth, faithfully teaching the word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now, at that time, Gallio was the regional governor who ruled over the Roman province of Achaia, and the Jews turned against Paul and came together to seize him and bring him publicly before the governor’s court.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They accused him before Gallio, saying, “This man is creating a disturbance by persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to our laws.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Just as Paul was about to speak in his defense, Gallio interrupted and said, “Wait! If this involved some major crime or fraud, it would be my responsibility to hear the case.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But this is nothing more than a disagreement among yourselves over semantics and personalities and traditions of your own Jewish laws. Go and settle it yourselves! I refuse to be the judge of these issues.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So Gallio dismissed them from the court.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Immediately the crowd turned on Sosthenes, one of the leaders of the synagogue who sided with Paul. They seized him and beat him up right there in the courtroom! But Gallio showed no concern at all over what was happening.</verse>
				<verse number="18">After remaining in Corinth several more days, Paul finally bid shalom to the believers and sailed away for the coast of Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before they left, Paul had his head shaved at Cenchrea, because he had taken a vow of dedication.</verse>
				<verse number="19">When they reached Ephesus, Paul left Priscilla and Aquila behind, then he went into the synagogue and spoke to the Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="20">They asked him to stay longer, but he refused</verse>
				<verse number="21">and said farewell to them, adding, “I will come back to you, if it is God’s will, after I go to Jerusalem to observe the feast.” Then he set sail from Ephesus for Caesarea.</verse>
				<verse number="22">When he arrived there he traveled on to Jerusalem to visit the church and pray for them, then he left for Antioch.</verse>
				<verse number="23">After spending some time there, Paul continued on through the region of Galatia and Phyrgia in central Turkey. And wherever he went he encouraged and strengthened the believers.</verse>
				<verse number="24">A Jewish man by the name of Apollos arrived in Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria and was recognized as an educated and cultured man. He was powerful in the Scriptures,</verse>
				<verse number="25">had accepted Jesus, and had been taught about the Lord. He was spiritually passionate for Jesus and a convincing teacher, although he only knew about the baptism of John.</verse>
				<verse number="26">He fearlessly preached in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard Apollos’ teachings, they met with him privately and revealed to him the ways of God more completely.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then Apollos, with the encouragement of the believers, went to the province of Achaia. He took a letter of recommendation from the brothers of Ephesus so his ministry would be welcomed in the region. He was a tremendous help to the believers and caused them to increase in grace.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Apollos boldly and publicly confronted the Jews, vigorously debating them, proving undeniably from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.</verse>

				<verse number="1">While Apollos was ministering in Corinth, Paul traveled on through the regions of Turkey until he arrived in Ephesus, where he found a group of twelve followers of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The first thing he asked them was “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?” “No,” they replied. “We’ve not even heard of a holy spirit.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Paul asked, “Then what was the meaning of your baptism?” They responded, “It meant that we would follow John’s teaching.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Paul said, “John’s baptism was for those who were turning from their sins, and he taught you to believe in and follow the one who was coming after him: Jesus the Anointed One.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">When they understood this, they were baptized into the authority of Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And when Paul laid his hands on each of the twelve, the Holy Spirit manifested and they immediately spoke in tongues and prophesied.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">For three months Paul taught openly and fearlessly in the synagogue, arguing persuasively for them to enter into God’s kingdom realm.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But some of them hardened their hearts and stubbornly refused to believe. When they spoke evil of the Way in front of the congregation, Paul withdrew from them and took the believers with him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Every day for over two years, he taught them in the lecture hall of Tyrannus, which resulted in everyone living in the province of Asia, Jews and non-Jews, hearing the prophetic word of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="11">God kept releasing a flow of extraordinary miracles through the hands of Paul.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Because of this, people took Paul’s handkerchiefs and articles of clothing, even pieces of cloth that had touched his skin, laying them on the bodies of the sick, and diseases and demons left them and they were healed.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now, there were seven itinerant Jewish exorcists, sons of Sceva the high priest, who took it upon themselves to use the name and authority of Jesus over those who were demonized. They would say, “We cast you out in the name of the Jesus that Paul preaches!”</verse>
				<verse number="14"></verse>
				<verse number="15">One day, when they said those words, the demon in the man replied, “I know about Jesus, and I recognize Paul, but who do you think you are?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then the demonized man jumped on them and threw them to the ground, beating them mercilessly. He overpowered the seven exorcists until they all ran out of the house naked and badly bruised.</verse>
				<verse number="17">All of the people in Ephesus were awestruck, both Jews and non-Jews, when they heard about what had happened. Great fear fell over the entire city, and the authority of the name of Jesus was exalted.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Many believers publicly confessed their sins and disclosed their secrets.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Large numbers of those who had been practicing magic took all of their books and scrolls of spells and incantations and publicly burned them. When the value of all the books and scrolls was calculated, it all came to several million dollars.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The power of God caused the word to spread, and the people were greatly impacted.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Paul had it in his heart to go to Jerusalem and, on his way there, to revisit the places in Greece where he had ministered. “After that,” he said, “I have to go to Rome also.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">So he sent ahead into Macedonia two of his ministry assistants, Timothy and Erastus, while he remained in western Turkey.</verse>
				<verse number="23">At that time a major disturbance erupted in Ephesus over the people following God’s way.</verse>
				<verse number="24">It began with a wealthy man named Demetrius, who had built a large business and enriched many craftsmen by manufacturing silver shrines for the Greek goddess Artemis.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Demetrius called a meeting of his employees, along with all the various tradespeople of Ephesus, and said, “You know that our prosperous livelihood is being threatened by this Paul, who is persuading crowds of people to turn away from our gods. We make a good living by doing what we do, but everywhere Paul goes, not only here in Ephesus but throughout western Turkey, he convinces people that there’s no such thing as a god made with hands.</verse>
				<verse number="26"></verse>
				<verse number="27">Our businesses are in danger of being discredited. And not only that, but the temple of our great goddess Artemis is being dishonored and seen as worthless. She is the goddess of all of western Turkey and is worshiped in all the world. But if this outrage continues, everyone everywhere will suffer the loss of her magnificent greatness.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">When the people heard this, they were filled with boiling rage. They shouted over and over, “Artemis, the great goddess of the Ephesians!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">The entire city was thrown into chaos as everyone rushed into the stadium together, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia.</verse>
				<verse number="30">When Paul attempted to go in and speak to the massive crowd, the disciples wouldn’t let him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Some of the high-ranking governmental officials of the region, because they loved him, sent Paul an urgent message, saying, “Whatever you do, don’t step foot into that stadium!”</verse>
				<verse number="32">The frenzied crowd shouted out one thing, and others shouted something else, until they were all in mass confusion, with many not even knowing why they were there!</verse>
				<verse number="33">Some of the Jews pushed forward a Jewish man named Alexander to be their spokesman, and different factions of the crowd shouted instructions at him. He stood before the people and motioned for everyone to be quiet so he could be heard.</verse>
				<verse number="34">But when he began to speak, they realized that he was a Jew, so they shouted him down. For nearly two hours they shouted over and over, “Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Eventually the mayor of the city was able to quiet them down. He said, “Fellow citizens! Who in the world doesn’t know that we are devoted to the great temple of Artemis and to her image that fell from Zeus out of heaven?</verse>
				<verse number="36">Since no one can deny it, you should all just be quiet. Calm down and don’t do anything hasty.</verse>
				<verse number="37">For you have brought these men before us who aren’t guilty of any crime. They are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.</verse>
				<verse number="38">So if Demetrius and the men of his trade have a case against someone, the courts are open. They can appear before the judge and press charges.</verse>
				<verse number="39">But if you’re looking for anything further to bring up, it must be argued before the court and settled there, not here.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Don’t you realize we’re putting our city in danger of being accused of a riot by the Roman authorities? There’s no good explanation we can give them for all this commotion!”</verse>
				<verse number="41">After he had said this, he dispersed the crowds and sent them away.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">When the uproar finally died down, Paul gathered the believers and encouraged their hearts. He kissed them, said good-bye, and left for Macedonia.</verse>
				<verse number="2">At every place he passed through, he brought words of great comfort and encouragement to the believers. Then he went on to Greece</verse>
				<verse number="3">and stayed there for three months. Just as Paul was about to sail for Syria, he learned of a plot against him by the Jews, so he decided to return by going through Macedonia.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Seven men accompanied him as far as western Turkey. They were Sopater, son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus from western Turkey.</verse>
				<verse number="5">These men went ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.</verse>
				<verse number="6">As soon as all of the Passover celebrations were over, we sailed from Philippi. After five days we joined the others in Troas, where we stayed another week.</verse>
				<verse number="7">On Sunday we gathered to take communion and to hear Paul preach. Because he was planning to leave the next day, he continued speaking until past midnight.</verse>
				<verse number="8">There were many flickering lights in the upstairs chamber where we were meeting.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Sitting in an open window listening was a young man named Eutychus. As Paul’s sermon dragged on, Eutychus became drowsy and fell into a deep slumber. Sound asleep, he fell three stories to his death below.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Paul went downstairs, bent over the boy, and embraced him. Taking him in his arms, he said to all the people gathered, “Stop your worrying. He’s come back to life!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Paul went back upstairs, served communion, and ate a meal with them. Then he picked back up where he left off and taught until dawn.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Filled with enormous joy, they took the boy home alive and everyone was encouraged.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Continuing our journey, we made our way to the ship and sailed for Assos. Paul had previously arranged to meet us there as he traveled overland by foot.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So he rejoined our team there and we took him aboard and sailed for Mitylene.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The next day we crossed over to Chios, and the following day we arrived at the island of Samos. We stayed at Trogyllium, and on the day after that we reached Miletus.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Paul was in a hurry to arrive in Jerusalem, hoping to make it in time for the Feast of Pentecost, so he decided to bypass Ephesus and not spend any time in that region.</verse>
				<verse number="17">However, from Miletus Paul had sent a message to the elders of the church in Ephesus and asked them to come meet with him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When they arrived, he said to them, “All of you know how I’ve lived and conducted myself while I was with you. From the first day I set foot in western Turkey</verse>
				<verse number="19">I’ve operated in God’s miracle power with great humility and served you with many tears. I’ve endured numerous ordeals because of the plots of the Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You know how I’ve taught you in public meetings and in your homes, and that I’ve not held anything back from you that would help you grow.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I urged both Jews and non-Jews to turn from sin to God and to have faith in our Lord Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And now I am captive to the Holy Spirit to go to Jerusalem, without really knowing what will happen to me there.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Yet I know that the Holy Spirit warns me in town after town, saying, ‘Chains and afflictions are prepared for you.’</verse>
				<verse number="24">“But whether I live or die is not important, for I don’t esteem my life as indispensable. It’s more important for me to fulfill my destiny and to finish the ministry my Lord Jesus has assigned to me, which is to faithfully preach the wonderful news of God’s grace.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I’ve been a part of your lives and shared with you many times the message of God’s kingdom realm. But now I leave you, and you will not see my face again.</verse>
				<verse number="26">If any of you should be lost, I will not be blamed, for my conscience is clean,</verse>
				<verse number="27">because I’ve taught you everything I could about God’s eternal plan and I’ve held nothing back.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So guard your hearts. Be true shepherds over all the flock and feed them well. Remember, it was the Holy Spirit who appointed you to guard and oversee the churches that belong to Jesus, the Anointed One, which he purchased and established by his own blood.</verse>
				<verse number="29">“I know that after I leave, imposters who have no loyalty to the flock will come among you like savage wolves.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Even some from among your very own ranks will rise up, twisting the truth to seduce people into following them instead of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="31">So be alert and discerning. Remember that for three years, night and day, I’ve never stopped warning each of you, pouring out my heart to you with tears.</verse>
				<verse number="32">“And so now, I entrust you into God’s hands and the message of his grace, which is all that you need to become strong. All of God’s blessings are imparted through the message of his grace, which he provides as the spiritual inheritance given to all of his holy ones.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“I haven’t been after your money or any of your possessions.</verse>
				<verse number="34">You all know that I’ve worked with my hands to meet my own needs and the needs of those who’ve served with me.</verse>
				<verse number="35">I’ve left you an example of how you should serve and take care of those who are weak. For we must always cherish the words of our Lord Jesus, who taught, ‘Giving brings a far greater blessing than receiving.’  ”</verse>
				<verse number="36">After Paul finished speaking, he knelt down and prayed with them.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Then they all cried with great weeping as one after another hugged Paul and kissed him.</verse>
				<verse number="38">What broke their hearts the most were his words “You will not see my face again.” Then they tearfully accompanied Paul back to the ship.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">After we tore ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed a direct course for the island of Kos, and on the next day to the island of Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</verse>
				<verse number="2">There we found a ship that was crossing over to Syria, so we went aboard and sailed away.</verse>
				<verse number="3">After we sighted Cyprus and sailed south of it, we docked at Tyre in Syria, where the ship unloaded its cargo.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When we went ashore we found a number of believers and stayed with them for a week. They prophesied to Paul repeatedly, warning him by the Holy Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When it was time for us to leave and be on our way, everyone—men, women, and children—accompanied us out of the city down to the beach. After we all knelt in the sand and prayed together,</verse>
				<verse number="6">we kissed one another, said our good-byes, and boarded the ship, while the believers went back to their homes.</verse>
				<verse number="7">From Tyre we sailed on to the town of Akko and greeted the believers there with peace. We stayed with them for a day.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then we went on to Caesarea and stayed for several days in the home of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven deacons and</verse>
				<verse number="9">the father of four unmarried daughters who prophesied.</verse>
				<verse number="10">During our stay of several days, Agabus, a prophet from Judea, came to visit us.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As a prophetic gesture, he took Paul’s belt and tied his own hands and feet with it as he prophesied, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘The one who owns this belt will be tied up in this same way by the Jews and they will hand him over to those who are not Jews.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="12">When we heard this, both we and the believers of Caesarea begged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But Paul replied, “Why do you cry and break my heart with your tears? Don’t you know that I’m prepared not only to be imprisoned but to die in Jerusalem for the sake of the wonder of the name of our Lord Jesus?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Because we couldn’t persuade him, we gave up and said nothing more except “May the will of the Lord be done.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Afterward we packed our bags and set off for Jerusalem,</verse>
				<verse number="16">with some of the believers from Caesarea accompanying us. They brought us to a village where they introduced us to Mnason, a Cypriot, one of the original disciples, and he offered us hospitality.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When we finally arrived in Jerusalem, the believers welcomed us with delight.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The next day Paul and our team had a meeting with Jacob and all the elders of the Jerusalem church.</verse>
				<verse number="19">After greeting everyone, Paul explained in detail what God had accomplished through his ministry among the non-Jewish people.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When they heard Paul’s report, they praised God. And they said to him, “You should know, brother, that there are many tens of thousands of Jews who have also embraced the faith and are passionately keeping the law of Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But they’ve heard a rumor that you’ve been instructing the Jews everywhere to abandon Moses by telling them they don’t need to circumcise their children or keep our Jewish customs.</verse>
				<verse number="22">They will certainly hear that you’ve come to Jerusalem. So what is the proper way to proceed?</verse>
				<verse number="23">We urge you to follow our suggestion. We have four men here who have taken a vow and are ready to have their heads shaved.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Now go with them to the temple and sponsor them in their purification ceremony, and pay all their required expenses. Then everyone will know that the rumors they’ve heard are false. They’ll see that you are one who lives according to the law of Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But in reference to the non-Jewish believers, we’ve sent them a letter with our decision, stating that they should avoid eating meat that has been offered to an idol, or eating blood or any animal that has been strangled, and to avoid sexual immorality.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">The next day, Paul took the four men to the temple and ceremonially purified himself along with them. He publicly gave notice of the date when their vows would end and when sacrifices would be offered for each of them.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When the seven-day period was almost over, a number of Jews from western Turkey who had seen him in the temple courts stirred up the whole crowd against him. Seizing him,</verse>
				<verse number="28">they shouted, “Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches everywhere what is contrary to our nation, our law, and this temple. And not only that, but now he brings these non-Jewish men with him into the inner courts of our temple! They have made this sacred place ritually unclean.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">(For Trophimus, an Ephesian, had been seen previously with him, and they assumed that he entered the inner courts with Paul.)</verse>
				<verse number="30">This ignited a huge riot in the city as all the people came together to seize Paul and drag him out of the temple courts, closing the gates behind him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">But as they were about to kill Paul, the news reached the commander of the Roman garrison that the entire city was in an uproar.</verse>
				<verse number="32">He immediately ran out to the crowd with a large number of his officers and soldiers. When the crowd saw them coming, they stopped beating Paul.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The commander arrested him and ordered that he be bound with two chains. He then asked, “Who is he and what has he done wrong?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Some in the crowd shouted one thing and others something else, just adding to the confusion. Since the commander was unable to get to the truth because of the disturbance, he ordered that Paul be brought back to their headquarters.</verse>
				<verse number="35">When they reached the steps leading up to the fortress, they had to protect Paul and carry him up because of the violent mob following them,</verse>
				<verse number="36">and everyone was screaming out, “Away with this man! Kill him!”</verse>
				<verse number="37">As Paul was being led to the entrance of the compound, he said to the commander in Greek, “May I have a word with you?” The commander replied, “So you know Greek, do you?</verse>
				<verse number="38">Aren’t you that Egyptian fanatic who started a rebellion some time ago and led four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Paul answered, “I am, in fact, a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a well-known city of southern Turkey where I was born. I beg you, sir, please give me a moment to speak to these people.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">When the commander gave his permission, Paul stood on the steps and gestured with his hands for the people to listen. When the crowd quieted down, Paul addressed them in Aramaic and said:</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">“Ladies and gentlemen, fellow believers and elders —please listen to me as I offer my defense.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">(Now, when everyone realized he was speaking to them in their Judean Aramaic language, the crowd became all the more attentive.)</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Paul said, “I am a Jewish man who was born in Tarsus, a city of Turkey. However, I grew up in this city and was properly trained in the Mosaic law and tutored by Rabbi Gamaliel according to our ancestral customs. I’ve been extremely passionate in my desire to please God, just as all of you are today.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I’ve hunted down and killed the followers of this Way. I have seized them and thrown them into prison, both men and women.</verse>
				<verse number="5">All of this can be verified by the high priest and the Supreme Council of Elders. For they even wrote letters to our fellow Jews of Damascus, authorizing me to arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“As I was on the road approaching Damascus, about noon, a brilliant heavenly light suddenly appeared, flashing all around me.</verse>
				<verse number="7">As I fell to the ground I heard a voice say, ‘Saul, Saul . . . why are you persecuting me?’</verse>
				<verse number="8">“I answered, ‘Who are you, my Lord?’ “He said to me, ‘I am Jesus, the Victorious. I am the one you are persecuting.’</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Those who were with me saw the brilliant light, but they didn’t hear the voice of the one who spoke to me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“So I asked, ‘Lord, what am I to do?’ “And the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all that you are destined to do.’</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Because of the dazzling glory of the light, I couldn’t see—I was left blind. So they had to lead me by the hand the rest of the way into Damascus.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“A Jewish man living there named Ananias came to see me. He was a godly man who lived according to the law of Moses and was highly esteemed by the Jewish community.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He stood beside me and said, ‘Saul! My brother, Saul—open your eyes and see again!’ At that very instant I opened my eyes and I could see!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then he said to me, ‘The God of our ancestors has destined you to know his plan and for you to see the Holy One and to hear his voice.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For you will be his witness to every race of people and will share with them everything that you’ve seen and heard.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So now, what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized, and wash away your sins as you call upon his name.’</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Then I returned to Jerusalem. And while I was praying in the temple, I entered another realm</verse>
				<verse number="18">and saw him. He said to me, ‘Hurry and depart from Jerusalem quickly, for the people here will not receive the truths you share about me.’</verse>
				<verse number="19">“ ‘But Lord,’ I argued, ‘they all know that I’m the one who went into our Jewish meetings to find those who believe in you and had them beaten and imprisoned.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When the blood of your witness Stephen was shed, I stood nearby in full approval of what was happening. I even guarded the cloaks of those who stoned him to death.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Then he said to me, ‘Go at once, for I am sending you to preach to the non-Jewish nations.’  ”</verse>
				<verse number="22">The crowd listened attentively to Paul up to this point. But when they heard this, all at once they erupted with loud shouts, saying, “Get rid of this man! Kill him! He doesn’t deserve to live!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">While the crowd was screaming and yelling, removing their outer garments, and throwing handfuls of dust in the air in protest,</verse>
				<verse number="24">the commander had Paul brought back into the compound. He ordered that he be whipped with a lash and interrogated to find out what he said that so infuriated the crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="25">When the soldiers stretched Paul out with ropes, he said to the captain, who was standing nearby, “Is it legal for you to torture a Roman citizen like this, without a proper trial?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">When the officer heard this, he immediately went to his commander and reported it, saying, “This man is a Roman citizen. What should we do now?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">The commander came to Paul and asked him, “Tell me the truth, are you a Roman citizen?” “Yes I am,” he replied.</verse>
				<verse number="28">The commander said, “I had to purchase my citizenship with a great sum of money.” Paul replied, “I was born as a citizen!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">All of the soldiers who were about to whip Paul backed away, because they were afraid of the consequences for tying up and holding a Roman citizen against his will.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The next day the commander ordered that the high priest and the supreme Jewish council be convened, because he wanted to find out exactly why the Jews were accusing Paul. So he had him untied and brought out to stand before them all.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="23">
				<verse number="1">Paul fixed his eyes on the members of the council and said, “My brothers, up to this day I have lived my life before God with a perfectly clear conscience.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">At that moment, Ananias the high priest ordered those standing near Paul to strike him in the mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Paul responded, “God is going to strike you, you corrupt pretender! For you sit there judging me according to the law, yet you broke the law when you ordered me to be struck.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Those standing near Paul said to him, “Do you dare insult the high priest of God?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Paul answered, “I had no idea, brothers, that he was the high priest. For the Scriptures say, ‘Do not curse the ruler of your people.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Just then Paul realized that part of the council were Sadducees, who deny the resurrection of the dead, and others were of the separated ones. So he shouted, “My fellow Jews, I am a separated one, and the son of a separated one. That’s why I’m on trial here. It’s because of the hope I have that the dead will rise to live again.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">When he said this, a heated argument started among them, dividing the council between the Sadducees and the separated ones.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Paul knew that the Sadducees teach there is no resurrection and do not believe in angels or spirits, but the separated ones believe in them all.</verse>
				<verse number="9">This sparked an even greater uproar among them. Finally, some of the separated ones who were religious scholars stood up and protested strongly, saying, “We find nothing wrong with this man. It could be that the Spirit has spoken to him or an angel came to him.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">When the shouting match became intense, the commander, fearing they would tear Paul to pieces, intervened and ordered his soldiers to go in to their meeting and seize him and take him back to their headquarters.</verse>
				<verse number="11">That night our Lord appeared to Paul and stood before him and said, “Receive miracle power. For just as you have spoken for me in Jerusalem, you will also speak for me in Rome.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">The next day, more than forty Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath to have no food or water until they had killed Paul.</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">They went to the high priest and the elders to divulge their plans and said to them, “We have united in a solemn oath not to eat or drink until Paul is dead.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So we urge you to have the commander bring him to you as though you were to determine his case with a more thorough inquiry. And we will kill him before he even gets here!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">When Paul’s nephew, his sister’s son, overheard their plot to kill him, he came to the headquarters and informed him of their plans.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Paul called for one of the captains and said, “Take this boy to the commander, for he has something important to report to him.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">The captain took him to the commander and informed him, “Paul the prisoner asked me to bring this boy to you because he has something important for you to know.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">The commander took him by the arm and led him aside in private and asked him, “What do you have to tell me?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">He replied, “The Jews have plotted to kill Paul. Tomorrow they will ask you to bring him again to the supreme council under the pretense of wanting to question him further.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Don’t believe them, because they have forty men lying in wait to ambush Paul. These men have sworn an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They’re all waiting for you to agree to their request so they can carry out their plot.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">The commander dismissed Paul’s nephew after directing him, “Tell no one that you’ve reported these things to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then he summoned two of his captains and said to them, “I want you to take Paul by horseback to Caesarea tonight at nine o’clock. Dispatch two hundred infantrymen, seventy horsemen, and another two hundred spearmen to provide security and deliver him safely to Governor Felix.”</verse>
				<verse number="24"></verse>
				<verse number="25">He sent with them a letter that read:</verse>
				<verse number="26">From Claudias Lysias, to His Excellency, Governor Felix: Dear Governor,</verse>
				<verse number="27">I rescued this man, who was seized by the Jews as they were about to put him to death. I intervened with my troops because I understand that he is a Roman citizen.</verse>
				<verse number="28">I was determined to learn exactly what charge they were accusing him of, so I brought him to stand before the Jewish supreme council.</verse>
				<verse number="29">I discovered that he was being accused with reference to violating controversial issues about their law, but I found no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.</verse>
				<verse number="30">When I was informed of an imminent plot to kill him, I sent him to you at once, and I have ordered his accusers to also come before you and state their charges against him. Sincerely, Claudius Lysias</verse>
				<verse number="31">The soldiers carried out their orders and escorted Paul during the night until they reached the city of Antipatris.</verse>
				<verse number="32">The next day the horsemen continued on with Paul and the rest of the soldiers were dismissed to return to their headquarters.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Upon their arrival in Caesarea, they presented the letter to the governor and brought Paul before him.</verse>
				<verse number="34">After reading the letter, he asked Paul what province he was from. Paul answered, “Southeast Turkey.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">The governor said, “I will give you a full hearing when your accusers arrive here also.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="24">
				<verse number="1">Five days later, Ananias the high priest arrived in Caesarea, accompanied by some Jewish elders and Tertullus, their prosecuting attorney. They were brought before the governor to present formal charges against Paul.</verse>
				<verse number="2">After Paul was summoned, Tertullus accused him, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Your Excellency Felix, under the shadow of your wise leadership we Jews have experienced a long period of peace. Because of your wise foresight, many reforms are coming to pass in our nation because of you, Most Honorable Felix. We deeply appreciate this and thank you very much.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“So that I won’t weary you with a lengthy presentation, I beg you to hear our brief summary, with your customary graciousness.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For we have found this man to be a contagious plague, a seditious man who continually stirs up riots among the Jews all over the world. He has become a ringleader of the sect known as the Nazarenes.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He has even attempted to desecrate our temple, which is why we had him arrested. We sought to judge him according to our law,</verse>
				<verse number="7">but Commander Lysias came with great force, snatched him away from our hands, and sent him here to you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He has ordered his accusers to come to you so that you could interrogate him and ascertain for yourself that all these charges we are bringing against him are true.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">All the Jews present joined in the verbal attack, saying, “Yes, it’s true!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">The governor motioned that it was Paul’s turn to speak, so he began to answer the accusations. “Because I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I gladly respond in my defense.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You can easily verify that about twelve days ago, I went to Jerusalem to worship.</verse>
				<verse number="12">No one found me arguing with anyone or causing trouble among the people in the synagogues or in the temple or anywhere in the city.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They are completely unable to prove these accusations they make against me.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“But I do confess this to you: I worship the God of our Jewish ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. For I believe everything that is written in the Law and the Prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And my hope is in God, the same hope that even my accusers have embraced, the hope of a resurrection from the dead of both the righteous and the unrighteous.</verse>
				<verse number="16">That’s why I seek with all my heart to have a clean conscience toward God and toward others.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“After being away from Jerusalem for several years, I returned to bring to my people gifts for the poor.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I was in the temple, ritually purified and presenting my offering to God, when they seized me. I had no noisy crowd around me, and I wasn’t causing trouble or making any kind of disturbance whatsoever.</verse>
				<verse number="19">It was a group of Jews from western Turkey who were being unruly; they are the ones who should be here now to bring their charges if they have anything against me.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Or at least these men standing before you should clearly state what crime they found me guilty of when I stood before the Jewish supreme council,</verse>
				<verse number="21">unless it’s the one thing I passionately spoke out when I stood among them. I am on trial today only because of my belief in the resurrection of the dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Felix, who was well acquainted with the facts about the Way, concluded the hearing with these words: “I will decide your case after Commander Lysias arrives.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">He then ordered the captain to keep Paul in protective custody, but to give him a measure of freedom, he allowed any of his friends to visit him and help take care of his needs.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Several days later, Felix came back with his wife, Drusilla, who was Jewish. They sent for Paul and listened as he shared with them about faith in Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="25">As Paul spoke about true righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became terrified and said, “Leave me for now. I’ll send for you later when it’s more convenient.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">He expected to receive a bribe from Paul for his release, so for that reason he would send for Paul from time to time to converse with him.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Two years later, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Before he left office he decided to leave Paul in prison as a political favor to the Jews.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="25">
				<verse number="1">Three days after Festus assumed his duties in Caesarea, he made the journey to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Religious authorities and prominent leaders among the Jews brought formal charges against Paul before Festus.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They came asking him for a favor—that he would transfer Paul from Caesarea to Jerusalem—all the while plotting to ambush and kill Paul along the way.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Festus responded to their request by informing them that he planned to return to Caesarea shortly.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He told them, “Your leaders can come with me to Caesarea. If this man has broken any laws, you can bring charges against him there.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">After Festus had stayed in Jerusalem no more than eight to ten days, he left for Caesarea. The day after he arrived, he convened the court and took his seat on the bench as judge over the proceedings. After he ordered Paul brought into the courtroom,</verse>
				<verse number="7">the Jewish leaders who came from Jerusalem encircled him and leveled against him many serious charges, which they were unable to substantiate.</verse>
				<verse number="8">In his defense, Paul said by the Holy Spirit, “I have done nothing wrong. I’ve committed no offense against Jewish law, or against the temple, or against Caesar.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Festus, because he wanted to curry favor with the Jews, asked Paul, “Are you willing to go with me to Jerusalem and be tried for these charges?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Paul replied, “I am standing here before Caesar’s tribunal. This is where I should be tried. As you well know, I have done no harm to the Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="11">If I have committed a crime worthy of death, I won’t seek to escape the death penalty. But if none of their charges are true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">After conferring with the members of his council, Festus replied, “Since you have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you will go!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Several days later, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea for a visit with Festus.</verse>
				<verse number="14">During their stay of many days, Festus explained Paul’s situation to the king to get his opinion on the matter, saying, “There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When I was in Jerusalem, the leading priests and Jewish elders pressed charges against him and demanded that I issue a guilty verdict against him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I explained to them that it is not our Roman custom to condemn any man before he has an opportunity to face his accusers and present his defense.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So they returned here with me. I didn’t postpone the trial, but convened the court the very next day and ordered the man to be brought before me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I listened to their accusations against him, but they were not what I expected to hear, for he had committed no crime.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Rather, their issues centered around disagreements with him over their religion, and about a dead man named Jesus, who Paul claimed was alive.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Because I was perplexed about how to proceed, I asked him if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem to stand trial on these charges.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When Paul appealed his case to the emperor for a decision, I ordered him to be held in custody until I could send him to Caesar.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">King Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to listen to this man myself.” “Tomorrow,” he replied, “you will have that opportunity.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">The next day King Agrippa and Bernice entered the audience hall with much pomp and pageantry. Accompanying them were the senior military officers and prominent citizens. Festus ordered that Paul be brought before them all.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then Festus said, “King Agrippa, and esteemed guests, here is the man whom the entire Jewish community, both here and in Jerusalem, has asked me to condemn to death. They have screamed and shouted at me, demanding that I end his life.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Yet upon investigation I couldn’t find one thing that he has done to deserve the death penalty. When he appealed to His Majesty the emperor, I determined to send him.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But I have nothing concrete to write to His Majesty, so I have now brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa. After this preliminary hearing I should have something to write,</verse>
				<verse number="27">for it seems absurd to me to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="26">
				<verse number="1">King Agrippa said to Paul, “You may now state your case.” Paul motioned with his hand for silence, then began his defense.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“King Agrippa, I consider myself highly favored to stand before you today and answer the charges made against me by the Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Because you, more than anyone else, are very familiar with the customs and controversies among the Jewish people, I now ask for your patience as I state my case.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“All the Jews know how I have been raised as a young man, living among my own people from the beginning and in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="5">If my accusers are willing to testify, they must admit that they’ve known me all along as a Pharisee, a member of the most strict and orthodox sect within Judaism.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And now, here I am on trial because I believe in the hope of God’s promises made to our ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="7">This is the promise the twelve tribes of our people hope to see fulfilled as they sincerely strive to serve God with prayers night and day. “So, Your Highness, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And how should you judge this matter? Why is it that any of you think it unbelievable that God raises the dead?</verse>
				<verse number="9">I used to think that I should do all that was in my power to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And that’s exactly what I did in Jerusalem, for I not only imprisoned many of the holy believers by the authority of the chief priests, I also cast my vote against them, sentencing them to death.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I punished them often in every Jewish meeting hall and attempted to force them to blaspheme. I boiled with rage against them, hunting them down in distant foreign cities to persecute them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“For that purpose I went to Damascus, with the authority granted to me by the chief priests.</verse>
				<verse number="13">While traveling on the road at noon, Your Highness, I saw a light brighter than the sun flashing from heaven all around me and those who were with me.</verse>
				<verse number="14">We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice speaking to me in Aramaic, saying, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? You are only hurting yourself when you resist your calling.’</verse>
				<verse number="15">“I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ “And the Lord replied, ‘I am Jesus, the one you are persecuting.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Get up and stand to your feet, for I have appeared to you to reveal your destiny and to commission you as my assistant. You will be a witness to what you have seen and to the things I will reveal whenever I appear to you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I will rescue you from the persecution of your own people and from the hostility of the other nations that I will send you to.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And you will open their eyes to their true condition, so that they may turn from darkness to the Light and from the power of Satan to the power of God. By placing their faith in me they will receive the total forgiveness of sins and be made holy, taking hold of the inheritance that I give to my children!’</verse>
				<verse number="19">“So you see, King Agrippa, I have not been disobedient to what was revealed to me from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For it was in Damascus that I first declared the truth. And then I went to Jerusalem and throughout our nation, and even to other nations, telling people everywhere that they must repent and turn to God and demonstrate it with a changed life.</verse>
				<verse number="21">That’s why the Jews seized me when I was in the temple and tried to murder me.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“But in spite of all this, I have experienced the supernatural help of God up to this very moment. So I’m standing here saying the same thing that I’ve shared with everyone, from the least to the greatest. For I teach nothing but what</verse>
				<verse number="23">Moses and the prophets have said was destined to happen: that our Messiah had to suffer and die and be the first to rise from the dead, to release the bright light of truth both to our people and to the non-Jewish nations.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Festus interrupted Paul’s defense, blurting out, “You’re out of your mind! All this great learning of yours is driving you crazy.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Paul replied, “No, Your Excellency Festus, I am not crazy. I speak the words of truth and reason.</verse>
				<verse number="26">King Agrippa, I know I can speak frankly and freely with you, for you understand these matters well, and none of these things have escaped your notice. After all, it’s not like it was a secret!</verse>
				<verse number="27">Don’t you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you do.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Agrippa responded, “In such a short time you are nearly persuading me to become a Christian.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Paul replied, “I pray to God that both you and those here listening to me would one day become the same as I am, except, of course, without these chains.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">The king, the governor, Bernice, and all the others got up.</verse>
				<verse number="31">As they were leaving the chamber, they commented to one another, “This man has done nothing that deserves death or even imprisonment.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">King Agrippa said to Festus, “If he hadn’t appealed to Caesar, he could have been released.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="27">
				<verse number="1">When it was decided that we were to sail for Italy, Festus handed over Paul and a number of other prisoners to the custody of a Roman officer named Julius, a member of the imperial guard.</verse>
				<verse number="2">We went on board a ship from the port of Adramyttium that was planning to stop at various ports along the coast of southwestern Turkey. We put out to sea and were accompanied by Aristarchus from Thessalonica in Macedonia.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The next day we docked at Sidon, and Julius, being considerate of Paul, allowed him to disembark and be refreshed by his friends living there.</verse>
				<verse number="4">From there we put out to sea, but because the winds were against us, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus.</verse>
				<verse number="5">After sailing across the open sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we docked at the port of Myra in Lycia.</verse>
				<verse number="6">While we were there, the commanding officer found an Egyptian ship from Alexandria that was bound for Italy, and he put us on board.</verse>
				<verse number="7">We made little headway for several days, and with difficulty we made it to Knidus. The strong winds kept us from holding our course, so from there we sailed along the lee of Crete, opposite Cape Salome.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Hugging the coast, we struggled on to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.</verse>
				<verse number="9">We remained there a long time, until we passed the day of the Jewish fast. Paul advised the frightened sailors that they should not put out to sea in such dangerous weather, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Men, I can see that our voyage would be disastrous for us and bring great loss, not only to our ship and cargo but also to our own lives. We should remain here.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">But the officer in charge was persuaded more by the ship’s helmsman and captain than he was by Paul.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So the majority decided to put out to sea, since Fair Haven was an exposed harbor and not suitable to winter in. They had hoped to somehow reach the Cretan port of Phineka, which was a more suitable port because it was facing south.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When a gentle south breeze began to blow, they assumed they could make it, so they pulled up anchor and sailed close to Crete.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But it wasn’t long before the weather abruptly worsened and a storm of hurricane force called the Nor’easter tore across the island and blew us out to sea.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The sailors weren’t able to turn the ship into the wind, so they gave up and let it be driven by the gale winds.</verse>
				<verse number="16">As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were barely able to get the ship’s lifeboat under control,</verse>
				<verse number="17">so the crew hoisted the dinghy aboard. The sailors used ropes and cables to undergird the ship, fearing they would run aground on the shoals of Syrtis. They lowered the drag anchor to slow its speed and let the ship be driven along.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The next day, because of being battered severely by the storm, the sailors jettisoned the cargo,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and by the third day they even threw the ship’s tackle and rigging overboard.</verse>
				<verse number="20">After many days of seeing neither the sun nor the stars, and with the violent storm continuing to rage against us, all hope of ever getting through it alive was abandoned.</verse>
				<verse number="21">After being without food for a long time, Paul stepped before them all and said, “Men, you should have obeyed me and avoided all of this pain and suffering by not leaving Crete.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Now listen to me. Don’t be depressed, for no one will perish—only the ship will be lost.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For God’s angel visited me last night, the angel of my God, the God I passionately serve. He came and stood in front of me</verse>
				<verse number="24">and said, ‘Don’t be afraid, Paul. You are destined to stand trial before Caesar. And because of God’s favor on you, he has given you the lives of everyone who is sailing with you.’</verse>
				<verse number="25">So men, keep up your courage! I know that God will protect you, just as he told me he would.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But we must run aground on some island to be saved.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">On the fourteenth night of being tossed about the Adriatic Sea, about midnight, the sailors sensed we were approaching land.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So they took soundings and discovered that the water was about 120 feet deep. After sailing a short distance, they again took soundings and found it was only ninety feet deep.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Fearing we would be dashed against a rocky coast, they dropped four anchors from the stern and waited for morning to come.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Some sailors pretended to go down to drop anchors from the bow when in fact they wanted to lower the lifeboat into the sea and escape, abandoning ship.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Paul said to the Roman officer and his soldiers, “Unless you all stay together onboard the ship, you have no chance of surviving.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">At the moment they heard this, the soldiers cut the ropes of the dinghy and let it fall away.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Just before daybreak, Paul urged everyone to eat. He said, “Today makes two full weeks that you’ve been in fearful peril and hunger, unable to eat a thing.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Now eat and be nourished. For you’ll all come through this ordeal without a scratch.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then Paul took bread and gave thanks to God in front of them, broke it and began to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="36">There were 276 people who ate until they were filled, and were strengthened and encouraged.</verse>
				<verse number="37"></verse>
				<verse number="38">After they were satisfied, they threw the grain into the sea to lighten the ship.</verse>
				<verse number="39">When daylight came, the sailors didn’t recognize the land, but they noticed a cove with a sandy beach, so they decided to run the ship ashore.</verse>
				<verse number="40">They cut away the anchors, leaving them in the sea, untied the ropes holding the rudders, and hoisted the foresail to the breeze to head for the beach.</verse>
				<verse number="41">But they drifted into the rocky shoals between two depths of the sea, causing the ship to flounder still a distance from shore. The bow was stuck fast, jammed on the rocks, while the stern was being smashed by the pounding of the surf.</verse>
				<verse number="42">The soldiers wanted to kill all the prisoners to prevent them from escaping.</verse>
				<verse number="43">But the Roman officer was determined to bring Paul safely through, so he foiled their attempts. He commanded the prisoners and crew who could swim to jump overboard and swim ashore.</verse>
				<verse number="44">The rest all managed to survive by clinging to planks and broken pieces of the ship, so that everyone scrambled to the shore uninjured.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="28">
				<verse number="1">After we had safely reached land, we discovered that the island we were on was Malta.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The people who lived there showed us extraordinary kindness, for they welcomed us around the fire they had built because it was cold and rainy.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When Paul had gathered an armful of brushwood and was setting it on the fire, a venomous snake was driven out by the heat and latched onto Paul’s hand with its fangs.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When the islanders saw the snake dangling from Paul’s hand, they said to one another, “No doubt about it, this guy is a murderer. Even though he escaped death at sea, Justice has now caught up with him!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But Paul shook the snake off, flung it into the fire, and suffered no harm at all.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Everyone watched him, expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. After observing him for a long time and seeing that nothing unusual happened, they changed their minds and said, “He must be a god!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">The Roman governor of the island, named Publius, had his estate nearby. He graciously welcomed us as his houseguests and showed us hospitality for the three days that we stayed with him.</verse>
				<verse number="8">His father lay sick in bed, suffering from fits of high fever and dysentery. So Paul went into his room, and after praying, placed his hands on him. He was instantly healed.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When the people of the island heard about this miracle, they brought all the sick to Paul, and they were also healed.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The islanders honored us greatly, and when we were preparing to set sail again, they gave us all the supplies we needed for our journey.</verse>
				<verse number="11">After three months we put out to sea on an Egyptian ship from Alexandria that had wintered at the island. The ship had carved on its prow as its emblem the “Heavenly Twins.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">When we landed at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.</verse>
				<verse number="13">From there we set sail for the Italian city of Rhegium. The day after we landed, a south wind sprang up that enabled us to reach Puteoli in two days.</verse>
				<verse number="14">There we found some believers, who begged us to stay with them for a week. Afterward, we made our way to Rome.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When the believers were alerted we were coming, they came out to meet us at the Forum of Appius while we were still a great distance from Rome. Another group met us at the Three Taverns. When Paul saw the believers, his heart was greatly encouraged and he thanked God.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When we finally entered Rome, Paul was turned over to the authorities and was allowed to live where he pleased, with one soldier assigned to guard him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">After three days Paul called together all the prominent members of the Jewish community of Rome. When they had all assembled, Paul said to them, “My fellow Jews, while I was in Jerusalem, I was handed over as a prisoner of the Romans for prosecution, even though I had done nothing against any of our people or our Jewish customs.</verse>
				<verse number="18">After hearing my case, the Roman authorities wanted to release me since they found nothing that deserved a death sentence.</verse>
				<verse number="19">When the Jews objected to this, I felt it necessary, with no malice against them, to appeal to Caesar.</verse>
				<verse number="20">This, then, is the reason I’ve asked to speak with you, so that I could explain these things. It is only because I believe in the Hope of Israel that I am in chains before you.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">They replied, “We haven’t received any letters from the Jews of Judea, nor has anyone come to us with a bad report about you.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But we are anxious to hear you present your views regarding this Christian sect we’ve been hearing about, for people everywhere are speaking against it.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So they set a time to meet with Paul. On that day an even greater crowd gathered where he was staying. From morning until evening Paul taught them, opening up the truths of God’s kingdom. With convincing arguments from both the Law and the Prophets, he tried to persuade them about Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Some were converted, but others refused to believe. They argued back and forth,</verse>
				<verse number="25">still unable to agree among themselves. They were about to leave when Paul made one last statement to them: “The Holy Spirit stated it well when he spoke to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah:</verse>
				<verse number="26">‘I send you to this people to say to them, “You will keep learning, but not understanding. You will keep staring at truth but not perceiving it.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For your hearts are hard and insensitive to me—you must be hard of hearing! For you’ve closed your eyes so that you won’t be troubled by the truth, and you’ve covered your ears so that you won’t have to listen and be pierced by what I say. For then you would have to respond and repent, so that I could heal your hearts.” ’</verse>
				<verse number="28">“So listen well. This wonderful salvation given by God is now being presented to the non-Jewish nations, and they will believe and receive it!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Paul lived two more years in Rome, in his own rented quarters, welcoming all who came to visit.</verse>
				<verse number="30">He continued to proclaim to all the truths of God’s kingdom realm, teaching them about the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, speaking triumphantly and without any restriction.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">Paul, a loving and loyal servant of the Anointed One, Jesus. He called me to be his apostle and set me apart with a mission to reveal God’s wonderful gospel. (7) I write to all his beloved chosen ones in Rome, for you are also called as holy ones. May his joyous grace and total well-being, flowing from our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, rest upon you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">My commission is to preach the good news. Yet it is not entirely new, but the fulfillment of the hope promised to us through his prophets in the sacred Scriptures.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For the gospel is all about God’s Son. As a man he descended from David’s royal lineage,</verse>
				<verse number="4">but as the mighty Son of God he was raised from the dead and miraculously set apart with a display of triumphant power supplied by the Spirit of Holiness. And now Jesus is our Lord and our Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Through him grace cascaded into us, empowering us with the gift of apostleship, so that we can win people from every nation into the obedience that comes from faith, to bring honor to his name.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And you are among the chosen ones who are called to belong to Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="7"></verse>
				<verse number="8">I give thanks to God for all of you, because the testimony of your faith is spreading throughout the world.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And God knows that I pray for you continually and at all times. For I serve and worship him with my spirit in the gospel of his Son.</verse>
				<verse number="10">My desire and constant prayer is that I would succeed in coming to you, according to the plan and timing of God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I yearn to come and be face-to-face with you and get to know you. For I long to impart to you some spiritual gift that will empower you to stand strong in your faith.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now, this means that when we come together and are side by side, something wonderful will be released. We can expect to be co-encouraged and co-comforted by each other’s faith!</verse>
				<verse number="13">So, my dear brothers and sisters, please don’t interpret my failure to visit you as indifference, because many times I’ve intended to come but have not been released to do so up to now. For I long to enjoy a harvest of spiritual fruit among you, like I have experienced among the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Love obligates me to preach to everyone, to those who are among the elite and those who are among the outcasts, to those who are wise and educated as well as to those who are foolish and unlearned.</verse>
				<verse number="15">This is why I am so excited about coming to preach the wonderful message of Jesus to you in Rome!</verse>
				<verse number="16">I refuse to be ashamed of the wonderful message of God’s liberating power unleashed in us through Christ! For I am thrilled to preach that everyone who believes is saved—the Jew first, and then people everywhere!</verse>
				<verse number="17">This gospel unveils a continual revelation of God’s righteousness—a perfect righteousness given to us when we believe. And it moves us from receiving life through faith, to the power of living by faith. This is what the Scripture means when it says: “We are right with God through life-giving faith!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">For God in heaven unveils his holy anger breaking forth against every form of sin, both toward ungodliness that lives in hearts and evil actions. For the wickedness of humanity deliberately smothers the truth and keeps people from acknowledging the truth about God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">In reality, the truth of God is known instinctively, for God has embedded this knowledge inside every human heart.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Opposition to truth cannot be excused on the basis of ignorance, because from the creation of the world, the invisible qualities of God’s nature have been made visible, such as his eternal power and transcendence. He has made his wonderful attributes easily perceived, for seeing the visible makes us understand the invisible. So then, this leaves everyone without excuse.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Throughout human history the fingerprints of God were upon them, yet they refused to honor him as God or even be thankful for his kindness. Instead, they entertained corrupt and foolish thoughts about what God was like. This left them with nothing but misguided hearts, steeped in moral darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Although claiming to be wise, they were in fact shallow fools.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For only a fool would trade the unfading splendor of the immortal God to worship the fading image of other humans, idols made to look like people, animals, birds, and even creeping reptiles!</verse>
				<verse number="24">This is why God lifted off his restraining hand and let them have full expression of their sinful and shameful desires. They were given over to moral depravity, dishonoring their bodies by sexual perversion among themselves—</verse>
				<verse number="25">all because they traded the truth of God for a lie. They worshiped and served the things God made rather than the God who made all things—glory and praises to him forever and ever! Amen!</verse>
				<verse number="26">For this reason God gave them over to their own disgraceful and vile passions. Enflamed with lust for one another, men and women ignored the natural order and exchanged normal sexual relations for homosexuality. Women engaged in lesbian conduct, and men committed shameful acts with men, receiving in themselves the due penalty for their deviation.</verse>
				<verse number="27"></verse>
				<verse number="28">And because they thought it was worthless to embrace the true knowledge of God, God gave them over to a worthless mind-set, to break all rules of proper conduct.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Their sinful lives became full of every kind of evil, wicked schemes, greed, and cruelty. Their hearts overflowed with jealous cravings, and with conflict and strife, which drove them into hateful arguments and murder. They are deceitful liars full of hostility. They are gossips</verse>
				<verse number="30">who love to spread malicious slander. With inflated egos they hurl hateful insults at God, yet they are nothing more than arrogant boasters. They are rebels against their parents and totally immoral.</verse>
				<verse number="31">They are senseless, faithless, ruthless, heartless, and completely merciless.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Although they are fully aware of God’s laws and proper order, and knowing that those who do all of these things deserve to die, yet they still go headlong into darkness, encouraging others to do the same and applauding them when they do!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">No matter who you are, before you judge the wickedness of others, you had better remember this: you are also without excuse, for you too are guilty of the same kind of things! When you judge others, and then do the same things they do, you condemn yourself.</verse>
				<verse number="2">We know that God’s judgment falls upon those who practice these things. God is always right, because he has all the facts.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And no matter who you think you are, when you judge others who do these things and then do the same things yourself, what makes you think that you will escape God’s judgment?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Do the riches of his extraordinary kindness make you take him for granted and despise him? Haven’t you experienced how kind and understanding he has been to you? Don’t mistake his tolerance for acceptance. Do you realize that all the wealth of his extravagant kindness is meant to melt your heart and lead you into repentance?</verse>
				<verse number="5">But because of your calloused heart and refusal to change direction, you are piling up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment is revealed.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For: He will give to each one in return for what he has done.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For those living in constant goodness and doing what pleases him, seeking an unfading glory and honor and imperishable virtue, will experience eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But those governed by selfishness and self-promotion, whose hearts are unresponsive to God’s truth and would rather embrace unrighteousness, will experience the fullness of wrath.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Anyone who does evil can expect tribulation and distress—to the Jew first and also to the non-Jew.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But when we do what pleases God, we can expect unfading glory, true honor, and a continual peace—to the Jew first and also to the non-Jew,</verse>
				<verse number="11">for God sees us all without partiality.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When people who have never been exposed to the laws of Moses commit sin, they will still perish for what they do. And those who are under the law of Moses and fail to obey it are condemned by the law.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For it’s not merely knowing the law that makes you right with God, but doing all that the law says that will cause God to pronounce you innocent.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For example, whenever people who don’t possess the law as their birthright commit sin, it still confirms that a “law” is present in their conscience. For when they instinctively do what the law requires, that becomes a “law” to govern them, even though they don’t have Mosaic law.</verse>
				<verse number="15">It demonstrates that the requirements of the law are woven into their hearts. They know what is right and wrong, for their conscience validates this “law” in their heart. Their thoughts correct them in one instance and commend them in another.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So this judgment will be revealed on the day when God, through Jesus the Messiah, judges the hidden secrets of people’s hearts. And their response to my gospel will be the standard of judgment used in that day.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now, you claim to be a Jew because you lean upon your trust in the law and boast in your relationship with God.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And you claim to know the will of God, and to have the moral high ground because you’ve been taught the law of Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You are also confident that you are a qualified guide to those who are “blind,” a shining light to those who live in darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You are confident that you are a true teacher of the foolish and immature, all because you have the treasury of truth and knowledge in the law of Moses.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So let me ask you this: Why don’t you practice what you preach? You preach, “Don’t steal!” but are you a thief?</verse>
				<verse number="22">You are swift to tell others, “Don’t commit adultery!” but are you guilty of adultery? You say, “I hate idolatry and false gods!” but do you withhold from the true God what is due him?</verse>
				<verse number="23">Even though you boast in the law, you dishonor God, the Lawgiver, when you break it!</verse>
				<verse number="24">For your actions seem to fulfill what is written: “God’s precious name is cursed among the nations because of you.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">You trust in the covenant sign of circumcision, yet circumcision only has value if you faithfully keep the teachings of the law. But if you violate the law, you have invalidated your circumcision.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And if the uncircumcised one faithfully keeps the law, won’t his obedience make him more “Jewish” than the actual rite of circumcision?</verse>
				<verse number="27">And won’t the one who has never had the knife cut his foreskin be your judge when you break the law?</verse>
				<verse number="28">You are not a Jew if it’s only superficial—for it’s more than the surgical cut of a knife that makes you Jewish.</verse>
				<verse number="29">But you are Jewish because of the inward act of spiritual circumcision—a radical change that lays bare your heart. It’s not by the principle of the written code, but by power of the Holy Spirit. For then your praise will not come from people, but from God himself!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">So then what is the importance of circumcision, and what advantage is there of being a Jew?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Actually, there are numerous advantages. Most important, God distinguished the Jews from all other people by entrusting them with the revelation of his prophetic promises.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But what if some were unfaithful to their divine calling? Does their unbelief weaken God’s faithfulness?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Absolutely not! God will always be proven faithful and true to his word, while people are proven to be liars. This will fulfill what was written in the Scriptures: Your words will always be vindicated and you will rise victorious when you are being tried by your critics!</verse>
				<verse number="5">But what if our wrong shows how right God is? Doesn’t our bad serve the purpose of making God look good? (Of course, I’m only speaking from a human viewpoint.) Would that infer that God is unfair when he displays his anger against wrongdoing?</verse>
				<verse number="6">Absolutely not! For if that were the case, how could God be the righteous judge of all the earth?</verse>
				<verse number="7">So, if my lie brings into sharp contrast the brightness of God’s truth, and if my lie accentuates his glory, then why should I be condemned as a sinner?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Is it proper for us to sin, just so good things may come? May it never be! Yet there are some who slander us and claim that is what we teach. They deserve to be condemned for even saying it!</verse>
				<verse number="9">So, are we to conclude then that we Jews are superior to all others? Certainly not! For we have already proven that both Jews and gentiles are all under the bondage of sin.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And the Scriptures agree, for it is written: There is no one who always does what is right, no, not even one!</verse>
				<verse number="11">There is no one with true spiritual insight, and there is no one who seeks after God alone.</verse>
				<verse number="12">All have deliberately wandered from God’s ways. All have become depraved and unfit. Kindness has disappeared from them all, not even one is good.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Their words release a stench, like the smell of death—foul and filthy! Deceitful lies roll off their tongues. The venom of a viper drips from their lips.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Bitter profanity flows from their mouths, only meant to cut and harm.</verse>
				<verse number="15">They are infatuated with violence and murder.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They release ruin and misery wherever they go.</verse>
				<verse number="17">They never experience the path of peace.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They shut their eyes to the awe-inspiring God!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now, we realize that everything the law says is addressed to those who are under its authority. This is for two reasons: So that every excuse will be silenced, with no boasting of innocence. And so that the entire world will be held accountable to God’s standards.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For by the merit of observing the law no one earns the status of being declared righteous before God, for it is the law that fully exposes and unmasks the reality of sin.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But now, independently of the law, the righteousness of God is tangible and brought to light through Jesus, the Anointed One. This is the righteousness that the Scriptures prophesied would come. It is God’s righteousness made visible through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ. And now all who believe in him receive that gift. For there is really no difference between us,</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23">for we all have sinned and are in need of the glory of God.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Yet through his powerful declaration of acquittal, God freely gives away his righteousness. His gift of love and favor now cascades over us, all because Jesus, the Anointed One, has liberated us from the guilt, punishment, and power of sin!</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus’ God-given destiny was to be the sacrifice to take away sins, and now he is our mercy seat because of his death on the cross. We come to him for mercy, for God has made a provision for us to be forgiven by faith in the sacred blood of Jesus. This is the perfect demonstration of God’s justice, because until now, he had been so patient—holding back his justice out of his tolerance for us. So he covered over the sins of those who lived prior to Jesus’ sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And when the season of tolerance came to an end, there was only one possible way for God to give away his righteousness and still be true to both his justice and his mercy—to offer up his own Son. So now, because we stand on the faithfulness of Jesus, God declares us righteous in his eyes!</verse>
				<verse number="27">Where, then, is there room for boasting? Do our works bring God’s acceptance? Not at all! It was not our works of keeping the law but our faith in his finished work that makes us right with God.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So our conclusion is this: God’s wonderful declaration that we are righteous in his eyes can only come when we put our faith in Christ, and not in keeping the law.</verse>
				<verse number="29">After all, is God the God of the Jews only, or is he equally the God for all of humanity? Of course, he’s the God of all people!</verse>
				<verse number="30">Since there is only one God, he will treat us all the same—he eliminates our guilt and makes us right with him by faith no matter who we are.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Does emphasizing our faith invalidate the law? Absolutely not. Instead, our faith establishes the role the law should rightfully have.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Let me use Abraham as an example. It is clear that humanly speaking, he was the founder of Judaism. What was his experience of being made right with God?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Was it by his good works of keeping the law? No. For if it was by the things he did, he would have something to boast about, but no one boasts before God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Listen to what the Scriptures say: Because Abraham believed God’s words, his faith transferred God’s righteousness into his account.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When people work, they earn wages. It can’t be considered a free gift, because they earned it.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But no one earns God’s righteousness. It can only be transferred when we no longer rely on our own works, but believe in the one who powerfully declares the ungodly to be righteous in his eyes. It is faith that transfers God’s righteousness into your account!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Even King David himself speaks to us regarding the complete wholeness that comes inside a person when God’s powerful declaration of righteousness is heard over our life. Apart from our works, God’s work is enough.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Here’s what David says: What happy fulfillment is ahead for those whose rebellion has been forgiven and whose sins are covered by blood.</verse>
				<verse number="8">What happy progress comes to them when they hear the Lord speak over them, “I will never hold your sins against you!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now, think about it. Does this happiness come only to the Jews, or is it available to all who believe? Our answer is this: faith was credited to Abraham as God’s righteousness!</verse>
				<verse number="10">How did he receive this gift of righteousness? Was he circumcised at the time God accepted him, or was he still uncircumcised? Clearly, he was an uncircumcised gentile when God said this of him!</verse>
				<verse number="11">It was later that he received the external sign of circumcision as a seal to confirm that God had already transferred his righteousness to him by faith, while he was still uncircumcised. So now this qualifies him to become the father of all who believe among the non-Jewish people. And like their “father of faith,” Abraham, God also transfers his righteousness to them by faith.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Yes, Abraham is obviously the true father of faith for the Jewish people who are not only circumcised but who walk in the way of faith that our father Abraham displayed before his circumcision.</verse>
				<verse number="13">God promised Abraham and his descendants that they would have an heir who would reign over the world. This royal promise was not fulfilled because Abraham kept all the law, but through the righteousness that was transferred by faith.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For if keeping the law earns the inheritance, then faith is robbed of its power and the promise becomes useless.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For the law provokes punishment, and where no law exists there cannot be a violation of the law.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The promise depends on faith so that it can be experienced as a grace-gift, and now it extends to all the descendants of Abraham. This promise is not only meant for those who obey the law, but also to those who enter into the faith of Abraham, the father of us all.</verse>
				<verse number="17">That’s what the Scripture means when it says: “I have made you the father of many nations.” He is our example and father, for in God’s presence he believed that God can raise the dead and call into being things that don’t even exist yet.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Against all odds, when it looked hopeless, Abraham believed the promise and expected God to fulfill it. He took God at his word, and as a result he became the father of many nations. God’s declaration over him came to pass: “Your descendants will be so many that they will be impossible to count!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">In spite of being nearly one hundred years old when the promise of having a son was made, his faith was so strong that it could not be undermined by the fact that he and Sarah were incapable of conceiving a child.</verse>
				<verse number="20">He never stopped believing God’s promise, for he was made strong in his faith to father a child. And because he was mighty in faith and convinced that God had all the power needed to fulfill his promises, Abraham glorified God!</verse>
				<verse number="21"></verse>
				<verse number="22">So now you can see why Abraham’s faith was credited to his account as righteousness before God.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And this declaration was not just spoken over Abraham,</verse>
				<verse number="24">but also over us. For when we believe and embrace the one who brought our Lord Jesus back to life, perfect righteousness will be credited to our account as well.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus was handed over to be crucified for the forgiveness of our sins and was raised back to life to prove that he had made us right with God!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Our faith in Jesus transfers God’s righteousness to us and he now declares us flawless in his eyes. This means we can now enjoy true and lasting peace with God, all because of what our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, has done for us.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Our faith guarantees us permanent access into this marvelous kindness that has given us a perfect relationship with God. What incredible joy bursts forth within us as we keep on celebrating our hope of experiencing God’s glory!</verse>
				<verse number="3">But that’s not all! Even in times of trouble we have a joyful confidence, knowing that our pressures will develop in us patient endurance.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And patient endurance will refine our character, and proven character leads us back to hope.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And this hope is not a disappointing fantasy, because we can now experience the endless love of God cascading into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who lives in us!</verse>
				<verse number="6">For when the time was right, the Anointed One came and died to demonstrate his love for sinners who were entirely helpless, weak, and powerless to save themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now, would anyone dare to die for the sake of a wicked person? We can all understand if someone was willing to die for a truly noble person.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But Christ proved God’s passionate love for us by dying in our place while we were still lost and ungodly!</verse>
				<verse number="9">And there is still much more to say of his unfailing love for us! For through the blood of Jesus we have heard the powerful declaration, “You are now righteous in my sight.” And because of the sacrifice of Jesus, you will never experience the wrath of God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So if while we were still enemies, God fully reconciled us to himself through the death of his Son, then something greater than friendship is ours. Now that we are at peace with God, and because we share in his resurrection life, how much more we will be rescued from sin’s dominion!</verse>
				<verse number="11">And even more than that, we overflow with triumphant joy in our new relationship of living reconciled to God—all because of Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="12">When Adam sinned, the entire world was affected. Sin entered human experience, and death was the result. And so death followed this sin, casting its shadow over all humanity, because all have sinned.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Sin was in the world before Moses gave the written law, but it was not charged against them where no law existed.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yet death reigned as king from Adam to Moses even though they hadn’t broken a command the way Adam had. The first man, Adam, was a picture of the Messiah, who was to come.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Now, there is no comparison between Adam’s transgression and the gracious gift that we experience. For the magnitude of the gift far outweighs the crime. It’s true that many died because of one man’s transgression, but how much greater will God’s grace and his gracious gift of acceptance overflow to many because of what one man, Jesus, the Messiah, did for us!</verse>
				<verse number="16">And this free-flowing gift imparts to us much more than what was given to us through the one who sinned. For because of one transgression, we are all facing a death sentence with a verdict of “Guilty!” But this gracious gift leaves us free from our many failures and brings us into the perfect righteousness of God—acquitted with the words “Not guilty!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Death once held us in its grip, and by the blunder of one man, death reigned as king over humanity. But now, how much more are we held in the grip of grace and continue reigning as kings in life, enjoying our regal freedom through the gift of perfect righteousness in the one and only Jesus, the Messiah!</verse>
				<verse number="18">In other words, just as condemnation came upon all people through one transgression, so through one righteous act of Jesus’ sacrifice, the perfect righteousness that makes us right with God and leads us to a victorious life is now available to all.</verse>
				<verse number="19">One man’s disobedience opened the door for all humanity to become sinners. So also one man’s obedience opened the door for many to be made perfectly right with God and acceptable to him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So then, the law was introduced into God’s plan to bring the reality of human sinfulness out of hiding. And yet, wherever sin increased, there was more than enough of God’s grace to triumph all the more!</verse>
				<verse number="21">And just as sin reigned through death, so also this sin-conquering grace will reign as king through righteousness, imparting eternal life through Jesus, our Lord and Messiah!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">So what do we do, then? Do we persist in sin so that God’s kindness and grace will increase?</verse>
				<verse number="2">What a terrible thought! We have died to sin once and for all, as a dead man passes away from this life. So how could we live under sin’s rule a moment longer?</verse>
				<verse number="3">Or have you forgotten that all of us who were immersed into union with Jesus, the Anointed One, were immersed into union with his death?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Sharing in his death by our baptism means that we were co-buried with him, so that when the Father’s glory raised Christ from the dead, we were also raised with him. We have been co-resurrected with him so that we could be empowered to walk in the freshness of new life.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For since we are permanently grafted into him to experience a death like his, then we are permanently grafted into him to experience a resurrection like his and the new life that it imparts.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Could it be any clearer that our former identity is now and forever deprived of its power? For we were co-crucified with him to dismantle the stronghold of sin within us, so that we would not continue to live one moment longer submitted to sin’s power.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Obviously, a dead person is incapable of sinning.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And if we were co-crucified with the Anointed One, we know that we will also share in the fullness of his life.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And we know that since the Anointed One has been raised from the dead to die no more, his resurrection life has vanquished death and its power over him is finished.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For by his sacrifice he died to sin’s power once and for all, but he now lives continuously for the Father’s pleasure.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So let it be the same way with you! Since you are now joined with him, you must continually view yourselves as dead and unresponsive to sin’s appeal while living daily for God’s pleasure in union with Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Sin is a dethroned monarch; so you must no longer give it an opportunity to rule over your life, controlling how you live and compelling you to obey its desires and cravings.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So then, refuse to answer its call to surrender your body as a tool for wickedness. Instead, passionately answer God’s call to keep yielding your body to him as one who has now experienced resurrection life! You live now for his pleasure, ready to be used for his noble purpose.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Remember this: sin will not conquer you, for God already has! You are not governed by law but governed by the reign of the grace of God.</verse>
				<verse number="15">What are we to do, then? Should we sin to our hearts’ content since there’s no law to condemn us anymore? What a terrible thought!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Don’t you realize that grace frees you to choose your own master? But choose carefully, for you surrender yourself to become a servant—bound to the one you choose to obey. If you choose to love sin, it will become your master, and it will own you and reward you with death. But if you choose to love and obey God, he will lead you into perfect righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And thanks be to God, for in the past you were servants of sin, but now your obedience is heart deep, and your life is being molded by truth through the teaching you are devoted to.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And now you celebrate your freedom from your former master—sin. You’ve left its bondage, and now God’s perfect righteousness holds power over you as his loving servants.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I’ve used the familiar terms of a “servant” and a “master” to compensate for your weakness to understand. For just as you surrendered your bodies and souls to impurity and lawlessness, which only brought more lawlessness into your lives, so now surrender yourselves as servants of righteousness, which brings you deeper into true holiness.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For when you were bound as servants to sin, you lived your lives free from any obligation to righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So tell me, what benefit ensued from doing those things that you’re now ashamed of? It left you with nothing but a legacy of shame and death.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But now, as God’s loving servants, you live in joyous freedom from the power of sin. So consider the benefits you now enjoy—you are brought deeper into the experience of true holiness that ends with eternal life!</verse>
				<verse number="23">For sin’s meager wages is death, but God’s lavish gift is life eternal, found in your union with our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">I write to you, dear brothers and sisters, who are familiar with the law. Don’t you know that when a person dies, it ends his obligation to the law?</verse>
				<verse number="2">For example, a married couple is bound by the law to remain together until separated by death. But when one spouse dies, the other is released from the law of the marriage.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So then if a wife is joined to another man while still married, she commits adultery. But if her husband dies, she is obviously free from the marriage contract and may marry another man without being charged with adultery.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So, my dear brothers and sisters, the same principle applies to your relationship with God. For you died to your first husband, the law, by being co-crucified with the body of the Messiah. So you are now free to “marry” another—the one who was raised from the dead so that you may now bear spiritual fruit for God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When we were merely living natural lives, the law, through defining sin, actually awakened sinful desires within us, which resulted in bearing the fruit of death.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But now that we have been fully released from the power of the law, we are dead to what once controlled us. And our lives are no longer motivated by the obsolete way of following the written code, so that now we may serve God by living in the freshness of a new life in the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So, what shall we say about all this? Am I suggesting that the law is sinful? Of course not! In fact, it was the law that gave us the clear definition of sin. For example, when the law said, “Do not covet,” it became the catalyst to see how wrong it was for me to crave what belongs to someone else.</verse>
				<verse number="8">It was through God’s commandment that sin was awakened in me and built its base of operation within me to stir up every kind of wrong desire. For in the absence of the law, sin hides dormant.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I once lived without a clear understanding of the law, but when I heard God’s commandments, sin sprang to life and brought with it a death sentence. The commandment that was intended to bring life brought me death instead.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">Sin, by means of the commandment, built a base of operation within me, to overpower me and put me to death.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So then, we have to conclude that the problem is not with the law itself, for the law is holy and its commandments are correct and for our good.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So, did something meant to be good become death to me? Certainly not! It was not the law but sin unmasked that produced my spiritual death. The sacred commandment merely uncovered the evil of sin so it could be seen for what it is.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For we know that the law is divinely inspired and comes from the spiritual realm, but I am a human being made of flesh and trafficked as a slave under sin’s authority.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I’m a mystery to myself, for I want to do what is right, but end up doing what my moral instincts condemn.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And if my behavior is not in line with my desire, my conscience still confirms the excellence of the law.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And now I realize that it is no longer my true self doing it, but the unwelcome intruder of sin in my humanity.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For I know that nothing good lives within the flesh of my fallen humanity. The longings to do what is right are within me, but willpower is not enough to accomplish it.</verse>
				<verse number="19">My lofty desires to do what is good are dashed when I do the things I want to avoid.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So if my behavior contradicts my desires to do good, I must conclude that it’s not my true identity doing it, but the unwelcome intruder of sin hindering me from being who I really am.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Through my experience of this principle, I discover that even when I want to do good, evil is ready to sabotage me.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Truly, deep within my true identity, I love to do what pleases God.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But I discern another power operating in my humanity, waging a war against the moral principles of my conscience and bringing me into captivity as a prisoner to the “law” of sin—this unwelcome intruder in my humanity.</verse>
				<verse number="24">What an agonizing situation I am in! So who has the power to rescue this miserable man from the unwelcome intruder of sin and death?</verse>
				<verse number="25">I give all my thanks to God, for his mighty power has finally provided a way out through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One! So if left to myself, the flesh is aligned with the law of sin, but now my renewed mind is fixed on and submitted to God’s righteous principles.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">So now the case is closed. There remains no accusing voice of condemnation against those who are joined in life-union with Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For the “law” of the Spirit of life flowing through the anointing of Jesus has liberated us from the “law” of sin and death.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For God achieved what the law was unable to accomplish, because the law was limited by the weakness of human nature. Yet God sent us his Son in human form to identify with human weakness. Clothed with humanity, God’s Son gave his body to be the sin-offering so that God could once and for all condemn the guilt and power of sin.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So now every righteous requirement of the law can be fulfilled through the Anointed One living his life in us. And we are free to live, not according to our flesh, but by the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Those who are motivated by the flesh only pursue what benefits themselves. But those who live by the impulses of the Holy Spirit are motivated to pursue spiritual realities.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For the sense and reason of the flesh is death, but the mind-set controlled by the Spirit finds life and peace.</verse>
				<verse number="7">In fact, the mind-set focused on the flesh fights God’s plan and refuses to submit to his direction, because it cannot!</verse>
				<verse number="8">For no matter how hard they try, God finds no pleasure with those who are controlled by the flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But when the Spirit of Christ empowers your life, you are not dominated by the flesh but by the Spirit. And if you are not joined to the Spirit of the Anointed One, you are not of him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now Christ lives his life in you! And even though your body may be dead because of the effects of sin, his life-giving Spirit imparts life to you because you are fully accepted by God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yes, God raised Jesus to life! And since God’s Spirit of Resurrection lives in you, he will also raise your dying body to life by the same Spirit that breathes life into you!</verse>
				<verse number="12">So then, beloved ones, the flesh has no claims on us at all, and we have no further obligation to live in obedience to it.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For when you live controlled by the flesh, you are about to die. But if the life of the Spirit puts to death the corrupt ways of the flesh, we then taste his abundant life.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The mature children of God are those who are moved by the impulses of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And you did not receive the “spirit of religious duty,” leading you back into the fear of never being good enough. But you have received the “Spirit of full acceptance,” enfolding you into the family of God. And you will never feel orphaned, for as he rises up within us, our spirits join him in saying the words of tender affection, “Beloved Father!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">For the Holy Spirit makes God’s fatherhood real to us as he whispers into our innermost being, “You are God’s beloved child!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">And since we are his true children, we qualify to share all his treasures, for indeed, we are heirs of God himself. And since we are joined to Christ, we also inherit all that he is and all that he has. We will experience being co-glorified with him provided that we accept his sufferings as our own.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I am convinced that any suffering we endure is less than nothing compared to the magnitude of glory that is about to be unveiled within us.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The entire universe is standing on tiptoe, yearning to see the unveiling of God’s glorious sons and daughters!</verse>
				<verse number="20">For against its will the universe itself has had to endure the empty futility resulting from the consequences of human sin. But now, with eager expectation,</verse>
				<verse number="21">all creation longs for freedom from its slavery to decay and to experience with us the wonderful freedom coming to God’s children.</verse>
				<verse number="22">To this day we are aware of the universal agony and groaning of creation, as if it were in the contractions of labor for childbirth.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And it’s not just creation. We who have already experienced the firstfruits of the Spirit also inwardly groan as we passionately long to experience our full status as God’s sons and daughters—including our physical bodies being transformed.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For this is the hope of our salvation. But hope means that we must trust and wait for what is still unseen. For why would we need to hope for something we already have?</verse>
				<verse number="25">So because our hope is set on what is yet to be seen, we patiently keep on waiting for its fulfillment.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And in a similar way, the Holy Spirit takes hold of us in our human frailty to empower us in our weakness. For example, at times we don’t even know how to pray, or know the best things to ask for. But the Holy Spirit rises up within us to super-intercede on our behalf, pleading to God with emotional sighs too deep for words.</verse>
				<verse number="27">God, the searcher of the heart, knows fully our longings, yet he also understands the desires of the Spirit, because the Holy Spirit passionately pleads before God for us, his holy ones, in perfect harmony with God’s plan and our destiny.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So we are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together for good, for we are his lovers who have been called to fulfill his designed purpose.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For he knew all about us before we were born and he destined us from the beginning to share the likeness of his Son. This means the Son is the oldest among a vast family of brothers and sisters who will become just like him.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Having determined our destiny ahead of time, he called us to himself and transferred his perfect righteousness to everyone he called. And those who possess his perfect righteousness he co-glorified with his Son!</verse>
				<verse number="31">So, what does all this mean? If God has determined to stand with us, tell me, who then could ever stand against us?</verse>
				<verse number="32">For God has proved his love by giving us his greatest treasure, the gift of his Son. And since God freely offered him up as the sacrifice for us all, he certainly won’t withhold from us anything else he has to give.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Who then would dare to accuse those whom God has chosen in love to be his? God himself is the judge who has issued his final verdict over them—“Not guilty!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Who then is left to condemn us? Certainly not Jesus, the Anointed One! For he gave his life for us, and even more than that, he has conquered death and is now risen, exalted, and enthroned by God at his right hand. So how could he possibly condemn us since he is continually praying for our triumph?</verse>
				<verse number="35">Who could ever divorce us from the endless love of God’s Anointed One? Absolutely no one! For nothing in the universe has the power to diminish his love toward us. Troubles, pressures, and problems are unable to come between us and heaven’s love. What about persecutions, deprivations, dangers, and death threats? No, for they are all impotent to hinder omnipotent love,</verse>
				<verse number="36">even though it is written: All day long we face death threats for your sake, God. We are considered to be nothing more than sheep to be slaughtered!</verse>
				<verse number="37">Yet even in the midst of all these things, we triumph over them all, for God has made us to be more than conquerors, and his demonstrated love is our glorious victory over everything!</verse>
				<verse number="38">So now I live with the confidence that there is nothing in the universe with the power to separate us from God’s love. I’m convinced that his love will triumph over death, life’s troubles, fallen angels, or dark rulers in the heavens. There is nothing in our present or future circumstances that can weaken his love.</verse>
				<verse number="39">There is no power above us or beneath us—no power that could ever be found in the universe that can distance us from God’s passionate love, which is lavished upon us through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">O Israel, my Jewish family, I feel such great sorrow and heartache for you that never leaves me! God knows these deep feelings within me as I long for you to come to faith in the Anointed One. My conscience will not let me speak anything but the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">For my grief is so intense that I wish that I would be accursed, cut off from the Messiah, if it would mean that you, my people, would come to faith in him! You are Israelites, my fellow citizens, and God’s chosen people. To you belong God’s glorious presence, the covenants, the Torah, the temple with its required sacrifices, and the promises of God.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">We trace our beginnings back to the patriarchs, and through their bloodline is the genealogy of the Messiah, who is God over everything. May he be praised through endless ages! Amen!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Clearly, God has not failed to fulfill his promises to Israel, for that will never happen! But not everyone who has descended from Israel belongs to Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Physical descent from Abraham doesn’t guarantee the inheritance, because God has said: “Through Isaac your descendants will be counted as part of your lineage.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">This confirms that it is not merely the natural offspring of Abraham who are considered the children of God; rather, the children born because of God’s promise are counted as descendants.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For God promised Abraham: “Now is the time! For in nine months your wife, Sarah, will have a son!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now, this son was our ancestor, Isaac, who, with his wife, Rebekah, conceived twins.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And before her twin sons were born, God spoke to Rebekah and said: “The oldest will serve the youngest.” God spoke these words before the sons had done anything good or bad, which proves that God calls people not on the basis of their good or bad works, but according to his divine purpose.</verse>
				<verse number="12"></verse>
				<verse number="13">For in the words of Scripture: “Jacob I have chosen, but Esau I have rejected.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">So, what does all this mean? Are we saying that God is unfair? Of course not!</verse>
				<verse number="15">He had every right to say to Moses: “I will be merciful to whomever I choose and I will show compassion to whomever I wish.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Again, this proves that God’s choice doesn’t depend on how badly someone wants it or tries to earn it, but it depends on God’s kindness and mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For just as God said to Pharaoh: “I raised you up as ruler of Egypt for this reason, that I might make you an example of how I demonstrate my miracle power. For by the example of how I deal with you, my powerful name will be a message proclaimed throughout the earth!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">So again we see that it is entirely up to God to show mercy or to harden the hearts of whomever he chooses.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Well then, one might ask, “If God is in complete control, how could he blame us? For who can resist whatever he wants done?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">But who do you think you are to second-guess God? How could a human being molded out of clay say to the one who molded him, “Why in the world did you make me this way?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Or are you denying the right of the potter to make out of clay whatever he wants? Doesn’t the potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay an elegant vase or an ordinary pot?</verse>
				<verse number="22">And in the same way, although God has every right to unleash his anger and demonstrate his power, yet he is extremely patient with those who deserve wrath—vessels prepared for destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And doesn’t he also have the right to release the revelation of the wealth of his glory to his vessels of mercy, whom God prepared beforehand to receive his glory?</verse>
				<verse number="24">Even for us, whether we are Jews or non-Jews, we are those he has called to experience his glory.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Remember the prophecy God gave in Hosea: “To those who were rejected and not my people, I will say to them: ‘You are mine.’ And to those who were unloved I will say: ‘You are my darling.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="26">And: “In the place where they were told, ‘You are nobody,’ this will be the very place where they will be renamed ‘Children of the living God.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="27">And the prophet Isaiah cries out to Israel: Though the children of Israel are as many as the sands of the seashore, only a remnant will be saved.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For the Lord will act and carry out his word on the earth, and waste no time to accomplish it!</verse>
				<verse number="29">Just as Isaiah saw it coming and prophesied: If the Lord God had not left us a remnant, we would have been destroyed like Sodom and left desolate like Gomorrah!</verse>
				<verse number="30">So then, what does all this mean? Here’s the irony: The non-Jewish people, who weren’t even pursuing righteousness, were the ones who seized it—a perfect righteousness that is transferred by faith.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Yet Israel, even though pursuing a legal righteousness, did not attain to it.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And why was that? Because they did not pursue the path of faith but insisted on pursuing righteousness by works, as if it could be seized another way. They were offended by the means of obtaining it and stumbled over the stumbling stone,</verse>
				<verse number="33">just as it is written: “Be careful! I am setting in Zion a stone that will cause people to stumble, a rock of offense that will make them fall, but believers in him will not experience shame.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">My beloved brothers and sisters, the passionate desire of my heart and constant prayer to God is for my fellow Israelites to experience salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For I know that although they are deeply devoted to God, they are unenlightened.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And since they’ve ignored the righteousness God gives, wanting instead to be acceptable to God because of their own works, they’ve refused to submit to God’s faith-righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For Christ is the end of the law. And because of him, God has transferred his perfect righteousness to all who believe.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Moses wrote long ago about the need to obey every part of the law in order to be declared right with God: “The one who obeys these things must always live by them.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">But we receive the faith-righteousness that speaks an entirely different message: “Don’t for a moment think you need to climb into the heavens to find the Messiah and bring him down,</verse>
				<verse number="7">or to descend into the underworld to bring him up from the dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But the faith-righteousness we receive speaks to us in these words of Moses: “God’s living message is very close to you, as close as your own heart beating in your chest and as near as the tongue in your mouth.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">And what is God’s “living message”? It is the revelation of faith for salvation, which is the message that we preach. For if you publicly declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will experience salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The heart that believes in him receives the gift of the righteousness of God—and then the mouth confesses, resulting in salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For the Scriptures encourage us with these words: “Everyone who believes in him will never be disappointed.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">So then faith eliminates the distinction between Jew and non-Jew, for he is the same Lord for all people. And he has enough treasures to lavish generously upon all who call on him.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And it’s true: “Everyone who calls on the Lord’s name will experience new life.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">But how can people call on him for help if they’ve not yet believed? And how can they believe in one they’ve not yet heard of? And how can they hear the message of life if there is no one there to proclaim it?</verse>
				<verse number="15">And how can the message be proclaimed if messengers have yet to be sent? That’s why the Scriptures say: How welcome is the arrival of those proclaiming the joyful news of peace and of good things to come!</verse>
				<verse number="16">But not everyone welcomes the good news, as Isaiah said: Lord, is there anyone who hears and believes our message?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Faith, then, is birthed in a heart that responds to God’s anointed utterance of the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Can it be that Israel hasn’t heard the message? No, they have heard it, for: The voice has been heard throughout the world, and its message has gone to the ends of the earth!</verse>
				<verse number="19">So again I ask, didn’t Israel already understand that God’s message was for others as well as for themselves? Yes, they certainly did understand, for Moses was the first to state it: “I will make you jealous of a people who are ‘nobodies.’ And I will use people with no understanding to provoke you to anger.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">And Isaiah the fearless prophet dared to declare: “Those who found me weren’t even seeking me. I manifested myself before those who weren’t even asking to know me!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Yet regarding Israel Isaiah says: “With love I have held out my hands day after day, offering myself to this unbelieving and stubborn people!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">So then I ask you this question: did God really push aside and reject his people? Absolutely not! For I myself am a Jew, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
				<verse number="2">God has not rejected his chosen, destined people! Haven’t you heard Elijah’s testimony in the Scriptures, and how he prays to God, agonizing over Israel?</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Lord, they’ve murdered your prophets; they’ve demolished your altars. Now I’m the only one left and they want to kill me!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">But what was the revelation God spoke to him in response? “ You are not alone. For I have preserved a remnant for myself—seven thousand others who are faithful and have refused to worship Baal.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">And that is but one example of what God is doing in this age of fulfillment, for God’s grace empowers his chosen remnant.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And since it is by God’s grace, it can’t be a matter of their good works; otherwise, it wouldn’t be a gift of grace, but earned by human effort.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So then, Israel failed to achieve what it had strived for, but the divinely chosen remnant receives it by grace, while the rest were hardened and unable to receive the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Just as it is written: God granted them a spirit of deep slumber. He closed their eyes to the truth and prevented their ears from hearing up to this very day.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And King David also prophesied this: May their table prove to be a snare and a trap to cause their ruin. Bring them the retribution they deserve.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Blindfold their eyes and don’t let them see. Let them be stooped over continually.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So, am I saying that Israel stumbled so badly that they will never get back up? Certainly not! Rather, it was because of their stumble that salvation now extends to all the non-Jewish people, in order to make Israel jealous and desire the very things that God has freely given them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So if all the world is being greatly enriched through their failure, and through their fall great spiritual wealth is given to the non-Jewish people, imagine how much more will Israel’s awakening bring to us all!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now, I speak to you who are not Jewish, since I am an apostle to reach the non-Jewish people. And I draw attention to this ministry as much as I can when I am among the Jews,</verse>
				<verse number="14">hoping to make them jealous of what God has given to those who are not Jews, winning some of my people to salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For if their temporary rejection released the reconciling power of grace into the world, what will happen when Israel is reinstated and reconciled to God? It will unleash resurrection power throughout the whole earth!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Since Abraham and the patriarchs are consecrated and set apart for God, so also will their descendants be set apart. If the roots of a tree are holy and set apart for God, so too will be the branches.</verse>
				<verse number="17">However, some of the branches have been pruned away. And you, who were once nothing more than a wild olive branch, God has grafted in—inserting you among the remaining branches as a joint partner to share in the wonderful richness of the cultivated olive stem.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So don’t be so arrogant as to believe that you are superior to the natural branches. There’s no reason to boast, for the new branches don’t support the root, but you owe your life to the root that supports you!</verse>
				<verse number="19">You might begin to think that some branches were pruned or broken off just to make room for you.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yes, that’s true. They were removed because of their unbelief. But remember this: you are only attached by your faith. So don’t be presumptuous, but stand in awe and reverence.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Since God didn’t spare the natural branches that fell into unbelief, perhaps he won’t spare you either!</verse>
				<verse number="22">So fix your gaze on the simultaneous kindness and strict justice of God. How severely he treated those who fell into unbelief! Yet how tender and kind is his relationship with you. So keep on trusting in his kindness; otherwise, you also will be cut off.</verse>
				<verse number="23">God is more than ready to graft back in the natural branches when they turn from clinging to their unbelief to embracing faith.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For if God grafted you in, even though you were taken from what is by nature a wild olive tree, how much more can he reconnect the natural branches by inserting them back into their own cultivated olive tree!</verse>
				<verse number="25">My beloved brothers and sisters, I want to share with you a mystery concerning Israel’s future. For understanding this mystery will keep you from thinking you already know everything. A partial and temporary hardening to the gospel has come over Israel, which will last until the full number of non-Jews has come into God’s family.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And then God will bring all of Israel to salvation! The prophecy will be fulfilled that says: “Coming from Zion will be the Savior, and he will turn Jacob away from evil.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For this is my covenant promise with them when I forgive their sins.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Now, many of the Jews are opposed to the gospel, but their opposition has opened the door of the gospel to you who are not Jewish. Yet they are still greatly loved by God because their ancestors were divinely chosen to be his.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And when God chooses someone and graciously imparts gifts to him, they are never rescinded.</verse>
				<verse number="30">You who are not Jews were once rebels against God, but now, because of their disobedience, you have experienced God’s tender mercies.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And now they are the rebels, and because of God’s tender mercies to you, you can open the door to them to share in and enjoy what God has given to us!</verse>
				<verse number="32">Actually, God considers all of humanity to be prisoners of their unbelief, so that he can unlock our hearts and show his tender mercies to all who come to him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Who could ever wrap their minds around the riches of God, the depth of his wisdom, and the marvel of his perfect knowledge? Who could ever explain the wonder of his decisions or search out the mysterious way he carries out his plans?</verse>
				<verse number="34">For who has discovered how the Lord thinks or is wise enough to be the one to advise him in his plans?</verse>
				<verse number="35">Or: “Who has ever first given something to God that obligates God to owe him something in return?”</verse>
				<verse number="36">For out of him, the sustainer of everything, came everything, and now everything finds fulfillment in him. May all praise and honor be given to him forever! Amen!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Beloved friends, what should be our proper response to God’s marvelous mercies? To surrender yourselves to God to be his sacred, living sacrifices. And live in holiness, experiencing all that delights his heart. For this becomes your genuine expression of worship.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Stop imitating the ideals and opinions of the culture around you, but be inwardly transformed by the Holy Spirit through a total reformation of how you think. This will empower you to discern God’s will as you live a beautiful life, satisfying and perfect in his eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="3">God has given me grace to speak a warning about pride. I would ask each of you to be emptied of self-promotion and not create a false image of your importance. Instead, honestly assess your worth by using your God-given faith as the standard of measurement, and then you will see your true value with an appropriate self-esteem.</verse>
				<verse number="4">In the human body there are many parts and organs, each with a unique function.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And so it is in the body of Christ. For though we are many, we’ve all been mingled into one body in Christ. This means that we are all vitally joined to one another, with each contributing to the others.</verse>
				<verse number="6">God’s marvelous grace imparts to each one of us varying gifts. So if God has given you the grace-gift of prophecy, activate your gift by using the proportion of faith you have to prophesy.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If your grace-gift is serving, then thrive in serving others well. If you have the grace-gift of teaching, then be actively teaching and training others.</verse>
				<verse number="8">If you have the grace-gift of encouragement, then use it often to encourage others. If you have the grace-gift of giving to meet the needs of others, then may you prosper in your generosity without any fanfare. If you have the gift of leadership, be passionate about your leadership. And if you have the gift of showing compassion, then flourish in your cheerful display of compassion.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Let the inner movement of your heart always be to love one another, and never play the role of an actor wearing a mask. Despise evil and embrace everything that is good and virtuous.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Be devoted to tenderly loving your fellow believers as members of one family. Try to outdo yourselves in respect and honor of one another.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Be enthusiastic to serve the Lord, keeping your passion toward him boiling hot! Radiate with the glow of the Holy Spirit and let him fill you with excitement as you serve him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Let this hope burst forth within you, releasing a continual joy. Don’t give up in a time of trouble, but commune with God at all times.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Take a constant interest in the needs of God’s beloved people and respond by helping them. And eagerly welcome people as guests into your home.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Speak blessing, not cursing, over those who reject and persecute you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Celebrate with those who celebrate, and weep with those who grieve.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Live happily together in a spirit of harmony, and be as mindful of another’s worth as you are your own. Don’t live with a lofty mind-set, thinking you are too important to serve others, but be willing to do menial tasks and identify with those who are humble minded. Don’t be smug or even think for a moment that you know it all.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Never hold a grudge or try to get even, but plan your life around the noblest way to benefit others.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Do your best to live as everybody’s friend.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Beloved, don’t be obsessed with taking revenge, but leave that to God’s righteous justice. For the Scriptures say: “Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,” says the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And: If your enemy is hungry, buy him lunch! Win him over with kindness. For your surprising generosity will awaken his conscience, and God will reward you with favor.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Never let evil defeat you, but defeat evil with good.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Every person must submit to and support the authorities over him. For there can be no authority in the universe except by God’s appointment, which means that every authority that exists has been instituted by God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So to resist authority is to resist the divine order of God, which results in severe consequences.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For civil authorities don’t intimidate those who are doing good, but those who are doing evil. So do what is right and you’ll never need to fear those in authority. They will commend you for your good citizenship.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Those in authority are God’s servants for the good of society. But if you break the law, you have reason to be alarmed, for they are God’s agents of punishment to bring criminals to justice. Why do you think they carry weapons?</verse>
				<verse number="5">You are compelled to obey them, not just to avoid punishment, but because you want to live with a clean conscience.</verse>
				<verse number="6">This is also the reason you pay your taxes, for governmental authorities are God’s officials who oversee these things.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So it is your duty to pay all the taxes and fees that they require and to respect those who are worthy of respect, honoring them accordingly.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Don’t owe anything to anyone, except your outstanding debt to continually love one another, for the one who learns to love has fulfilled every requirement of the law.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For the commandments, “Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not covet,” and every other commandment can be summed up in these words: “Love and value others the same way you love and value yourself.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Love makes it impossible to harm another, so love fulfills all that the law requires.</verse>
				<verse number="11">To live like this is all the more urgent, for time is running out and you know it is a strategic hour in human history. It is time for us to wake up! For our full salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Night’s darkness is dissolving away as a new day of destiny dawns. So we must once and for all strip away what is done in the shadows of darkness, removing it like filthy clothes. And once and for all we clothe ourselves with the radiance of light as our weapon.</verse>
				<verse number="13">We must live honorably, surrounded by the light of this new day, not in the darkness of drunkenness and debauchery, not in promiscuity and sensuality, not being argumentative or jealous of others.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Instead fully immerse yourselves into the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, and don’t waste even a moment’s thought on your former identity to awaken its selfish desires.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">Offer an open hand of fellowship to welcome every true believer, even though their faith may be weak and immature. And refuse to engage in debates with them concerning nothing more than opinions.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For example, one believer has no problem with eating all kinds of food, but another with weaker faith will eat only vegetables.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The one who eats freely shouldn’t judge and look down on the one who eats only vegetables. And the vegetarian must not judge and look down on the one who eats everything. Remember, God has welcomed him and taken him as his partner.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Who do you think you are to sit in judgment of someone else’s household servant? His own master is the one to evaluate whether he succeeds or fails. And God’s servants will succeed, for God’s power supports them and enables them to stand.</verse>
				<verse number="5">In the same way, one person regards a certain day as more sacred than another, and another person regards them all alike. There is nothing wrong with having different personal convictions about such matters.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For the person who observes one day as especially sacred does it to honor the Lord. And the same is true regarding what a person eats. The one who eats everything eats to honor the Lord, because he gives thanks to God, and the one who has a special diet does it to honor the Lord, and he also gives thanks to God.</verse>
				<verse number="7">No one lives to himself and no one dies to himself.</verse>
				<verse number="8">While we live, we must live for our Master, and in death we must bring honor to him. So dead or alive we belong to our Master.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For this very reason the Anointed One died and was brought back to life again, so that he would become the Lord God over both the dead and the living.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Why would you judge your brothers or sisters because of their diet, despising them for what they eat or don’t eat? For we each will have our turn to stand before God’s judgment seat.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Just as it is written: “As surely as I am the Living God, I tell you: ‘Every knee will bow before me and every tongue will confess the truth and glorify me!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Therefore, each one must answer for himself and give a personal account of his own life before God.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So stop being critical and condemning of other believers, but instead determine to never deliberately cause a brother or sister to stumble and fall because of your actions.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I know and am convinced by personal revelation from the Lord Jesus that there is nothing wrong with eating any food. But to the one who considers it to be unclean, it is unacceptable.</verse>
				<verse number="15">If your brother or sister is offended because you insist on eating what you want, it is no longer love that rules your conduct. Why would you wound someone for whom the Messiah gave his life, just so you can eat what you want?</verse>
				<verse number="16">So don’t give people the opportunity to slander what you know to be good.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the kingdom of God is not a matter of rules about food and drink, but is in the realm of the Holy Spirit, filled with righteousness, peace, and joy.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Serving the Anointed One by walking in these kingdom realities pleases God and earns the respect of others.</verse>
				<verse number="19">So then, make it your top priority to live a life of peace with harmony in your relationships, eagerly seeking to strengthen and encourage one another.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Stop ruining the work of God by insisting on your own opinions about food. You can eat anything you want, but it is wrong to deliberately cause someone to be offended over what you eat.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Consider it an act of love to refrain from eating meat or drinking wine or doing anything else that would cause a fellow believer to be offended or tempted to be weakened in his faith.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Keep the convictions you have about these matters between yourself and God, and don’t impose them upon others. You’ll be happy when you don’t judge yourself in doing what your conscience approves.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But the one who has misgivings feels miserable if he eats meat, because he doubts and doesn’t eat in faith. For anything we do that doesn’t spring from faith is, by definition, sinful.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Now, those who are mature in their faith can easily be recognized, for they don’t live to please themselves but have learned to patiently embrace others in their immaturity.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Our goal must be to empower others to do what is right and good for them, and to bring them into spiritual maturity.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For not even the most powerful one of all, the Anointed One, lived to please himself. His life fulfilled the Scripture that says: All the insults of those who insulted you fall upon me.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Whatever was written beforehand is meant to instruct us in how to live. The Scriptures impart to us encouragement and inspiration so that we can live in hope and endure all things.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now may God, the source of great endurance and comfort, grace you with unity among yourselves, which flows from your relationship with Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then, with a unanimous rush of passion, you will with one voice glorify God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You will bring God glory when you accept and welcome one another as partners, just as the Anointed One has fully accepted you and received you as his partner.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I am convinced that Jesus, the Messiah, was sent as a servant to the Jewish people to fulfill the promises God made to our ancestors and to prove God’s faithfulness.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And now, because of Jesus, the non-Jewish people of the world can glorify God for his kindness to them, fulfilling the prophecy of Scripture: Because of this I will proclaim you among the nations and they will hear me sing praises to your name.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And in another place it says: “You who are not Jewish, celebrate life right alongside his Jewish people.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">And again: Praise the Lord, all you who are not Jews, and let all the people of the earth raise their voices in praises to him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And Isaiah prophesied: “An heir to David’s throne will emerge, and he will rise up as ruler over all the non-Jewish nations, for all their hopes will be met in him.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now may God, the fountain of hope, fill you to overflowing with uncontainable joy and perfect peace as you trust in him. And may the power of the Holy Spirit continually surround your life with his super-abundance until you radiate with hope!</verse>
				<verse number="14">My dear brothers and sisters, I am fully convinced of your genuine spirituality. I know that each of you is stuffed full of God’s goodness, that you are richly supplied with all kinds of revelation-knowledge, and that you are empowered to effectively instruct one another.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And because of the outpouring of God’s grace on my life to be his minister and to preach Jesus, the Anointed One, to the non-Jewish people, I have written rather boldly to you on some themes, reminding you of their importance.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For this grace has made me a servant of the gospel of God, constantly doing the work of a priest, for I endeavor to present an acceptable offering to God; so that the non-Jewish people of the earth may be set apart and made holy by the Spirit of holiness.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now then, it is through my union with Jesus Christ, that I enjoy an enthusiasm and confidence in my ministry for God.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And I will not be presumptuous to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me. For many non-Jewish people are coming into faith’s obedience by the power of the Spirit of God, which is displayed through mighty signs and amazing wonders, both in word and deed. Starting from Jerusalem I went from place to place as far as the distant Roman province of Illyricum, fully preaching the wonderful message of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="19"></verse>
				<verse number="20">It is my honor and constant passion to be a pioneer who preaches where no one has ever even heard of the Anointed One, instead of building upon someone else’s foundation.</verse>
				<verse number="21">As the Scriptures say: Those who know nothing about him will clearly see him, and those who have not heard will understand.</verse>
				<verse number="22">My pursuit of this mission has prevented me many times from visiting you,</verse>
				<verse number="23">but there is now nothing left to keep me in these regions. So many years I have longed to come and be with you!</verse>
				<verse number="24">So on my way to Spain I hope to visit you as I pass through Rome. And after I have enjoyed fellowship with you for a while, I hope that you would help me financially on my journey.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But now I’m on my way to Jerusalem to encourage God’s people and minister to them.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I am pleased to inform you that the believers of Macedonia and Greece have made a generous contribution for the poor among the holy believers in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="27">They were thrilled to have an opportunity to give back to the believers in Jerusalem. For indeed, they are deeply grateful for them and feel indebted because they brought them the gospel. Since the ethnic multitudes have shared in the spiritual wealth of the Jewish people, it is only right that the non-Jewish people share their material wealth with them.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So, when I have completed this act of worship and safely delivered the offering to them in Jerusalem, I will set out for Spain and visit you on my way there.</verse>
				<verse number="29">I am convinced that when I come to you, I will come packed full and loaded with the blessings of the Anointed One!</verse>
				<verse number="30">That’s why I plead with you, because of our union with our Lord Jesus Christ, to be partners with me in your prayers to God. My dear brothers and sisters in the faith, with the love we share in the Holy Spirit, fight alongside me in prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Ask the Father to deliver me from the danger I face from the unbelievers in Judea. For I want to make sure that the contribution I carry for Jerusalem will be favorably received by God’s holy ones.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then he will send me to you with great joy in the pleasure of God’s will, and I will be spiritually refreshed by your fellowship.</verse>
				<verse number="33">And now may the God who gives us his peace and wholeness be with you all. Yes, Lord, so let it be!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">Now, let me introduce to you our dear and beloved sister in the faith, Phoebe, a shining minister of the church in Cenchrea.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I am sending her with this letter and ask that you shower her with your hospitality when she arrives. Embrace her with honor, as is fitting for one who belongs to the Lord and is set apart for him. So provide her whatever she may need, for she’s been a great leader and champion for many—I know, for she’s been that for even me!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Give my love to Prisca and Aquila, my partners in ministry serving the Anointed One, Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="4">for they’ve risked their own lives to save mine. I’m so thankful for them, and not just I, but all the congregations among the non-Jewish people respect them for their ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Also give my loving greetings to all the believers in their house church. And greet Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the Roman province of Asia, for I love him dearly.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And give my greetings to Miriam, who has toiled and labored extremely hard to benefit you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Make sure that my relatives Andronicus and Junia are honored, for they’re my fellow captives who bear the distinctive mark of being outstanding and well-known apostles, and who were joined into the Anointed One before me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Give my regards to Ampliatus, whom I love, for he is joined into the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And give my loving greetings to Urbanus, our partner in ministry serving the Anointed One, and also to Stachus, whom I love.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Don’t forget to greet Apelles for me, for he’s been tested and found to be approved by the Anointed One. And extend warm greetings to all those of Aristobolos’s house church.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Give my love to my relative Herodion, and also to all those of the house church of Narcissus, for they too are joined into the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Please greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, for they are women who have diligently served the Lord. To Persis, who is much loved and faithful in her ministry for the Lord, I send my greetings.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And Rufus, for he is especially chosen by the Lord. And I greet his mother, who was like a mother to me.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I cannot forget to mention my esteemed friends Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and all the brothers and sisters who meet with them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Give my regards to Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and also Olympas and all the holy believers who meet with them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Greet each other with a holy kiss of God’s love. All the believers in all the congregations of the Messiah send their greetings to all of you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And now, dear brothers and sisters, I’d like to give one final word of caution: Watch out for those who cause divisions and offenses among you. When they antagonize you by speaking of things that are contrary to the teachings that you’ve received, don’t be caught in their snare!</verse>
				<verse number="18">For people like this are not truly serving the Lord, our Messiah, but are being driven by their own desires for a following. Utilizing their smooth words and well-rehearsed blessings, they seek to deceive the hearts of innocent ones.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I’m so happy when I think of you, because everyone knows the testimony of your deep commitment of faith. So I want you to become scholars of all that is good and beautiful, and stay pure and innocent when it comes to evil.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And the God of peace will swiftly pound Satan to a pulp under your feet! And the wonderful favor of our Lord Jesus will surround you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">My ministry partner, Timothy, sends his loving greetings, along with Luke, Jason, and Sosipater, my Jewish kinsmen.</verse>
				<verse number="22">(I, Tertius, am the one transcribing this letter for Paul, and I too send my greetings to all of you, as a follower of the Lord.)</verse>
				<verse number="23">My kind host here in Corinth, Gaius, likewise greets you, along with the entire congregation of his house church. Also, the city administrator Erastus and our brother Quartus send their warm greetings.</verse>
				<verse number="24">May the grace and favor of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, continually rest upon you all.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I give all my praises and glory to the one who has more than enough power to make you strong and keep you steadfast through the promises found in my gospel; that is, the proclamation of Jesus, the Anointed One. This wonderful news includes the unveiling of the mystery kept secret from the dawn of creation until now.</verse>
				<verse number="26">This mystery is understood through the prophecies of the Scripture and by the decree of the eternal God. And it is now heard openly by all the nations, igniting within them a deep commitment of faith.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Now to God, the only source of wisdom, be glorious praises for endless ages through Jesus, the Anointed One! Amen! (Paul’s letter was transcribed by Tertius in Corinth and sent from Corinth and carried to Rome by Phoebe.)</verse>
			</chapter>
		</book>
		<book number="46">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, divinely appointed according to the plan of God, to be an apostle of the Anointed One, Jesus. Our fellow believer Sosthenes joins me</verse>
				<verse number="2">in writing you this letter addressed to the community of God throughout the city of Corinth. For you have been made pure, set apart in the Anointed One, Jesus. And God has invited you to be his devoted and holy people, and not only you, but everyone everywhere who calls on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord, and ours also.</verse>
				<verse number="3">May joyous grace and endless peace be yours continually from our Father God and from our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One!</verse>
				<verse number="4">I am always thanking my God for you because he has given you such free and open access to his grace through your union with Jesus, the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="5">In him you have been made extravagantly rich in every way. You have been endowed with a wealth of inspired utterance and the riches that come from your intimate knowledge of him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For the reality of the truth of Christ is seen among you and strengthened through your experience of him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So now you aren’t lacking any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the unveiling of the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He will keep you steady and strong to the very end, making your character mature so that you will be found innocent on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="9">God is forever faithful and can be trusted to do this in you, for he has invited you to co-share the life of his Son, Jesus, the Anointed One, our King!</verse>
				<verse number="10">I urge you, my brothers and sisters, for the sake of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree to live in unity with one another and put to rest any division that attempts to tear you apart. Be restored as one united body living in perfect harmony. Form a consistent choreography among yourselves, having a common perspective with shared values.</verse>
				<verse number="11">My dear brothers and sisters, I have a serious concern I need to bring up with you, for I have been informed by those of Chloe’s house church that you have been destructively arguing among yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And I need to bring this up because each of you is claiming loyalty to different preachers. Some are saying, “I am a disciple of Paul,” or, “I follow Apollos,” or, “I am a disciple of Peter the Rock,” and some, “I belong only to Christ.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">But let me ask you, is Christ divided up into groups? Did I die on the cross for you? At your baptism did you pledge yourselves to follow Paul?</verse>
				<verse number="14">Thank God I only baptized two from Corinth—Crispus and Gaius!</verse>
				<verse number="15">So now no one can say that in my name I baptized others.</verse>
				<verse number="16">(Yes, I also baptized Stephanus and his family. Other than that, I don’t remember baptizing anyone else.)</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the Anointed One has sent me on a mission, not to see how many I could baptize, but to proclaim the good news. And I declare this message stripped of all philosophical arguments that empty the cross of its true power. For I trust in the all-sufficient cross of Christ alone.</verse>
				<verse number="18">To preach the message of the cross seems like sheer nonsense to those who are on their way to destruction, but to us who are being saved, it is the mighty power of God released within us.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For it is written: I will dismantle the wisdom of the wise and I will invalidate the intelligence of the scholars.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So where is the wise philosopher who understands? Where is the expert scholar who comprehends? And where is the skilled debater of our time who could win a debate with God? Hasn’t God demonstrated that the wisdom of this world system is utter foolishness?</verse>
				<verse number="21">For in his wisdom, God designed that all the world’s wisdom would be insufficient to lead people to the discovery of himself. He took great delight in baffling the wisdom of the world by using the simplicity of preaching the story of the cross in order to save those who believe it.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For the Jews constantly demand to see miraculous signs, while those who are not Jews constantly cling to the world’s wisdom,</verse>
				<verse number="23">but we preach the crucified Messiah. The Jews stumble over him and the rest of the world sees him as foolishness.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But for those who have been chosen to follow him, both Jews and Greeks, he is God’s mighty power, God’s true wisdom, and our Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For the “foolish” things of God have proven to be wiser than human wisdom. And the “feeble” things of God have proven to be far more powerful than any human ability.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Brothers and sisters, consider who you were when God called you to salvation. Not many of you were wise scholars by human standards, nor were many of you in positions of power. Not many of you were considered the elite when you answered God’s call.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But God chose those whom the world considers foolish to shame those who think they are wise, and God chose the puny and powerless to shame the high and mighty.</verse>
				<verse number="28">He chose the lowly, the laughable in the world’s eyes—nobodies—so that he would shame the somebodies. For he chose what is regarded as insignificant in order to supersede what is regarded as prominent,</verse>
				<verse number="29">so that there would be no place for prideful boasting in God’s presence.</verse>
				<verse number="30">For it is not from man that we draw our life but from God as we are being joined to Jesus, the Anointed One. And now he is our God-given wisdom, our virtue, our holiness, and our redemption.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And this fulfills what is written: If anyone boasts, let him only boast in all that the Lord has done!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">My brothers and sisters, when I first came to proclaim to you the secrets of God, I refused to come as an expert, trying to impress you with my eloquent speech and lofty wisdom.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For while I was with you I was determined to be consumed with one topic—Jesus, the crucified Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I stood before you feeling inadequate, filled with reverence for God, and trembling under the sense of the importance of my words.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The message I preached and how I preached it was not an attempt to sway you with persuasive arguments but to prove to you the almighty power of God’s Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For God intended that your faith not be established on man’s wisdom but by trusting in his almighty power.</verse>
				<verse number="6">However, there is a wisdom that we continually speak of when we are among the spiritually mature. It’s wisdom that didn’t originate in this present age, nor did it come from the rulers of this age who are in the process of being dethroned.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Instead, we continually speak of this wonderful wisdom that comes from God, hidden before now in a mystery. It is his secret plan, destined before the ages, to bring us into glory.</verse>
				<verse number="8">None of the rulers of this present world order understood it, for if they had, they never would have crucified the Lord of shining glory.</verse>
				<verse number="9">This is why the Scriptures say: Things never discovered or heard of before, things beyond our ability to imagine — these are the many things God has in store for all his lovers.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But God now unveils these profound realities to us by the Spirit. Yes, he has revealed to us his inmost heart and deepest mysteries through the Holy Spirit, who constantly explores all things.</verse>
				<verse number="11">After all, who can really see into a person’s heart and know his hidden impulses except for that person’s spirit? So it is with God. His thoughts and secrets are only fully understood by his Spirit, the Spirit of God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For we did not receive the spirit of this world system but the Spirit of God, so that we might come to understand and experience all that grace has lavished upon us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And we articulate these realities with the words imparted to us by the Spirit and not with the words taught by human wisdom. We join together Spirit-revealed truths with Spirit-revealed words.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Someone living on an entirely human level rejects the revelations of God’s Spirit, for they make no sense to him. He can’t understand the revelations of the Spirit because they are only discovered by the illumination of the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Those who live in the Spirit are able to carefully evaluate all things, and they are subject to the scrutiny of no one but God.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For Who has ever intimately known the mind of the Lord Yahweh well enough to become his counselor? Christ has, and we possess Christ’s perceptions.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Brothers and sisters, when I was with you I found it impossible to speak to you as those who are spiritually mature people, for you are still dominated by the mind-set of the flesh. And because you are immature infants in Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="2">I had to nurse you and feed you with “milk,” not with the solid food of more advanced teachings, because you weren’t ready for it. In fact, you are still not ready to be fed solid food,</verse>
				<verse number="3">for you are living your lives dominated by the mind-set of the flesh. Ask yourselves: Is there jealousy among you? Do you compare yourselves with others? Do you quarrel like children and end up taking sides? If so, this proves that you are living your lives centered on yourselves, dominated by the mind-set of the flesh, and behaving like unbelievers.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For when you divide yourselves up in groups—a “Paul group” and an “Apollos group” —you’re acting like people without the Spirit’s influence.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Who is Apollos, really? Or who is Paul? Aren’t we both just servants through whom you believed our message? Aren’t each of us doing the ministry the Lord has assigned to us?</verse>
				<verse number="6">I planted the church, and Apollos came and cared for it, but it was God who caused it to grow.</verse>
				<verse number="7">This means the one who plants is not anybody special, nor the one who waters, for God is the one who brings the supernatural growth.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now, the one who plants and the one who waters are equally important and on the same team, but each will be rewarded for his own work.</verse>
				<verse number="9">We are coworkers with God and you are God’s cultivated garden, the house he is building.</verse>
				<verse number="10">God has given me unique gifts as a skilled master builder who lays a good foundation. Afterward another craftsman comes and builds on it. So builders beware! Let every builder do his work carefully, according to God’s standards.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For no one is empowered to lay an alternative foundation other than the good foundation that exists, which is Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="12">The quality of materials used by anyone building on this foundation will soon be made apparent, whether it has been built with gold, silver, and costly stones, or wood, hay, and straw. Their work will soon become evident, for the Day will make it clear, because it will be revealed by blazing fire! And the fire will test and prove the workmanship of each builder.</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">If his work stands the test of fire, he will be rewarded.</verse>
				<verse number="15">If his work is consumed by the fire, he will suffer great loss. Yet he himself will barely escape destruction, like one being rescued out of a burning house.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Don’t you realize that together you have become God’s inner sanctuary and that the Spirit of God makes his permanent home in you?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now, if someone desecrates God’s inner sanctuary, God will desecrate him, for God’s inner sanctuary is holy, and that is exactly who you are.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So why fool yourself and live under an illusion? Make no mistake about it, if anyone thinks he is wise by the world’s standards, he will be made wiser by being a fool for God!</verse>
				<verse number="19">For what the world says is wisdom is actually foolishness in God’s eyes. As it is written: The cleverness of the know-it-alls becomes the trap that ensnares them.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And again: The Lord sees right through the clever reasonings of the wise and knows that it’s all a sham.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So don’t be proud of your allegiance to any human leader. For actually, you already have everything! It has all been given for your benefit,</verse>
				<verse number="22">whether it is Paul or Apollos or Peter the Rock, or whether it’s the world or life or death, or whether it’s the present or the future—everything belongs to you!</verse>
				<verse number="23">And now you are joined to the Messiah, who is joined to God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">So then you must perceive us— not as leaders of factions, but as servants of the Anointed One, those who have been entrusted with God’s mysteries.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The most important quality of one entrusted with such secrets is that they are faithful and trustworthy.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But personally, I’m not the least bit concerned if I’m judged by you or any verdict I receive from any human court. In fact, I don’t even assume to be my own judge,</verse>
				<verse number="4">even though my conscience is clear. But that doesn’t mean I stand acquitted before the Lord, for the only judge I care about is him!</verse>
				<verse number="5">So resist the temptation to pronounce premature judgment on anything before the appointed time when all will be fully revealed. Instead, wait until the Lord makes his appearance, for he will bring all that is hidden in darkness to light and unveil every secret motive of everyone’s heart. Then, when the whole truth is known, each will receive praise from God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Dear brothers and sisters, I’ve been referring allusively to myself and Apollos in order to illustrate what I’ve been saying. It is futile to move beyond what is written in the Scriptures and be inflated with self-importance by following and promoting one leader in competition with another.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For what makes a distinction between you and someone else? And what do you have that grace has not given you? And if you received it as a gift, why do you boast as though there is something special about you?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Oh, I know, you already have all you need! Since when did you become so content and rich without us? You’ve already crowned yourselves as royalty, reigning on your thrones, leaving us lowly apostles far behind! How I wish indeed that you really were reigning as kings already, for that would mean we would be reigning as kings alongside of you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">It seems to me that God has appointed us apostles to be at the end of the line. We are like those on display at the end of the procession, as doomed gladiators soon to be killed. We have become a theatrical spectacle to all creation, both to people and to angels.</verse>
				<verse number="10">We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are the frail; you are the powerful. You are celebrated; we are humiliated.</verse>
				<verse number="11">If you could see us now, you’d find that we are hungry and thirsty, poorly clothed, brutally treated, and with no roof over our heads.</verse>
				<verse number="12">We work hard, toiling with our own hands. When people abuse and insult us, we respond with a blessing, and when severely persecuted, we endure it with patience.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When we are slandered incessantly, we always answer gently, ready to reconcile. Even now, in the world’s opinion, we are nothing but filth and the lowest scum.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I’m not writing this to embarrass you or to shame you, but to correct you as the children I love.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For although you could have countless babysitters in Christ telling you what you’re doing wrong, you don’t have many fathers who correct you in love. But I’m a true father to you, for I became your father when I gave you the gospel and brought you into union with Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So I encourage you, my children, to follow the example that I live before you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">That’s why I’ve sent my dear son Timothy, whom I love. He is faithful to the Lord Yahweh and will remind you of how I conduct myself as one who lives in union with Jesus, the Anointed One, and of the teachings that I bring to every church everywhere.</verse>
				<verse number="18">There are some among you who have exalted themselves as if I were not coming back to you.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But I will come soon, if it pleases the Lord, and I will find out not only what these arrogant ones are saying, but also if they have power to back up their words!</verse>
				<verse number="20">For the kingdom realm of God comes with power, not simply impressive words.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So which would you prefer? Shall I come carrying the rod of authority to discipline or with an embrace in love with a gentle spirit?</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">It’s been widely reported that there is gross sexual immorality among you—the kind of immorality that’s so revolting it’s not even tolerated by the social norms of unbelievers. Are you proud of the fact that one of your men is having sex with his stepmother? Shouldn’t this heartbreaking scandal bring you to your knees in tears? You must remove the offender from among you!</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">Even though I am physically far away from you, my spirit is present with you. And as one who is present with you, I have already evaluated and judged the perpetrator.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So call a meeting, and when you gather together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and you know my spirit is present with you in the infinite power of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="5">release this man over to Satan for the destruction of his rebellious flesh, in hope that his spirit may be rescued and restored in the day of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Boasting over your tolerance of sin is inappropriate. Don’t you understand that even a small compromise with sin permeates the entire fellowship, just as a little leaven permeates a batch of dough?</verse>
				<verse number="7">So remove every trace of your “leaven” of compromise with sin so that you might become new and pure again. For indeed, you are clean because Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So now we can celebrate our continual feast, not with the old “leaven,” the yeast of wickedness or bitterness, but we will feast on the freshly baked bread of innocence and holiness.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I wrote you in my previous letter asking you not to associate with those who practice sexual immorality.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yet in no way was I referring to avoiding contact with unbelievers who are immoral, or greedy, or swindlers, or those who worship other gods—for that would mean you’d have to isolate yourself from the world entirely!</verse>
				<verse number="11">But now I’m writing to you so that you would exclude from your fellowship anyone who calls himself a fellow believer and practices sexual immorality, or is consumed with greed, or is an idolater, or is verbally abusive or a drunkard or a swindler. Don’t mingle with them or even have a meal with someone like that.</verse>
				<verse number="12">What right do I have to pronounce judgment on unbelievers? That’s God’s responsibility. But those who are inside the church family are our responsibility to discern and judge. So it’s your duty to remove that wicked one from among you.</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Furthermore, how dare you take a fellow believer to court! It is wrong to drag him before the unrighteous to settle a legal dispute. Isn’t it better to take him before God’s holy believers to settle the matter?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Don’t you realize that we, the holy ones, will judge the universe? If the unbelieving world is under your jurisdiction, you should be fully competent to settle these trivial lawsuits among yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For surely you know that we will one day judge angels, let alone these everyday matters.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Don’t you realize that you are bringing your issues before civil judges appointed by people who have no standing within the church?</verse>
				<verse number="5">What a shame that there is not one within the church who has the spirit of wisdom who could arbitrate these disputes and reconcile the offended parties!</verse>
				<verse number="6">It’s not right for a believer to sue a fellow believer—and especially to bring it before the unbelievers.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Don’t you realize that when you drag another believer into court you’re providing the evidence that you are already defeated? Wouldn’t it be better to accept the fact that someone is trying to cheat and take advantage of you, and simply choose the high road? At times it is better to just accept injustice and even to let someone take advantage of you, rather than to expose our conflicts publicly before unbelievers.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But instead you keep cheating and doing wrong to your brothers and sisters, and then request that unbelievers render their judgment!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Surely you must know that people who practice evil cannot possess God’s kingdom realm. Stop being deceived! People who continue to engage in sexual immorality, idolatry, adultery, sexual perversion, homosexuality,</verse>
				<verse number="10">fraud, greed, drunkenness, verbal abuse, or extortion—these will not inherit God’s kingdom realm.</verse>
				<verse number="11">It’s true that some of you once lived in those lifestyles, but now you have been purified from sin, made holy, and given a perfect standing before God—all because of the power of the name of the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, and through our union with the Spirit of our God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">It’s true that our freedom allows us to do anything, but that doesn’t mean that everything we do is good for us. I’m free to do as I choose, but I choose to never be enslaved to anything.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Some have said, “I eat to live and I live to eat!” But God will do away with it all. The body was not created for illicit sex, but to serve and worship our Lord Jesus, who can fill the body with himself.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now the God who raised up our Lord from the grave will awaken and raise us up through his mighty power!</verse>
				<verse number="15">Don’t you know that your bodies belong to Christ as his body parts? Should one presume to take the members of Christ’s body and make them into members of a harlot? Absolutely not!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Aren’t you aware of the fact that when anyone sleeps with a prostitute he becomes a part of her, and she becomes a part of him? For it has been declared: The two become a single body.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But the one who joins himself to the Lord is mingled into one spirit with him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">This is why you must keep running away from sexual immorality. For every other sin a person commits is external to the body, but immorality involves sinning against your own body.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Have you forgotten that your body is now the sacred temple of the Spirit of Holiness, who lives in you? You don’t belong to yourself any longer, for the gift of God, the Holy Spirit, lives inside your sanctuary.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You were God’s expensive purchase, paid for with tears of blood, so by all means, then, use your body to bring glory to God!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Now for my response concerning the issues you’ve asked me to address. You wrote saying, “It is proper for a man to live in celibacy.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Perhaps. But because of the danger of immorality, each husband should have sexual intimacy with his wife and each wife should have sexual intimacy with her husband.</verse>
				<verse number="3">A husband has the responsibility of meeting the sexual needs of his wife, and likewise a wife to her husband.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Neither the husband nor the wife have exclusive rights to their own bodies, but those rights are to be surrendered to the other.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So don’t continue to refuse your spouse those rights, except perhaps by mutual agreement for a specified time so that you can both be devoted to prayer. And then you should resume your physical pleasure so that the Adversary cannot take advantage of you because of the desires of your body.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I’m not giving you a divine command, but my godly advice.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I would wish that all of you could live unmarried, just as I do. Yet I understand that we are all decidedly different, with each having a special grace for one thing or another.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So let me say to the unmarried and those who have lost their spouses, it is fine for you to remain single as I am.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But if you have no power over your passions, then you should go ahead and marry, for marriage is far better than a continual battle with lust.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And to those who are married, I give this charge—which is not mine, but the Lord’s —that the wife should not depart from her husband.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But if she does, then she should either remain unmarried or reconcile with her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.</verse>
				<verse number="12">To the rest I say, which is not a saying of the Lord, if a brother has an unbelieving wife and she is content to live with him, he should not divorce her.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is content to live with her, she should not divorce him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For the unbelieving husband has been made holy by his believing wife. And the unbelieving wife has been made holy by her believing husband by virtue of his or her sacred union to a believer. Otherwise, the children from this union would be unclean, but in fact, they are holy.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But if the unbelieving spouse wants a divorce, then let it be so. In this situation the believing spouse is not bound to the marriage, for God has called us to live in peace.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And wives, for all you know you could one day lead your husband to salvation. Or husbands, how do you know for sure that you could not one day lead your wife to salvation?</verse>
				<verse number="17">May all believers continue to live the wonderful lives God has called them to live, according to what he assigns for each person, for this is what I teach to believers everywhere.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If when you were called to follow Jesus you were circumcised, it would be futile to try to undo the circumcision. And if you were called while yet uncircumcised, there is no need to be circumcised.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Your identity before God has nothing to do with circumcision or uncircumcision. What really matters is following God’s commandments.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So everyone should continue to live faithful in the situation of life in which they were called to follow Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Were you a slave when you heard the call to follow Jesus? Don’t let that concern you. Even if you can gain your freedom, make the most of the opportunity.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For truly, if you are called to a life-union with the Lord, you are already a free man! And those who were called to follow Jesus when they were free are now the Messiah’s slaves.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Since a great price was paid for your redemption, stop having the mind-set of a slave.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Brothers and sisters, we must remain in close communion with God, no matter what our situation was when we were first called to follow Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now let me address the issue of singleness. I must confess, I have no command to give you that comes directly from the Lord. But let me share my thoughts on the matter, as coming from one who has experienced the mercy of the Lord to keep me faithful to him.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Because of the severe pressure we are in, I recommend you remain as you are.</verse>
				<verse number="27">If you are married, stay in the marriage. If you are single, don’t rush into marriage.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But if you do get married, you haven’t sinned. It’s just that I would want to spare you the problems you’ll face with the extra challenges of being married.</verse>
				<verse number="29">My friends, what I mean is this. The urgency of our times mean that from now on, those who have wives should live as though without them.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And those who weep should forget their tears. And those who rejoice will have no time to celebrate. And those who purchase items will have no time to enjoy them.</verse>
				<verse number="31">We are to live as those who live in the world but are not absorbed by it, for the world as we know it is quickly passing away.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Because of this, we need to live as free from anxiety as possible. For a single man is focused on the things of the Lord and how he may please him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But a married man is pulled in two directions, for he is concerned about both the things of God and the things of the world in order to please his wife.</verse>
				<verse number="34">And the single woman is focused on the things of the Lord so she can be holy both in body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the things of the world and how she may please her husband.</verse>
				<verse number="35">I am trying to help you and make things easier for you and not make things difficult, but so that you would have undistracted devotion, serving the Lord constantly with an undivided heart.</verse>
				<verse number="36">However, if a man has decided to serve God as a single person, yet changes his mind and finds himself in love with a woman, although he never intended to marry, let him go ahead and marry her; it is not a sin to do so.</verse>
				<verse number="37">On the other hand, if a man stands firm in his heart to remain single, and is under no compulsion to get married but has control over his passions and is determined to remain celibate, he has chosen well.</verse>
				<verse number="38">So then, the one who marries his fiancée does well and the one who chooses not to marry her does better.</verse>
				<verse number="39">A wife is bound by the marriage covenant as long as her husband is living. But if the husband dies, she is free to marry again as she desires—but, of course, he should be a believer in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="40">However, in my opinion (and I think that I too have the Spirit of God), she would be happier if she remained single.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Now let me address the issue of food offered in sacrifice to idols. It seems that everyone believes his own opinion is right on this matter. How easily we get puffed up over our opinions! But love builds up the structure of our new life.</verse>
				<verse number="2">If anyone thinks of himself as a know-it-all, he still has a lot to learn.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But if a person passionately loves God, he will possess the knowledge of God.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Concerning food sacrificed as offerings to idols, we all know that an idol is nothing, for there is no God but one.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Although there may be many so-called gods in this world, and in heaven there may be many “gods,” “lords,” and “masters,”</verse>
				<verse number="6">yet for us there is only one God—the Father. Out of him is all things, and our lives are lived for him. And there is one Lord, Jesus, the Anointed One, through whom we and all things exist.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But not everyone has this revelation. For some were formerly idolaters, who consider idols as real and living. That’s why they consider the food offered to that “god” as defiled. And their weak consciences become defiled if they eat it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yes, we know that what you eat will not bring you closer to God. You are no better if you don’t eat certain foods and no better if you do.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But you must be careful that the liberty you exercise in eating food offered to idols doesn’t offend the weak believers.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For if a believer with a weak conscience sees you, who have a greater understanding, dining in an idol’s temple, won’t this be a temptation to him to violate his own conscience and eat food offered to idols?</verse>
				<verse number="11">So, in effect, by exercising your understanding of freedom, you have ruined this weak believer, a brother for whom Christ has died!</verse>
				<verse number="12">And when you offend weaker believers by wounding their consciences in this way, you also offend the Anointed One!</verse>
				<verse number="13">So I conclude that if my eating certain food deeply offends my brother and hinders his advance in Christ, I will never eat it again. I don’t want to be guilty of causing my brother or sister to be wounded and defeated.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Am I not completely free and unrestrained? Absolutely! Am I not an apostle? Of course! Haven’t I had a personal encounter with our Jesus face-to-face— and continue to see him? Emphatically yes! Aren’t you all the proof of my ministry in the Lord? Certainly!</verse>
				<verse number="2">If others do not recognize me as their apostle, at least you are bound to do so, for now your lives are joined to the Lord. You are the living proof, the certificate of my apostleship.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So to those who want to continually criticize my apostolic ministry, here’s my statement of defense.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Don’t we apostles have the right to be supported financially?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Don’t we have the right to travel accompanied by our believing wives and be supported as a couple, as do the other apostles, such as Peter the Rock and the Lord’s brothers?</verse>
				<verse number="6">Of course we do! Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to stop working for a living?</verse>
				<verse number="7">Who serves in the military at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not enjoy the grapes for himself? Who would nurture and shepherd a flock and never get to drink its fresh milk?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Am I merely giving you my own opinions, or does the Torah teach the same things?</verse>
				<verse number="9">For it is written in the law of Moses: You should never put a muzzle over the mouth of an ox while he is treading out the grain. Tell me, is God only talking about oxen here?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Doesn’t he also give us this principle so that we won’t withhold support from his workers? It was written so that we would understand that the one spiritually “plowing” and spiritually “treading out the grain” also labors with the expectation of enjoying the harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So, if we’ve sowed many spiritual gifts among you, is it too much to expect to reap material gifts from you?</verse>
				<verse number="12">And if you have supported others, don’t we rightfully deserve this privilege even more? But as you know, we haven’t used that right. Instead, we have continued to support ourselves so that we would never be a hindrance to the spread of the gospel of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Don’t you know that the priests employed in sacred duty in the temple are provided for by temple resources? And the priests who serve at the altar receive a portion of the offerings?</verse>
				<verse number="14">In the same way, the Lord has directed those who proclaim the gospel to receive their living by the gospel. As for me, I’ve preferred to never use any of these rights for myself.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And keep in mind that I’m not writing all this because I’m hinting that you should support me. Actually, I’d rather die than to have anyone rob me of this joyous reason for boasting!</verse>
				<verse number="16">For you see, even though I proclaim the good news, I can’t take the credit for my labors, for I am compelled to fulfill my duty by completing this work. It would be agony to me if I did not constantly preach the gospel!</verse>
				<verse number="17">If it were my own idea to preach as a way to make a living, I would expect to be paid. Since it’s not my idea but God’s, who commissioned me, I am entrusted with the stewardship of the gospel whether or not I’m paid.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So then, where is my reward? It is found in continually depositing the good news into people’s hearts, without obligation, free of charge, and not insisting on my rights to be financially supported.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now, even though I am free from obligations to others, I joyfully make myself a servant to all in order to win as many converts as possible.</verse>
				<verse number="20">I became Jewish to the Jewish people in order to win them to the Messiah. I became like one under the law to gain the people who were stuck under the law, even though I myself am not under the law.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And to those who are without the Jewish laws, I became like them, as one without the Jewish laws, in order to win them, although I’m not outside the law of God but under the law of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I became “weak” to the weak to win the weak. I have adapted to the culture of every place I’ve gone so that I could more easily win people to Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I’ve done all this so that I would become God’s partner for the sake of the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Isn’t it obvious that all runners on the racetrack keep on running to win, but only one receives the victor’s prize? Yet each one of you must run the race to be victorious.</verse>
				<verse number="25">A true athlete will be disciplined in every respect, practicing constant self-control in order to win a laurel wreath that quickly withers. But we run our race to win a victor’s crown that will last forever.</verse>
				<verse number="26">For that reason, I don’t run just for exercise or box like one throwing aimless punches,</verse>
				<verse number="27">but I train like a champion athlete. I subdue my body and get it under my control, so that after preaching the good news to others I myself won’t be disqualified.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">My dear fellow believers, you need to understand that all of our Jewish ancestors who walked through a wilderness long ago were under the glory cloud and passed through the waters of the sea on both sides.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They were all baptized into the cloud of glory, into the fellowship of Moses, and into the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They all ate the same heavenly manna</verse>
				<verse number="4">and drank water from the same spiritual rock that traveled with them—and that Rock was Christ himself.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yet God was not pleased with most of them, and their dead bodies were scattered around the wilderness.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now, all these things serve as types and pictures for us—lessons that teach us not to fail in the same way by callously craving worthless things</verse>
				<verse number="7">and practicing idolatry, as some of them did. For it is written: The people settled in to their unrestrained revelry, with feasting and drinking, then they rose up and became wildly out of control!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Neither should we commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, which caused the death of twenty-three thousand on a single day.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Nor should we ever provoke the Lord, as some of them did by putting him to outrageous tests that resulted in their death from snakebites day after day.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And we must not embrace their ways by complaining—grumbling with discontent, as many of them did, and were killed by the destroyer!</verse>
				<verse number="11">All the tests they endured on their way through the wilderness are a symbolic picture, an example that provides us with a warning so that we can learn through what they experienced. For we live in a time when the purpose of all the ages past is now completing its goal within us.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So beware if you think it could never happen to you, lest your pride becomes your downfall.</verse>
				<verse number="13">We all experience times of testing, which is normal for every human being. But God will be faithful to you. He will screen and filter the severity, nature, and timing of every test or trial you face so that you can bear it. And each test is an opportunity to trust him more, for along with every trial God has provided for you a way of escape that will bring you out of it victoriously.</verse>
				<verse number="14">My cherished friends, keep on running far away from idolatry.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I know I am writing to thoughtful people, so carefully consider what I say.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For when we pray for the blessing of the communion cup, isn’t this our co-participation with the blood of Jesus? And the bread that we distribute, isn’t this the bread of our co-participation with the body of Christ?</verse>
				<verse number="17">For although we’re many, we become one loaf of bread and one body as we feast together on one loaf.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Consider the people of Israel when they fell into idolatry. When they ate the sacrifices offered to the gods, weren’t they becoming communal participants in what was sacrificed?</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now, am I saying that idols and the sacrifices offered to them have any value?</verse>
				<verse number="20">Absolutely not! However, I am implying that when an unbeliever offers a sacrifice to an idol, it is not offered to the true God but to a demon. I don’t want you to be participants with demons!</verse>
				<verse number="21">You can’t drink from the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can’t feast at the table of the Lord and feast at the table of demons.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Who would ever want to arouse the Lord’s jealousy? Is that something you think you’re strong enough to endure?</verse>
				<verse number="23">You say, “ Under grace there are no rules and we’re free to do anything we please.” Not exactly. Because not everything promotes growth in others. Your slogan, “We’re allowed to do anything we choose,” may be true—but not everything causes the spiritual advancement of others.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So don’t always seek what is best for you at the expense of another.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Yes, you are free to eat anything without worrying about your conscience,</verse>
				<verse number="26">for the earth and all its abundance belongs to the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="27">So if an unbeliever invites you to dinner, go ahead and eat whatever is served, without asking questions concerning where it came from.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But if he goes out of his way to inform you that the meat was actually an offering sacrificed to idols, then you should pass, not only for his sake but because of his conscience.</verse>
				<verse number="29">I’m talking about someone else’s conscience, not yours. What good is there in doing what you please if it’s condemned by someone else?</verse>
				<verse number="30">So if I voluntarily participate, why should I be judged for celebrating my freedom?</verse>
				<verse number="31">Whether you eat or drink, live your life in a way that glorifies and honors God.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And make sure you’re not offending Jews or Greeks or any part of God’s assembly over your personal preferences.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Follow my example, for I try to please everyone in all things, rather than putting my liberty first. I sincerely attempt to do anything I can so that others may be saved.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">I want you to pattern your lives after me, just as I pattern mine after Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And I give you full credit for always keeping me in mind as you follow carefully the substance of my instructions that I’ve taught you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every person, and Adam was the head of Eve, and God is the head of the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Any man who leads public worship, and prays or prophesies with a shawl hanging down over his head, shows disrespect to his head, which is Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And if any woman in a place of leadership within the church prays or prophesies in public with her long hair disheveled, she shows disrespect to her head, which is her husband, for this would be the same as having her head shaved.</verse>
				<verse number="6">If a woman who wants to be in leadership will not conform to the customs of what is proper for women, she might as well cut off her hair. But if it’s disgraceful for her to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her cover her head.</verse>
				<verse number="7">A man in leadership is under no obligation to have his head covered in the public gatherings, because he is the portrait of God and reflects his glory. The woman, on the other hand, reflects the glory of her husband,</verse>
				<verse number="8">for man was not created from woman but woman from man.</verse>
				<verse number="9">By the same token, the man was not created because the woman needed him; the woman was created because the man needed her.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For this reason she should have authority over the head because of the angels.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So then, I have to insist that in the Lord, neither is woman inferior to man nor is man inferior to woman.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For just as woman was taken from the side of man, in the same way man is taken from the womb of woman. God, as the source of all things, designed it this way.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So then you can decide for yourselves—is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her hair unbound?</verse>
				<verse number="14">Doesn’t our long-established cultural tradition teach us that if a man has long hair that is ornamentally arranged it invites disgrace, but if a woman has long hair that is ornamentally arranged it is her glory?</verse>
				<verse number="15">This is because long hair is the endowment that God has given her as a head covering.</verse>
				<verse number="16">If someone wants to quarrel about this, I want you to know that we have no intention to start an argument, neither I nor the congregations of God.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now, on this next matter, I wish I could commend you, but I cannot, because when you meet together as a church family it is doing more harm than good!</verse>
				<verse number="18">I’ve been told many times that when you meet as a congregation, divisions and cliques emerge—and to some extent, this doesn’t surprise me.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Differences of opinion are unavoidable, yet they will reveal which ones among you truly have God’s approval.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When all of your house churches gather as one church family, you are not really properly celebrating the Lord’s Supper.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For when it comes time to eat, some gobble down their food before anything is given to others—one is left hungry while others become drunk!</verse>
				<verse number="22">Don’t you all have homes where you can eat and drink? Don’t you realize that you’re showing a superior attitude by humiliating those who have nothing? Are you trying to show contempt for God’s beloved church? How should I address this appropriately? If you’re looking for my approval, you won’t find it!</verse>
				<verse number="23">I have handed down to you what came to me by direct revelation from the Lord himself. The same night in which he was handed over, he took bread</verse>
				<verse number="24">and gave thanks. Then he distributed it to the disciples and said, “Take it and eat your fill. It is my body, which is given for you. Do this to remember me.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">He did the same with the cup of wine after supper and said, “This cup seals the new covenant with my blood. Drink it—and whenever you drink this, do it to remember me.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are retelling the story, proclaiming our Lord’s death until he comes.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For this reason, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit will be guilty of dishonoring the body and blood of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So let each individual first evaluate his own attitude and only then eat the bread and drink the cup.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For continually eating and drinking with a wrong spirit will bring judgment upon yourself by not recognizing the body.</verse>
				<verse number="30">This insensitivity is why many of you are weak, chronically ill, and some even dying.</verse>
				<verse number="31">If we have examined ourselves, we should not be judged.</verse>
				<verse number="32">But when we are judged, it is the Lord’s training so that we will not be condemned along with the world.</verse>
				<verse number="33">So then, my fellow believers, when you assemble as one to share a meal, show respect for one another and wait for all to be served.</verse>
				<verse number="34">If you are that hungry, eat at home first, so that when you gather together you will not bring judgment upon yourself. When I come to you, I will answer the other questions you asked me in your letter.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">My fellow believers, I don’t want you to be confused about spiritual realities.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For you know full well that when you were unbelievers you were often led astray in one way or another by your worship of idols, which are incapable of talking with you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Therefore, I want to impart to you an understanding of the following: No one speaking by the Spirit of God would ever say, “Jesus is the accursed one.” No one can say, “Jesus is the Lord Yahweh,” unless the Holy Spirit is speaking through him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">It is the same Holy Spirit who continues to distribute many different varieties of gifts.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The Lord Yahweh is one, and he is the one who apportions to believers different varieties of ministries.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The same God distributes different kinds of miracles that accomplish different results through each believer’s gift and ministry as he energizes and activates them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Each believer is given continuous revelation by the Holy Spirit to benefit not just himself but all.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For example: The Spirit gives to one the gift of the word of wisdom. To another, the same Spirit gives the gift of the word of revelation knowledge.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And to another, the same Spirit gives the gift of faith. And to another, the same Spirit gives gifts of healing.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And to another the power to work miracles. And to another the gift of prophecy. And to another the gift to discern what the Spirit is speaking. And to another the gift of speaking different kinds of tongues. And to another the gift of interpretation of tongues.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Remember, it is the same Holy Spirit who distributes, activates, and operates these different gifts as he chooses for each believer.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Just as the human body is one, though it has many parts that together form one body, so too is Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For by one Spirit we all were immersed and mingled into one single body. And no matter our status—whether we are Jews or non-Jews, oppressed or free—we are all privileged to drink deeply of the same Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="14">In fact, the human body is not one single part but rather many parts mingled into one.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So if the foot were to say, “Since I’m not a hand, I’m not a part of the body,” it’s forgetting that it is still a vital part of the body.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And if the ear were to say, “Since I’m not an eye, I’m not really a part of the body,” it’s forgetting that it is still an important part of the body.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Think of it this way. If the whole body were just an eyeball, how could it hear sounds? And if the whole body were just an ear, how could it smell different fragrances?</verse>
				<verse number="18">But God has carefully designed each member and placed it in the body to function as he desires.</verse>
				<verse number="19">A diversity is required, for if the body consisted of one single part, there wouldn’t be a body at all!</verse>
				<verse number="20">So now we see that there are many differing parts and functions, but one body.</verse>
				<verse number="21">It would be wrong for the eye to say to the hand, “I don’t need you,” and equally wrong if the head said to the foot, “I don’t need you.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">In fact, the weaker our parts, the more vital and essential they are.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The body parts we think are less honorable we treat with greater respect. And the body parts that need to be covered in public we treat with propriety and clothe them.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But some of our body parts don’t require as much attention. Instead, God has mingled the body parts together, giving greater honor to the “lesser” members who lacked it.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He has done this intentionally so that every member would look after the others with mutual concern, and so that there will be no division in the body.</verse>
				<verse number="26">In that way, whatever happens to one member happens to all. If one suffers, everyone suffers. If one is honored, everyone rejoices.</verse>
				<verse number="27">You are the body of the Anointed One, and each of you is a unique and vital part of it.</verse>
				<verse number="28">God has placed in the church the following: First apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then those with gifts of miracles, gifts of divine healing, gifts of revelation knowledge, gifts of leadership, and gifts of different kinds of tongues.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Not everyone is an apostle or a prophet or a teacher. Not everyone performs miracles</verse>
				<verse number="30">or has gifts of healing or speaks in tongues or interprets tongues.</verse>
				<verse number="31">But you should all constantly boil over with passion in seeking the higher gifts. And now I will show you a superior way to live that is beyond comparison!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">If I were to speak with eloquence in earth’s many languages, and in the heavenly tongues of angels, yet I didn’t express myself with love, my words would be reduced to the hollow sound of nothing more than a clanging cymbal.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And if I were to have the gift of prophecy with a profound understanding of God’s hidden secrets, and if I possessed unending supernatural knowledge, and if I had the greatest gift of faith that could move mountains, but have never learned to love, then I am nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And if I were to be so generous as to give away everything I owned to feed the poor, and to offer my body to be burned as a martyr, without the pure motive of love, I would gain nothing of value.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Love is large and incredibly patient. Love is gentle and consistently kind to all. It refuses to be jealous when blessing comes to someone else. Love does not brag about one’s achievements nor inflate its own importance.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Love does not traffic in shame and disrespect, nor selfishly seek its own honor. Love is not easily irritated or quick to take offense.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Love joyfully celebrates honesty and finds no delight in what is wrong.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Love is a safe place of shelter, for it never stops believing the best for others. Love never takes failure as defeat, for it never gives up.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Love never stops loving. It extends beyond the gift of prophecy, which eventually fades away. It is more enduring than tongues, which will one day fall silent. Love remains long after words of knowledge are forgotten.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Our present knowledge and our prophecies are but partial,</verse>
				<verse number="10">but when love’s perfection arrives, the partial will fade away.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When I was a child, I spoke about childish matters, for I saw things like a child and reasoned like a child. But the day came when I matured, and I set aside my childish ways.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For now we see but a faint reflection of riddles and mysteries as though reflected in a mirror, but one day we will see face-to-face. My understanding is incomplete now, but one day I will understand everything, just as everything about me has been fully understood.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Until then, there are three things that remain: faith, hope, and love—yet love surpasses them all. So above all else, let love be the beautiful prize for which you run.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">It is good that you are enthusiastic and passionate about spiritual gifts, especially prophecy.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When someone speaks in tongues, no one understands a word he says, because he’s not speaking to people, but to God—he is speaking intimate mysteries in the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But when someone prophesies, he speaks to encourage people, to build them up, and to bring them comfort.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The one who speaks in tongues advances his own spiritual progress, while the one who prophesies builds up the church.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I would be delighted if you all spoke in tongues, but I desire even more that you impart prophetic revelation to others. Greater gain comes through the one who prophesies than the one who speaks in tongues, unless there is interpretation so that it builds up the entire church.</verse>
				<verse number="6">My dear friends, what good is it if I come to you always speaking in tongues? But if I come with a clear revelation from God, or with insight, or with a prophecy, or with a clear teaching, I can enrich you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Similarly, if musical instruments, such as flutes or stringed instruments, are out of tune and don’t play the arrangement clearly, how will anyone recognize the melody?</verse>
				<verse number="8">If the bugle makes a garbled sound, who will recognize the signal to show up for the battle?</verse>
				<verse number="9">So it is with you. Unless you speak in a language that’s easily understood, how will anyone know what you’re talking about? You might as well save your breath!</verse>
				<verse number="10">I suppose that the world has all sorts of languages, and each conveys meaning to the ones who speak it.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But I am like a foreigner if I don’t understand the language, and the speaker will be like a foreigner to me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And that’s what’s happening among you. You are so passionate about embracing the manifestations of the Holy Spirit! Now become even more passionate about the things that strengthen the entire church.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So then, if you speak in a tongue, pray for the interpretation to be able to unfold the meaning of what you are saying.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For if I am praying in a tongue, my spirit is engaged in prayer but I have no clear understanding of what is being said.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So here’s what I’ve concluded. I will pray in the Spirit, but I will also pray with my mind engaged. I will sing rapturous praises in the Spirit, but I will also sing with my mind engaged.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Otherwise, if you are praising God in your spirit, how could someone without the gift participate by adding his “amen” to your giving of thanks, since he doesn’t have a clue of what you’re saying?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Your praise to God is admirable, but it does nothing to strengthen and build up others.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I give thanks to God that I speak in tongues more than all of you,</verse>
				<verse number="19">but in the church setting I would rather speak five words that can be understood than ten thousand exotic words in a tongue. That way I could have a role in teaching others.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Beloved ones, don’t remain as immature children in your reasoning. As it relates to evil, be like newborns, but in your thinking be mature adults.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For it stands written in the law: I will bring my message to this people with strange tongues and foreign lips, yet even then they still will not listen to me, says the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So then, tongues are not a sign for believers, but a miracle for unbelievers. Prophecy, on the other hand, is not for unbelievers, but a miracle sign for believers.</verse>
				<verse number="23">If the entire church comes together and everyone is speaking in tongues, won’t the visitors say that you have lost your minds?</verse>
				<verse number="24">But if everyone is prophesying, and an unbeliever or one without the gift enters your meeting, he will be convicted by all that he hears and will be called to account,</verse>
				<verse number="25">for the intimate secrets of his heart will be brought to light. He will be mystified and fall facedown in worship and say, “God is truly among you!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Beloved friends, what does all this imply? When you conduct your meetings, you should always let everything be done to build up the church family. Whether you share a song of praise, a teaching, a divine revelation, or a tongue and interpretation, let each one contribute what strengthens others.</verse>
				<verse number="27">If someone speaks in a tongue, it should be two or three, one after another, with someone interpreting.</verse>
				<verse number="28">If there’s no one with the interpretation, then he should remain silent in the meeting, content to speak to himself and to God.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And the same with prophecy. Let two or three prophets prophesy and let the other prophets carefully evaluate and discern what is being said.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But if someone receives a revelation while someone else is still speaking, the one speaking should conclude and allow the one with fresh revelation the opportunity to share it.</verse>
				<verse number="31">For you can all prophesy in turn and in an environment where all present can be instructed, encouraged, and strengthened.</verse>
				<verse number="32">The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="33">For God is the God of harmony, not confusion, as is the pattern in all the churches of God’s holy believers.</verse>
				<verse number="34">The women should be respectfully silent during the evaluation of prophecy in the meetings. They are not allowed to interrupt, but are to be in a support role, as in fact the law teaches.</verse>
				<verse number="35">If they want to inquire about something, let them ask their husbands when they get home, for a woman embarrasses herself when she constantly interrupts the church meeting.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Do you actually think that you were the starting point for the Word of God going forth? Were you the only ones it was sent to? I don’t think so!</verse>
				<verse number="37">If anyone considers himself to be a prophet or a spiritual person, let him discern that what I’m writing to you carries the Lord’s authority.</verse>
				<verse number="38">And if anyone continues not to recognize this, he should not be recognized!</verse>
				<verse number="39">So, beloved friends, with all this in mind, be passionate to prophesy and don’t forbid anyone from speaking in tongues,</verse>
				<verse number="40">doing all things in a beautiful and orderly way.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Dear friends, let me give you clearly the heart of the gospel that I’ve preached to you—the good news that you have heartily received and on which you stand.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For it is through the revelation of the gospel that you are being saved, if you fasten your life firmly to the message I’ve taught you, unless you have believed in vain.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For I have shared with you what I have received and what is of utmost importance: The Messiah died for our sins, fulfilling the prophecies of the Scriptures.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He was buried in a tomb and was raised from the dead after three days, as foretold in the Scriptures.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then he appeared to Peter the Rock and to the twelve apostles.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He also appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at the same time, most of whom are still alive as I write this, though a few have passed away.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then he appeared to Jacob and to all the apostles.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Last of all he appeared in front of me, like one born prematurely, ripped from the womb.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yes, I am the most insignificant of all the apostles, unworthy even to be called an apostle, because I hunted down believers and persecuted God’s church.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But God’s amazing grace has made me who I am! And his grace to me was not fruitless. In fact, I worked harder than all the rest, yet not in my own strength but God’s, for his empowering grace is poured out upon me.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So this is what we all have taught you, and whether it was through me or someone else, you have now believed the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The message we preach is Christ, who has been raised from the dead. So how could any of you possibly say there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
				<verse number="13">For if there is no such thing as a resurrection from the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And if Christ has not been raised, all of our preaching has been for nothing and your faith is useless.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Moreover, if the dead are not raised, that would mean that we are false witnesses who are misrepresenting God. And that would mean that we have preached a lie, stating that God raised him from the dead, if in reality he didn’t.</verse>
				<verse number="16">If the dead aren’t raised up, that would mean that Christ has not been raised up either.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And if Christ is not alive, you are still lost in your sins and your faith is a fantasy.</verse>
				<verse number="18">It would also mean that those believers in Christ who have passed away have simply perished.</verse>
				<verse number="19">If the only benefit of our hope in Christ is limited to this life on earth, we deserve to be pitied more than all others!</verse>
				<verse number="20">But the truth is, Christ is risen from the dead, as the firstfruit of a great resurrection harvest of those who have died.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For since death came through a man, Adam, it is fitting that the resurrection of the dead has also come through a man, Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Even as all who are in Adam die, so also all who are in Christ will be made alive.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But each one in his proper order: Christ, the firstfruits, then those who belong to Christ in his presence.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then the final stage of completion comes, when he will bring to an end every other rulership, authority, and power, and he will hand over his kingdom to Father God.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Until then he is destined to reign as King until all hostility has been subdued and placed under his feet.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And the last enemy to be subdued and eliminated is death itself.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The Father has placed all things in subjection under the feet of Christ. Yet when it says, “all things,” it is understood that the Father does not include himself, for he is the one who placed all things in subjection to Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="28">However, when everything is subdued and in submission to him, then the Son himself will be subject to the Father, who put all things under his feet. This is so that Father God will be everything in everyone!</verse>
				<verse number="29">If there is no resurrection, what do these people think they’re doing when they are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren’t raised, why be baptized for them?</verse>
				<verse number="30">And why would we be risking our lives every day?</verse>
				<verse number="31">My brothers and sisters, I continually face death. This is as sure as my boasting of you and our co-union together in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ, who gives me confidence to share my experiences with you.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Tell me, why did I fight “wild beasts” in Ephesus if my hope is in this life only? What was the point of that? If the dead do not rise, then Let’s party all night, for tomorrow we die!</verse>
				<verse number="33">So stop fooling yourselves! Evil companions will corrupt good morals and character.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Come back to your right senses and awaken to what is right. Repent from your sinful ways. For some have no knowledge of God’s wonderful love. You should be ashamed that you make me write this way to you!</verse>
				<verse number="35">I can almost hear someone saying, “How can the dead come back to life? And what kind of body will they have when they are resurrected?”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Foolish man! Don’t you know that what you sow in the ground doesn’t germinate unless it dies?</verse>
				<verse number="37">And what you sow is not the body that will come into being, but the bare seed. And it’s hard to tell whether it’s wheat or some other seed.</verse>
				<verse number="38">But when it dies, God gives it a new form, a body to fulfill his purpose, and he sees to it that each seed gets a new body of its own and becomes the plant he designed it to be.</verse>
				<verse number="39">All flesh is not identical. Animals have one flesh and human beings another. Birds have their distinct flesh and fish another.</verse>
				<verse number="40">In the same way there are earthly bodies and heavenly bodies. There is a splendor of the celestial body and a different one for the earthly.</verse>
				<verse number="41">There is the radiance of the sun and differing radiance for the moon and for the stars. Even the stars differ in their shining.</verse>
				<verse number="42">And that’s how it will be with the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="43">The body is “sown” in decay, but will be raised in immortality. It is “sown” in humiliation, but will be raised in glorification.</verse>
				<verse number="44">It is “sown” in weakness but will be raised in power. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
				<verse number="45">For it is written: The first man, Adam, became a living soul. The last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="46">However, the spiritual didn’t come first. The natural precedes the spiritual.</verse>
				<verse number="47">The first man was from the dust of the earth; the second Man is Yahweh, from the realm of heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="48">The first one, made from dust, has a race of people just like him, who are also made from dust. The One sent from heaven has a race of heavenly people who are just like him.</verse>
				<verse number="49">Once we carried the likeness of the man of dust, but now let us carry the likeness of the man of heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="50">Now, I tell you this, my brothers and sisters, flesh and blood are not able to inherit God’s kingdom realm, and neither will that which is decaying be able to inherit what is incorruptible.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Listen, and I will tell you a divine mystery: not all of us will die, but we will all be transformed.</verse>
				<verse number="52">It will happen in an instant —in the twinkling of his eye. For when the last trumpet is sounded, the dead will come back to life. We will be indestructible and we will be transformed.</verse>
				<verse number="53">For we will discard our mortal “clothes” and slip into a body that is imperishable. What is mortal now will be exchanged for immortality.</verse>
				<verse number="54">And when that which is mortal puts on immortality, and what now decays is exchanged for what will never decay, then the Scripture will be fulfilled that says: Death is swallowed up by a triumphant victory!</verse>
				<verse number="55">So death, tell me, where is your victory? Tell me death, where is your sting?</verse>
				<verse number="56">It is sin that gives death its sting and the law that gives sin its power.</verse>
				<verse number="57">But we thank God for giving us the victory as conquerors through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="58">So now, beloved ones, stand firm, stable, and enduring. Live your lives with an unshakable confidence. We know that we prosper and excel in every season by serving the Lord, because we are assured that our union with the Lord makes our labor productive with fruit that endures.</verse>

				<verse number="3">All praises belong to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For he is the Father of tender mercy and the God of endless comfort.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He always comes alongside us to comfort us in every suffering so that we can come alongside those who are in any painful trial. We can bring them this same comfort that God has poured out upon us.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And just as we experience the abundance of Christ’s own sufferings, even more of God’s comfort will cascade upon us through our union with Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="6">If troubles weigh us down, that just means that we will receive even more comfort to pass on to you for your deliverance! For the comfort pouring into us empowers us to bring comfort to you. And with this comfort upholding you, you can endure victoriously the same suffering that we experience.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now our hope for you is unshakable, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings you will also share in God’s comforting strength.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Brothers and sisters, you need to know about the severe trials we experienced while we were in western Turkey. All of the hardships we passed through crushed us beyond our ability to endure, and we were so completely overwhelmed that we were about to give up entirely.</verse>
				<verse number="9">It felt like we had a death sentence written upon our hearts, and we still feel it to this day. It has taught us to lose all faith in ourselves and to place all of our trust in the God who raises the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He has rescued us from terrifying encounters with death. And now we fasten our hopes on him to continue to deliver us from death yet again,</verse>
				<verse number="11">as you labor together with us through prayer. Because there are so many interceding for us, our deliverance will cause even more people to give thanks to God. What a gracious gift of mercy surrounds us because of your prayers!</verse>
				<verse number="12">We rejoice in saying with complete honesty and a clear conscience that God has empowered us to conduct ourselves in a holy manner and with no hidden agenda. God’s marvelous grace enables us to minister to everyone with pure motives, not in the clever wisdom of the world. This is especially true in all of our dealings with you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">We write to you with words that are clearly understood, and there is no need for you to try to read between the lines of what we write in hopes that you can completely and accurately understand our hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="14">We know you have already understood us in a measure and that you will eventually come to understand us fully. Then you’ll be able to boast of us even as we will boast of you in the day of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="15">With this confidence, I’m wanting to visit you before and after my trip to Macedonia so that you enjoy a second experience of grace. Afterward, I’m hoping you will be able to aid me on my journey to Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">When I revised my itinerary, was I vacillating? Or do I make my plans with unprincipled motives, ready to flip-flop with a “yes” and a “no” in the same breath? Of course not!</verse>
				<verse number="18">For as God is true to his word, my promise to you was not a fickle “yes” when I meant “no.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and he is the one whom Timothy, Silas, and I have preached to you—and he has never been both a “yes” and a “no.” He has always been and always will be for us a resounding “YES!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">For all of God’s promises find their “yes” of fulfillment in him. And as his “yes” and our “amen” ascend to God, we bring him glory!</verse>
				<verse number="21">Now, it is God himself who has anointed us. And he is constantly strengthening both you and us in union with Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="22">He knows we are his since he has also stamped his seal of love over our hearts and has given us the Holy Spirit like an engagement ring is given to a bride—a down payment of the blessings to come!</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now, I call upon this faithful God as a witness against me if I’m not telling you the absolute truth. It was because I hold you in my heart that I decided not to return to Corinth, in order to spare you the humiliation of my rebuke.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But I don’t want to imply that as leaders we coerce you or somehow want to rule over your faith. Instead, we are your partners who are called to increase your joy. And we know that you already stand firm because of your strong faith.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">So until these issues were settled, I decided against paying you another painful visit.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For if I brought you pain, you would be unable to bring me joy.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And this was the very point I made in my letter, for I didn’t want to come and find sadness filling the very ones who should give me cheer. But I’m confident that you will do what’s right so that my joyous delight will be yours.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I wrote you previously sobbing and with a broken heart. I was filled with anguish and deep distress. I had no intention of causing you pain but to convey the overwhelming measure of my love for you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For the one who has caused me grief has not only grieved me but, to some extent, has caused you all grief as well.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I believe that your united rebuke has been punishment enough for him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Instead of more punishment, what he needs most is your encouragement through your gracious display of forgiveness.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I beg you to reaffirm your deep love for him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You see, I wrote previously in order to see if your hearts would pass the test and if you were willing to follow my counsel in everything.</verse>
				<verse number="10">If you freely forgive anyone for anything, then I also forgive him. And if I have forgiven anything, I did so for you before the face of Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="11">so that we would not be exploited by the adversary, Satan, for we know his clever schemes.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When I arrived at Troas, bringing the wonderful news of Christ, the Lord opened a great door of opportunity to minister there.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Still, I had no peace of mind, because I couldn’t find my dear brother Titus anywhere. So after saying goodbye to the believers, I set out for Macedonia to look for him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">God always makes his grace visible in Christ, who includes us as partners of his endless triumph. Through our yielded lives he spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere we go.</verse>
				<verse number="15">We have become the unmistakable aroma of the victory of the Anointed One to God —a perfume of life to those being saved and the odor of death to those who are perishing.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The unbelievers smell a deadly stench that leads to death, but believers smell the life-giving aroma that leads to abundant life. And who of us can rise to this challenge?</verse>
				<verse number="17">For unlike so many, we are not peddlers of God’s Word who water down the message. We are those sent from God with pure motives, who speak in the sight of God from our union with Christ.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Are we beginning to sound like those who speak highly of themselves? Do you really need letters of recommendation to validate our ministry, like others do? Do we really need your letter of endorsement? Of course not!</verse>
				<verse number="2">For your very lives are our “letters of recommendation,” permanently engraved on our hearts, recognized and read by everybody.</verse>
				<verse number="3">As a result of our ministry, you are living letters written by Christ, not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God—not carved onto stone tablets but on the tablets of tender hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="4">We carry this confidence in our hearts because of our union with Christ before God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yet we don’t see ourselves as capable enough to do anything in our own strength, for our true competence flows from God’s empowering presence.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He alone makes us adequate ministers who are focused on an entirely new covenant. Our ministry is not based on the letter of the law but through the power of the Spirit. The letter of the law kills, but the Spirit pours out life.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Even the ministry that was characterized by chiseled letters on stone tablets came with a dazzling measure of glory, though it produced death. The Israelites couldn’t bear to gaze on the glowing face of Moses because of the radiant splendor shining from his countenance—a glory destined to fade away.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yet how much more radiant is this new and glorious ministry of the Spirit that shines from us!</verse>
				<verse number="9">For if the former ministry of condemnation was ushered in with a measure of glory, how much more does the ministry that imparts righteousness far excel in glory.</verse>
				<verse number="10">What once was glorious no longer holds any glory because of the increasingly greater glory that has replaced it.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The fading ministry came with a portion of glory, but now we embrace the unfading ministry of a permanent impartation of glory.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So then, with this amazing hope living in us, we step out in freedom and boldness to speak the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="13">We are not like Moses, who used a veil to hide the glory to keep the Israelites from staring at him as it faded away.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Their minds were closed and hardened, for even to this day that same veil comes over their minds when they hear the words of the former covenant. The veil has not yet been lifted from them, for it is only eliminated when one is joined to the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So until now, whenever the Old Testament is being read, the same blinding comes over their hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But the moment one turns to the Lord with an open heart, the veil is lifted and they see.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now, the “Lord” I’m referring to is the Holy Spirit, and wherever he is Lord, there is freedom.</verse>
				<verse number="18">We can all draw close to him with the veil removed from our faces. And with no veil we all become like mirrors who brightly reflect the glory of the Lord Jesus. We are being transfigured into his very image as we move from one brighter level of glory to another. And this glorious transfiguration comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Now, it’s because of God’s mercy that we have been entrusted with the privilege of this new covenant ministry. And we will not quit or faint with weariness.</verse>
				<verse number="2">We reject every shameful cover-up and refuse to resort to cunning trickery or distorting the Word of God. Instead, we open up our souls to you by presenting the truth to everyone’s conscience in the sight and presence of God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Even if our gospel message is veiled, it is only veiled to those who are perishing,</verse>
				<verse number="4">for their minds have been blinded by the god of this age, leaving them in unbelief. Their blindness keeps them from seeing the dayspring light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the divine image of God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">We don’t preach ourselves, but rather the lordship of Jesus Christ, for we are your servants for Jesus’ sake.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For God, who said, “Let brilliant light shine out of darkness,” is the one who has cascaded his light into us—the brilliant dawning light of the glorious knowledge of God as we gaze into the face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="7">We are like common clay jars that carry this glorious treasure within, so that this immeasurable power will be seen as God’s, not ours.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Though we experience every kind of pressure, we’re not crushed. At times we don’t know what to do, but quitting is not an option.</verse>
				<verse number="9">We are persecuted by others, but God has not forsaken us. We may be knocked down, but not out.</verse>
				<verse number="10">We continually share in the death of Jesus in our own bodies so that the resurrection life of Jesus will be revealed through our humanity.</verse>
				<verse number="11">We consider living to mean that we are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake so that the life of Jesus will be revealed through our humanity.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So, then, death is at work in us but it releases life in you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">We have the same Spirit of faith that is described in the Scriptures when it says, “First I believed, then I spoke in faith.” So we also first believe then speak in faith.</verse>
				<verse number="14">We do this because we are convinced that he who raised Jesus will raise us up with him, and together we will all be brought into his presence.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yes, all things work for your enrichment so that more of God’s marvelous grace will spread to more and more people, resulting in an even greater increase of praise to God, bringing him even more glory!</verse>
				<verse number="16">So no wonder we don’t give up. For even though our outer person gradually wears out, our inner being is renewed every single day.</verse>
				<verse number="17">We view our slight, short-lived troubles in the light of eternity. We see our difficulties as the substance that produces for us an eternal, weighty glory far beyond all comparison,</verse>
				<verse number="18">because we don’t focus our attention on what is seen but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but the unseen realm is eternal.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">We are convinced that even if these bodies we live in are folded up at death like tents, we will still have a God-built home that no human hands have built, which will last forever in the heavenly realm.</verse>
				<verse number="2">We inwardly sigh as we live in these physical “ tents,” longing to put on a new body for our life in heaven,</verse>
				<verse number="3">in the belief that once we put on our new “clothing” we won’t find ourselves “naked.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So, while living in this “tent,” we groan under its burden, not because we want to die but because we want these new bodies. We crave for all that is mortal to be swallowed up by eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And this is no empty hope, for God himself is the one who has prepared us for this wonderful destiny. And to confirm this promise, he has given us the Holy Spirit, like an engagement ring, as a guarantee.</verse>
				<verse number="6">That’s why we’re always full of courage. Even while we’re at home in the body, we’re homesick to be with the Master—</verse>
				<verse number="7">for we live by faith, not by what we see with our eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="8">We live with a joyful confidence, yet at the same time we take delight in the thought of leaving our bodies behind to be at home with the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So whether we live or die we make it our life’s passion to live our lives pleasing to him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For one day we will all be openly revealed before Christ on his throne so that each of us will be duly recompensed for our actions done in life, whether good or worthless.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Since we are those who stand in holy awe of the Lord, we make it our passion to persuade others to turn to him. We know that our lives are transparent before the God who knows us fully, and I hope that we are also well known to your consciences.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Again, we are not taking an opportunity to brag, but giving you information that will enable you to be proud of us, and to answer those who esteem outward appearances while overlooking what is in the heart.</verse>
				<verse number="13">If we are out of our minds in a blissful, divine ecstasy, it is for God, but if we are in our right minds, it is for your benefit.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For it is Christ’s love that fuels our passion and holds us tightly, because we are convinced that he has given his life for all of us. This means all died with him,</verse>
				<verse number="15">so that those who live should no longer live self-absorbed lives but lives that are poured out for him—the one who died for us and now lives again.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So, from now on, we refuse to evaluate people merely by their outward appearances. For that’s how we once viewed the Anointed One, but no longer do we see him with limited human insight.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now, if anyone is enfolded into Christ, he has become an entirely new person. All that is related to the old order has vanished. Behold, everything is fresh and new.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And God has made all things new, and reconciled us to himself, and given us the ministry of reconciling others to God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">In other words, it was through the Anointed One that God was shepherding the world, not even keeping records of their transgressions, and he has entrusted to us the ministry of opening the door of reconciliation to God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">We are ambassadors of the Anointed One who carry the message of Christ to the world, as though God were tenderly pleading with them directly through our lips. So we tenderly plead with you on Christ’s behalf, “Turn back to God and be reconciled to him.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">For God made the only one who did not know sin to become sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God through our union with him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Now, since we are God’s coworkers, we beg you not to take God’s marvelous grace for granted, allowing it to have no effect on your lives.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For he says, I listened to you at the time of my favor. And the day when you needed salvation, I came to your aid. So can’t you see? Now is the time to respond to his favor! Now is the day of salvation!</verse>
				<verse number="3">We will not place obstacles in anyone’s way that hinder them from coming to salvation so that our ministry will not be discredited.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yet, as God’s servants, we prove ourselves authentic in every way. For example: We have great endurance in hardships and in persecutions. We don’t lose courage in a time of stress and calamity.</verse>
				<verse number="5">We’ve been beaten many times, imprisoned, and found ourselves in the midst of riots. We’ve endured many troubles, had sleepless nights, and gone hungry.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We have proved ourselves by our lifestyles of purity, by our spiritual insights, by our patience, and by showing kindness, by the Spirit of holiness and by our uncritical love for you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">We commend ourselves to you by our truthful teachings, by the power of God working through us, and with the mighty weapons of righteousness— a sword in one hand and a shield in the other.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Amid honor or dishonor, slander or praise— even when we are treated as deceivers and imposters— we remain steadfast and true.</verse>
				<verse number="9">We are unknown nobodies whom everyone knows. We are frequently at death’s door, yet here we are, still alive! We have been severely punished yet not executed.</verse>
				<verse number="10">We may suffer, yet in every season we are always found rejoicing. We may be poor, yet we bestow great riches on many. We seem to have nothing, yet in reality we possess all things.</verse>
				<verse number="11">My friends at Corinth, our hearts are wide open to you and we speak freely, holding nothing back from you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If there is a block in our relationship, it is not with us, for we carry you in our hearts with great love, yet you still withhold your affections from us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So I speak to you as our children. Make room in your hearts for us as we have done for you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Don’t continue to team up with unbelievers in mismatched alliances, for what partnership is there between righteousness and rebellion? Who could mingle light with darkness?</verse>
				<verse number="15">What harmony can there be between Christ and Satan? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?</verse>
				<verse number="16">What friendship does God’s temple have with demons? For indeed, we are the temple of the living God, just as God has said: I will make my home in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For this reason, “Come out from among them and be separate,” says the Lord. “Touch nothing that is unclean, and I will embrace you.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I will be a true Father to you, and you will be my beloved sons and daughters,” says the Lord Yahweh Almighty.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Beloved ones, with promises like these, and because of our deepest respect and worship of God, we must remove everything from our lives that contaminates body and spirit, and continue to complete the development of holiness within us.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Again, I urge you, make room for us in your hearts, for we have wronged no one, corrupted no one, and taken advantage of no one.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I’m not saying this to condemn you, for I already told you that we carry you permanently in our hearts—and you’ll stay there throughout our lives, for we will live together and die together.</verse>
				<verse number="4">With an open heart let me freely say how very proud I am of you and how often I boast about you. In fact, when I think of you my heart is greatly encouraged and overwhelmed with joy, despite our many troubles.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Even after we came into the province of Macedonia, we found no relief. We were restless and exhausted; troubles met us at every turn. Outwardly I faced conflicts and inwardly emotional turmoil.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But God, who always knows how to encourage the depressed, encouraged us greatly by the arrival of Titus.</verse>
				<verse number="7">We were relieved not only to see him but because of the report he brought us of how you refreshed his heart. He told us of your affection toward me, your deep remorse, and how concerned you were for me. This truly made my heart leap for joy!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Even if my letter made you sorrowful, I don’t regret sending it (even though I felt awful for a moment when I heard how it grieved you).</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now I’m overjoyed—not because I made you sad, but because your grief led you to a deep repentance. You experienced godly sorrow, and as God intended, it brought about gain for you, not loss, so that no harm has been done by us.</verse>
				<verse number="10">God designed us to feel remorse over sin in order to produce repentance that leads to victory. This leaves us with no regrets. But the sorrow of the world works death.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Can’t you see the good fruit that has come, as God intended, because of your remorse over sin? Now you are eager to do what is right! Look at the indignation you experienced over what happened and how alarmed you became. What holy longing it awakened, what passion for God, and how ready you were to bring justice to the offender. Your response has proved that you are free of blame in this matter.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So I wrote you not simply to correct the one who did the wrong or on the behalf of the one who was wronged, but to help you realize in God’s sight how loyal you are to us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Your response leaves us so encouraged! You’ve made us even more joyful upon hearing of how you refreshed Titus, for his mind was set at ease by all of you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I have not been embarrassed by you, for the things I bragged about you to Titus were not proven false. Just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has proven to be true as well.</verse>
				<verse number="15">His affection toward you has grown as he remembers your obedience and how warmly you welcomed him with fear and trembling.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I’m beside myself with joy! I am so confident in you!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Beloved ones, we must tell you about the grace God poured out upon the churches of Macedonia.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For even during a season of severe difficulty, tremendous suffering, and extreme poverty, their super-abundant joy overflowed into an act of extravagant generosity.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For I can verify that they spontaneously gave, not only according to their means but far beyond what they could afford.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They actually begged us for the privilege of sharing in this ministry of giving to God’s holy people who are living in poverty.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They exceeded our expectations by first dedicating themselves fully to the Lord and then to us, according to God’s pleasure.</verse>
				<verse number="6">That is why we appealed to Titus, since he was the one who got you started and encouraged you to give, so he could help you complete this generous undertaking on your behalf.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You do well and excel in every respect—in unstoppable faith, in powerful preaching, in revelation knowledge, in your passionate devotion, and in sharing the love we have shown to you. So make sure that you also excel in grace-filled generosity.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I’m not saying this as though I were issuing an order but to stir you to greater love by mentioning the enthusiasm of the Macedonians as a challenge to you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For you have experienced the extravagant grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was infinitely rich, he impoverished himself for our sake, so that by his poverty, we become rich beyond measure.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So here are my thoughts concerning this matter, and it’s in your best interests. Since you made such a good start last year, both in the grace of giving and in your longing to give,</verse>
				<verse number="11">you should finish what you started. You were so eager in your intentions to give, so go do it. Finish this act of worship according to your ability to give.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For if the intention and desire are there, the size of the gift doesn’t matter. Your gift is fully acceptable to God according to what you have, not what you don’t have.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I’m not saying this in order to ease someone else’s load by overloading you, but as a matter of fair balance.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Your surplus could meet their need, and their abundance may one day meet your need. This equal sharing of abundance will mean a fair balance.</verse>
				<verse number="15">As it is written: The one who gathered much didn’t have too much, and the one who gathered little didn’t have too little.</verse>
				<verse number="16">We give thanks to God for putting the same devotion I have for you into the heart of Titus.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Of course, he enthusiastically accepted our request to go to Corinth, but because he carries you in his heart, he’d already planned on coming.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So we’re sending with him the brother who is greatly honored and respected in all the churches for his work of evangelism.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Not only that, he has been appointed by the churches to be our traveling companion as we carry and dispense this generous gift that glorifies the Lord and shows how eager we are to help.</verse>
				<verse number="20">We are sending a team in order to avoid any criticism over how we handle this wonderfully generous gift,</verse>
				<verse number="21">for we intend to do what is right and we are totally open both to the Lord’s inspection and to man’s.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So we’re sending with them another brother who is faithful and proven to be a man of integrity. He is passionate to help you now more than ever, for he believes in you.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Concerning the credentials of Titus, he’s my partner and coworker in ministry for you. As for the brothers coming with him, they are apostles of the churches, which are the glory of the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So demonstrate to them how much you love, and prove that our boasting of you is justified.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Actually, there’s no need to write to you about this contribution for the holy believers in Jerusalem,</verse>
				<verse number="2">for I already know that you are on board and eager to help. I keep boasting to the churches of Macedonia about your passion to give, telling them that the believers of Corinth have been preparing to give for a year. Your enthusiasm is contagious—it has stirred many of them to do likewise.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Still, I thought it would be best to send these brothers to receive the offering that you’ve prepared, so that our boasting about how you were ready to give would not be found hollow.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For if, after boasting of our confidence in you, some of the Macedonians were to come with me and find that you were not prepared, we would be embarrassed—to say nothing of you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">That’s why I’ve requested that the brothers come before I do and make arrangements in advance for the substantial offering you pledged. Then it will be seen as a matter of generosity and not under pressure, as something you felt forced to do.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Here’s my point. A stingy sower will reap a meager harvest, but the one who sows from a generous spirit will reap an abundant harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Let giving flow from your heart, not from a sense of religious duty. Let it spring up freely from the joy of giving—all because God loves hilarious generosity!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yes, God is more than ready to overwhelm you with every form of grace, so that you will have more than enough of everything —every moment and in every way. He will make you overflow with abundance in every good thing you do.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Just as the Scriptures say about the one who trusts in him: Because he has sown extravagantly and given to the poor, his kindness and generous deeds will never be forgotten.</verse>
				<verse number="10">This generous God who supplies abundant seed for the farmer, which becomes bread for our meals, is even more extravagant toward you. First he supplies every need, plus more. Then he multiplies the seed as you sow it, so that the harvest of your generosity will grow.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You will be abundantly enriched in every way as you give generously on every occasion, for when we take your gifts to those in need, it causes many to give thanks to God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The priestly ministry you are providing through your offering not only supplies what is lacking for God’s people, it inspires an outpouring of praises and thanksgiving to God himself.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For as your extremely generous offering meets the approval of those in Jerusalem, it will cause them to give glory to God—all because of your loyal support and allegiance to the gospel of Christ, as well as your generous-hearted partnership with them toward those in need.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Because of this extraordinary grace, which God has lavished on you, they will affectionately remember you in their prayers.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Praise God for his astonishing gift, which is far too great for words!</verse>

				<verse number="1">Now, please listen, for I need to address an issue. I’m making this personal appeal to you by the gentleness and self-forgetfulness of Christ. I am the one who is “humble and timid” when face-to-face with you but “bold and outspoken” when a safe distance away.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now I plead with you that when I come, don’t force me to take a hard line with you (which I’m willing to do) by daring to confront those who mistakenly believe that we are living by the standards of the world, not by the Spirit’s wisdom and power.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For although we live in the natural realm, we don’t wage a military campaign employing human weapons, using manipulation to achieve our aims. Instead, our spiritual weapons are energized with divine power to effectively dismantle the defenses behind which people hide.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">We can demolish every deceptive fantasy that opposes God and break through every arrogant attitude that is raised up in defiance of the true knowledge of God. We capture, like prisoners of war, every thought and insist that it bow in obedience to the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Since we are armed with such dynamic weaponry, we stand ready to punish any trace of rebellion, as soon as you choose complete obedience.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You seem to always be looking at people by their outward appearances. If someone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself of this: we belong to Christ no less than he does.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I am not ashamed, even if I’ve come across as one who has overstated the authority given to us by the Lord. For it is the authority to help build you up, not tear you down.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I don’t want to seem as though I’m trying to bully you with my letters.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For I can imagine some of you saying, “His letters are authoritative and stern, but when he’s with us he’s not that impressive and he’s a poor speaker.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Such a person should realize that when we arrive, there will be no difference in the actions we take and the words we write.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Of course, we wouldn’t dare to put ourselves in the same class or compare ourselves with those who rate themselves so highly. They compare themselves to one another and make up their own standards to measure themselves by, and then they judge themselves by their own standards. What self-delusion!</verse>
				<verse number="13">But we are those who choose to limit our boasting to only the measure of the work to which God has appointed us—a measure that, by the way, has reached as far as you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And since you are within our assigned limits, we didn’t overstep our boundaries of authority by being the first to announce to you the wonderful news of the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="15">We’re not trying to take credit for the ministry done by others, going beyond the limits God set for us. Instead, our hope soars as your faith continues to grow, causing a great expansion of our ministry among you.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then we can go and preach the good news in the regions beyond you without trespassing on the ministry sphere of other laborers and what they have already done.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For: The one who boasts must boast in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So let’s be clear. To have the Lord’s approval and commendation is of greater value than bragging about oneself.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Now, please bear with some of my “craziness” for a moment. Yes, please be patient with me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">You need to know that God’s passion is burning inside me for you, because, like a loving father, I have pledged your hand in marriage to Christ, your true bridegroom. I’ve also promised that I would present his fiancée to him as a pure virgin bride.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But now I’m afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s clever lies, your thoughts may be corrupted and you may lose your single-hearted devotion and pure love for Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For you seem to gladly tolerate anyone who comes to you preaching a pseudo-Jesus, not the Jesus we have preached. You have accepted a spirit and gospel that is false, rather than the Spirit and gospel you once embraced. How tolerant you have become of these imposters!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now, I believe that I am not inferior in any way to these special “super-apostles” you are attracted to.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For although I may not be a polished or eloquent speaker, I’m certainly not an amateur in revelation knowledge. Indeed, we have demonstrated this to you time and again.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Have I committed a sin by degrading myself to dignify you? Was I wrong to preach the gospel of God to you free of charge?</verse>
				<verse number="8">I received ample financial support from other churches just so that I could freely serve you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Remember, when I was with you I didn’t bother anyone when I needed money, for my needs were always supplied by my Macedonian friends. So I was careful, and will continue to be careful, that I never become a burden to you in any way.</verse>
				<verse number="10">As the reality of Christ lives within me, my glad boast of offering the gospel free of charge will not be silenced throughout the region of Achaia.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Why? Is it because I have no love for you? God knows how much I love you!</verse>
				<verse number="12">But in order to eliminate the opportunity for those “super-apostles” to boast that their ministry is on the same level as ours I will continue this practice.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For they are not true apostles but deceitful ministers who masquerade as “special apostles” of the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="14">That doesn’t surprise us, for even Satan transforms himself to appear as an angel of light!</verse>
				<verse number="15">So it’s no wonder his servants also go about pretending to be ministers of righteousness. But in the end they will be exposed and get exactly what they deserve.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So I repeat. Let no one think that I’m a fool. But if you do, at least show me the patience you would show a fool, so that I too may boast a little.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Of course, what I’m about to tell you is not with the Lord’s authority, but as a “fool.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">For since many love to boast about their worldly achievements, allow me the opportunity to join them.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And since you are so smart and so wise to gladly put up with the foolishness of others, now put up with mine.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You actually allow these imposters to put you into bondage, take complete advantage of you, and rob you blind! How easily you endure those who, in their arrogance, destroy your dignity or even slap you in the face.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I must admit, to our shame that we were too “weak” to relate to you the way they do. But now let me dare to boast like a “fool.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Are these “super-apostles” of yours Hebrews? I am too. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? Me too!</verse>
				<verse number="23">Are they servants of the Anointed One? I’m beside myself when I speak this way, but I am much more of a servant than they. I have worked much harder for God, taken more beatings, and been dragged to more prisons than they. I’ve been flogged excessively, multiple times, even to the point of death.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Five times I’ve received thirty-nine lashes from the Jewish leaders.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Three times I experienced being beaten with rods. Once they stoned me. Three times I’ve been shipwrecked; for an entire night and a day I was adrift in the open sea.</verse>
				<verse number="26">In my difficult travels I’ve faced many dangerous situations: perilous rivers, robbers, foreigners, and even my own people. I’ve survived deadly peril in the city, in the wilderness, with storms at sea, and with spies posing as believers.</verse>
				<verse number="27">I’ve toiled to the point of exhaustion and gone through many sleepless nights. I’ve frequently been deprived of food and water, left hungry and shivering out in the cold, lacking proper clothing.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And besides these painful circumstances, I have the daily pressure of my responsibility for all the churches, with a deep concern weighing heavily on my heart for their welfare.</verse>
				<verse number="29">I am not aloof, for who is desperate and weak and I do not feel their weakness? Who is led astray into sin and I do not burn with zeal to restore him?</verse>
				<verse number="30">If boasting is necessary, I will boast about examples of my weakness.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is eternally praised, knows that I am speaking the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Once, when I was in Damascus, the governor under King Aretas had his troops searching for me to have me arrested,</verse>
				<verse number="33">but I was stuffed in a basket and lowered down through a window and managed to escape.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Although it may not accomplish a thing, I need to move on and boast about supernatural visions and revelations of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Someone I’m acquainted with, who is in union with Christ, was swept away fourteen years ago in an ecstatic experience. He was taken into the third heaven, but I’m not sure if he was in his body or out of his body—only God knows.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And I know that this man (again, I’m not sure if he was still in his body or taken out of his body—God knows)</verse>
				<verse number="4">was caught up in an ecstatic experience and brought into paradise, where he overheard many wondrous and inexpressible secrets that were so sacred that no mortal is permitted to repeat them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I’m ready to boast of such an experience, but for my own good I refuse to boast unless it concerns my weaknesses.</verse>
				<verse number="6">However, if I were to boast, it wouldn’t be ridiculous at all, for I would be speaking the truth. Yet I will refrain, lest others think higher of me than what I demonstrate with my life and teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The extraordinary level of the revelations I’ve received is no reason for anyone to exalt me. For this is why a thorn in my flesh was given to me, the Adversary’s messenger sent to harass me, keeping me from becoming arrogant.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Three times I pleaded with the Lord to relieve me of this.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But he answered me, “My grace is always more than enough for you, and my power finds its full expression through your weakness.” So I will celebrate my weaknesses, for when I’m weak I sense more deeply the mighty power of Christ living in me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So I’m not defeated by my weakness, but delighted! For when I feel my weakness and endure mistreatment—when I’m surrounded with troubles on every side and face persecution because of my love for Christ—I am made yet stronger. For my weakness becomes a portal to God’s power.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I have become foolish to boast like this, but you have forced me to do it, when you should have boasted in me instead. For there is nothing I lack compared to these “super-apostles” of yours, even though I am nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The things that distinguish a true apostle were performed among you with great perseverance—supernatural signs, startling wonders, and awesome miracles.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Furthermore, how were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I didn’t burden you financially—forgive me for depriving you!</verse>
				<verse number="14">And now here I am, ready to come to you for the third time, and I still refuse to be a burden to you. For what I really want is your hearts, not your money. After all, children should not have to accumulate resources for their parents, but parents do this for their children.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And as a spiritual father to you, I will gladly spend all that I have and all that I am for you! If I love you more, will you respond by loving me less?</verse>
				<verse number="16">Be that as it may, I haven’t been a burden to you at all, yet you say of me, “He’s a scoundrel and a trickster!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">But let me ask you this. Did I somehow cheat or trick you through any of the men I sent your way?</verse>
				<verse number="18">I was the one who insisted that Titus and our brother come and help you. Did Titus take advantage of you? Didn’t we all come to you in the same spirit, following in the ways of integrity?</verse>
				<verse number="19">I hope that you don’t assume that all this time we have simply been justifying ourselves in your eyes? Beloved ones, we have been speaking to you in the sight of God as those joined to Christ, and everything we do is meant to build you up and make you stronger in your faith.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now I’m afraid that when I come to you I may find you different than I desire you to be, and you may find me different than you would like me to be. I don’t want to find you in disunity, with jealousy and angry outbursts, with selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance, and turmoil.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I’m actually afraid that on my next visit my God will humble me in front of you as I shed tears over those who keep sinning without repenting of their impurity, sexual immorality, and perversion.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">This will be my third trip to you. And I will make sure that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter will be confirmed.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Since you are demanding proof that the Anointed One is speaking through me, I will give you proof by exercising discipline among you. For just as I told you the last time I was there—and now, though absent, I say it again—that when I come I will not go easy on those whom I’ve already warned and those who continue to persist in their sin. Christ is not weak or feeble in his dealings with you but mighty and powerful within you.</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">For although he was crucified as a “weakling,” now he lives robed with God’s power. And we also are “weak ones” in our co-crucifixion with him, but now we live in God’s triumphant power together with him, which is demonstrated on your behalf.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now your souls will be strengthened and healed if you hold steadfast to your faith. Haven’t you already experienced Jesus Christ himself living in you? If not, you are deficient.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I hope you understand that we cannot be devalued.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But we pray to God that you will be flawless, not to validate our ministry among you but so that you may continue on the path of righteousness even if we are denigrated.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For in reality, the power we have is used in support of the truth, not against it.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And we claim before God that you will be fully equipped and mature, for it brings us great joy when you are strong, even if we seem weak and denigrated.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I’m writing my honest feelings to you from afar so that when I arrive I won’t have to correct you by using the authority the Lord has given me, for I want to build you up and not tear you down.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Finally, beloved friends, be cheerful! Repair whatever is broken among you, as your hearts are being knit together in perfect unity. Live continually in peace, and God, the source of love and peace, will mingle with you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Greet and embrace one another with the sacred kiss.</verse>
				<verse number="13">All of God’s holy people send their greetings.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now, may the grace and joyous favor of the Lord Jesus Christ, the unambiguous love of God, and the precious communion that we share in the Holy Spirit be yours continually. Amen!</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ. My apostleship was not granted to me by men, for I was appointed by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="2">All the brothers and sisters join with me as I write this letter to the churches throughout the region of central Turkey.</verse>
				<verse number="3">May God’s undeserved kindness and total well-being that flow from our Father God and from the Lord Jesus be yours.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He’s the Anointed One who offered himself as the sacrifice for our sins! He has rescued us from this evil world system and set us free, just as our Father God desired.</verse>
				<verse number="5">May all the glory be to God alone, throughout time and eternity. Amen!</verse>
				<verse number="6">I am shocked over how quickly you have strayed away from the One who called you in the grace of Christ. I’m astounded that you now embrace a distorted gospel!</verse>
				<verse number="7">That is a fake “gospel” that is simply not true. There is only one gospel—the good news of Christ! Yet you have allowed those who mingle law with grace to confuse you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel different than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Let me make it clear: Anyone, no matter who they are, that brings you a different gospel than the gospel that you have received, let them be condemned and cursed!</verse>
				<verse number="10">I’m obviously not trying to flatter you or water down my message to be popular with men, but my supreme passion is to please God. For if all I attempt to do is please people, I would fail to be a true servant of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Beloved ones, let me repeat emphatically that the gospel entrusted to me was not given to me by any man.</verse>
				<verse number="12">No one taught me this revelation, for it was given to me directly by the unveiling of Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="13">By now you have heard stories of how severely I harassed and persecuted Christians and how systematically I endeavored to destroy God’s church, all because of my radical devotion to the Jewish religion.</verse>
				<verse number="14">My zeal and passion for the doctrines of Judaism distinguished me among my people, for I was far more advanced in my religious instruction than others my age.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But then God called me by his grace, and chose me from my birth to be his.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He was pleased to unveil his Son in me so that I would proclaim him to the peoples of the world. After I had this encounter, I kept it a secret for some time, sharing it with no one.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And I had no desire to run to Jerusalem and try to impress those who had become apostles before me. Instead, I withdrew into the Arabian Desert. Then I returned to Damascus, where I had first encountered Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I remained there for three years until I eventually went up to Jerusalem, met the apostle Peter, and stayed with him for a couple of weeks.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The only other apostle I met during that time was Jacob, the Lord’s brother.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Everything I’m describing to you I confess before God to be the absolute truth.</verse>
				<verse number="21">After my stay in Jerusalem, I went to Syria and southeast Turkey,</verse>
				<verse number="22">but I remained unknown to the churches in Judea.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The only thing they heard about me was this: “Our former enemy, who once brutally persecuted us, is now preaching the good news of the faith that he tried to destroy!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Because of the transformation that took place in my life, they praised God even more!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Fourteen years later, I returned to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas and Titus, my coworkers.</verse>
				<verse number="2">God gave me a clear revelation to go and confer with the other apostles concerning the message of grace I was preaching to the gentiles. I spoke privately with those who were viewed as senior leaders of the church, wanting to make certain that my labor and ministry for the Messiah had not been based on a false understanding of the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Even though Titus was a Syrian, they accepted him as a brother without demanding that he first be circumcised.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I met with them privately because false “brothers” had been secretly smuggled into church meetings. They were sent to spy on the wonderful freedom that we have in Jesus Christ. Their agenda was to bring us back into the bondage of religion.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But you must know that we did not submit to their religious shackles, not even for a moment, so that we might keep the truth of the gospel of grace unadulterated for you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Even those most influential among the brothers were not able to add anything to my message. Who they are before men makes no difference to me, for God is not impressed by their reputations.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So they recognized that I was entrusted with taking the gospel to the gentiles just as Peter was entrusted with taking it to the Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For the same God who empowered Peter’s apostolic ministry to the Jews also flowed through me as an apostle to those who are gentiles.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When they all recognized this grace operating in my ministry, those who were recognized as influential pillars in the church—Jacob, Peter, and John—extended to Barnabas and me the warmth of Christian fellowship and honored my calling to minister to the gentiles, even as they were to go to the Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They simply requested one thing of me: that I would remember the poor and needy, which was the burden I was already carrying in my heart.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When Peter visited Antioch, he caused the believers to stumble over his behavior, so I confronted him to his face.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He enjoyed eating with the gentile believers who didn’t keep the Jewish customs—up until the time Jacob’s Jewish friends arrived from Jerusalem. When he saw them, he withdrew from his gentile friends—fearing how it would look to them if he ate with gentile believers.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And so, because of Peter’s hypocrisy, many other Jewish believers followed suit, refusing to eat with gentile believers. Even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocritical behavior!</verse>
				<verse number="14">So when I realized they were acting inconsistently with the revelation of the gospel, I confronted Peter in front of everyone: “You were born a Jew, but you’ve chosen to disregard Jewish regulations and live like a gentile. Why then do you force gentiles to conform to these same rules?”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Although we’re Jews by birth and not gentile “sinners,”</verse>
				<verse number="16">we know that no one receives God’s perfect righteousness as a reward for keeping the law, but only by the faith of Jesus, the Messiah! His faithfulness has saved us, and we have received God’s perfect righteousness. Now we know that God accepts no one by the keeping of religious laws!</verse>
				<verse number="17">If we are those who desire to be righteous through our union with the Anointed One, does that mean our Messiah condones sin even though we acknowledge that we are sinners? How absurd!</verse>
				<verse number="18">For if I start over and reconstruct the old religious system that I had torn down with the message of grace, I would appear to be a lawbreaker.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">My old identity has been co-crucified with Christ and no longer lives. And now the essence of this new life is no longer mine, for the Anointed One lives his life through me— we live in union as one! My new life is empowered by the faith of the Son of God who loves me so much that he gave himself for me, dispensing his life into mine!</verse>
				<verse number="21">So that is why I don’t view God’s grace as something peripheral. For if keeping the law could release God’s righteousness to us, then Christ would have died for nothing.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">What has happened to you foolish Galatians? Who has put you under an evil spell? Did God not open your eyes to see the meaning of Jesus’ crucifixion? Was he not revealed to you as the crucified one?</verse>
				<verse number="2">So answer me this: Did the Holy Spirit come to you as a reward for keeping Jewish laws? No, you received him as a gift because you believed in the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Your new life began when the Holy Spirit gave you a new birth. Why then would you so foolishly turn from living in the Spirit by trying to finish by your own works?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Have you endured so many trials and persecutions for nothing?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Let me ask you again: What does the lavish supply of the Holy Spirit in your life and the miracles of God’s tremendous power have to do with you keeping religious laws? The Holy Spirit is poured out upon us through the revelation and power of faith!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Abraham, our father of faith, believed God, and the substance of his faith released God’s righteousness to him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So the true children of Abraham have the same faith as their father!</verse>
				<verse number="8">And the Scripture prophesied that on the basis of faith God would declare gentiles to be righteous. God announced the good news ahead of time to Abraham: “Through your example of faith, all the nations will be blessed!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">And so the blessing of Abraham’s faith is now our blessing too!</verse>
				<verse number="10">But if you rely on works of keeping the law for salvation, you live under the law’s curse. For it is clearly written: “Utterly cursed is everyone who fails to practice every detail and requirement that is written in this law!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">It is obvious that no one achieves the righteousness of God by attempting to keep the law, for it is written: “The one who is in a right relationship with God will live by faith!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">But keeping the law does not require faith, but self-effort. For the law teaches, “If you practice the principles of law, you must follow all of them.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yet, Christ paid the full price to set us free from the curse of the law. He absorbed the curse completely as he became a curse in our place. For it is written: “Everyone who is hung upon a tree is cursed.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Jesus Christ dissolved the curse from our lives, so that in him all the blessings of Abraham can be poured out upon gentiles. And now through faith we receive the promised Holy Spirit who lives in us.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Beloved friends, let me use an illustration that we can all understand. Technically, when a contract is signed, it can’t be changed after it has been put into effect; it’s too late to alter the agreement.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Remember the royal proclamation God spoke over Abraham and to Abraham’s child? God said that his promises were made to pass on to Abraham’s “Child,” not children. And who is this “Child?” It’s the Son of promise, Christ himself!</verse>
				<verse number="17">This means that the covenant between God and Abraham was fulfilled in Messiah and cannot be altered. Yet the written law was not even given to Moses until 430 years after God had “signed” his contract with Abraham! The law, then, doesn’t supersede the promise since the royal proclamation was given before the law. If that were the case, it would have nullified what God said to Abraham. We receive all the promises because of the Promised One—not because we keep the law!</verse>
				<verse number="18"></verse>
				<verse number="19">Why then was the law given at all? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the “Seed,” the child who was promised. When God gave the law, he gave it first to angels; they gave it to Moses, his mediator, who then gave it to the people.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now, a mediator does not represent just one party alone, but God fulfilled it all by himself!</verse>
				<verse number="21">Since that’s true, should we consider the written law to be contrary to the promise of new life? How absurd! Truly, if there was a law that we could keep which would give us new life, then our salvation would have come by law-keeping.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But the Scriptures make it clear that the whole world is imprisoned by sin! This was so the promise would be given through faith to people who believe in Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So until the revelation of faith for salvation was released, the law was a jailer, holding us as prisoners under lock and key until the “faith,” which was destined to be revealed, would set us free.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The law was our guardian until Christ came so that we would be saved by faith.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But now that faith has come we are no longer under the guardian of the law.</verse>
				<verse number="26">You have all become true children of God by faith in Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="27">Faith immersed you into Christ, and now you are covered and clothed with his life.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And we no longer see each other in our former state —Jew or non-Jew, rich or poor, male or female—because we’re all one through our union with Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And if you belong to Christ, then you are now Abraham’s “child” and a true heir of all his blessings because of the promise God made to Abraham!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Let me illustrate: As long as an heir is a minor, he’s not really much different than a servant, although he’s the master over all of them.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For until the time appointed by the father, the child is under the domestic supervision of the guardians of the estate.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So it is with us. When we were juveniles we were enslaved under the hostile spirits of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But when the time of fulfillment had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yet all of this was so that he would redeem and set free those held hostage to the law so that we would receive our freedom and a full legal adoption as his children.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And so that we would know that we are his true children, God released the Spirit of Sonship into our hearts—moving us to cry out intimately, “My Father! My true Father!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now we’re no longer living like slaves under the law, but we enjoy being God’s very own sons and daughters! And because we’re his, we can access everything our Father has —for we are heirs because of what God has done!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Before we knew God as our Father, we were unwitting servants to the powers that be, which are nothing compared to God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But now that we truly know him and are intimately known by him, why would we for a moment consider turning back to those weak and feeble principles of religion, as though we were still subject to them?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Why would we want to scrupulously observe rituals like special days, celebrations of the new moon, annual festivals, and sacred years?</verse>
				<verse number="11">I’m so alarmed about you that I’m beginning to wonder if my labor in ministry among you was a waste of time!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Beloved ones, I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You are well aware that the reason I stayed among you to preach the good news was because of the poor state of my health.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And yet you were so kind to me and did not despise me in my weakness, even though my physical condition put you through an ordeal while I was with you. Actually, you received me and cared for me as though I were an angel from God, as you would have cared for Jesus Christ himself!</verse>
				<verse number="15">Some of you were even willing, if it were possible, to pluck out your own eyes to replace mine! Where is that kindhearted and free spirit now?</verse>
				<verse number="16">Have I really become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Can’t you see what these false teachers are doing? They want to win you over so you will side with them. They want you divided from me so you will follow only them. Would you call that integrity?</verse>
				<verse number="18">Isn’t it better to seek excellence and integrity always, and not just only when I’m with you?</verse>
				<verse number="19">You are my dear children, but I agonize in spiritual “labor pains” once again, until the Anointed One will be fully formed in your hearts!</verse>
				<verse number="20">How I wish I could be there in person and change my tone toward you, for I am truly dumbfounded over what you are doing!</verse>
				<verse number="21">Tell me, do you want to go back to living strictly by the law? Haven’t you ever listened to what the law really says? Have you forgotten that Abraham had two sons; one by the slave girl, and the other by the freewoman?</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23">Ishmael, the son of the slave girl, was born of the natural realm. But Isaac, the son of the freewoman, was born supernaturally by the Spirit —a child of the promise of God!</verse>
				<verse number="24">These two women and their sons express an allegory and become symbols of two covenants. The first covenant was born on Mount Sinai, birthing children into slavery—children born to Hagar.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For “Hagar” represents the law given at Mount Sinai in Arabia. The “Hagar” metaphor corresponds to the earthly Jerusalem of today who are currently in bondage.</verse>
				<verse number="26">In contrast, there is a heavenly Jerusalem above us, which is our true “mother.” She is the freewoman, birthing children into freedom!</verse>
				<verse number="27">For it is written: “Burst forth with gladness, rejoice, O barren woman with no children, break through with the shouts of joy and jubilee, for you are about to give birth! The one who was once considered desolate and barren now has more children than the one who has a husband!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Dear friends, just like Isaac, we’re now the true children who inherit the kingdom promises.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And just as the son of the natural world at that time harassed the son born of the power of the Holy Spirit, so it is today.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And what does the Scripture tell us to do? “Expel the slave mother with her son! The son of the slave woman will not be a true heir— for the true heir of the promises is the son of the freewoman.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">It’s now so obvious! We’re not the children of the slave woman; we’re the supernatural sons of the freewoman— sons of grace!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">At last we have freedom, for Christ has set us free! We must always cherish this truth and firmly refuse to go back into the bondage of our past.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I, Paul, tell you: If you think there is benefit in circumcision and Jewish regulations, then you’re acting as though Christ is not enough.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I say it again emphatically: If you let yourselves be circumcised you are obliged to fulfill every single one of the commandments and regulations of the law!</verse>
				<verse number="4">If you want to be made right with God by fulfilling the obligations of the law, you have cut off more than your flesh —you have cut yourselves off from Christ and have fallen away from the revelation of grace!</verse>
				<verse number="5">But we have the true hope that comes from being made right with God, and by the Spirit we wait eagerly for this hope.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When you’re joined to the Anointed One, circumcision and religious obligations can benefit you nothing. All that matters now is living in the faith that works and expresses itself through love.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Before you were led astray, you were so faithful. Who has deceived you so that you have turned from what is right?</verse>
				<verse number="8">The One who enfolded you into his grace is not behind this false teaching that you’ve embraced.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Don’t you know that when you allow even a little lie into your heart, it can permeate your entire belief system?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Deep in my heart I have confidence that the Lord, who lives in you, will bring you back around to the truth. And I’m convinced that those who trouble you, whoever they think they are, will bear the penalty!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Dear friends, why do you think the religious system persecutes me? Is it because I preach the message of being circumcised and keeping all the laws of Judaism? Not at all! Is there no longer any offense over the cross?</verse>
				<verse number="12">To tell you the truth, I am so disgusted with all your agitators. I wish they would go even further and cut off their legalistic influence from your lives!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Beloved ones, God has called us to live a life of freedom. But don’t view this wonderful freedom as an excuse to set up a base of operations in the natural realm. Constantly love each other and be committed to serve one another.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For all the law can be summarized in one grand statement: “Demonstrate love to your neighbor, even as you care for and love yourself.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">But if you continue to criticize and come against each other over minor issues, you’re acting like wild beasts trying to destroy one another!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Let me emphasize this: As you yield to the dynamic life and power of the Holy Spirit, you will abandon the cravings of your self-life.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When your self-life craves the things that offend the Holy Spirit you hinder him from living free within you! And the Holy Spirit’s intense cravings hinder your self-life from dominating you! So then, the two incompatible and conflicting forces within you are your self-life of the flesh and the new creation life of the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But when you yield to the life of the Spirit, you will no longer be living under the law, but soaring above it!</verse>
				<verse number="19">The behavior of the self-life is obvious: Sexual immorality, lustful thoughts, pornography,</verse>
				<verse number="20">chasing after things instead of God, manipulating others, hatred of those who get in your way, senseless arguments, resentment when others are favored, temper tantrums, angry quarrels, only thinking of yourself, being in love with your own opinions,</verse>
				<verse number="21">being envious of the blessings of others, murder, uncontrolled addictions, wild parties, and all other similar behavior. Haven’t I already warned you that those who use their “freedom” for these things will not inherit the kingdom realm of God!</verse>
				<verse number="22">But the fruit produced by the Holy Spirit within you is divine love in all its varied expressions: joy that overflows, peace that subdues, patience that endures, kindness in action, a life full of virtue, faith that prevails, gentleness of heart, and strength of spirit. Never set the law above these qualities, for they are meant to be limitless.</verse>
				<verse number="23"></verse>
				<verse number="24">Keep in mind that we who belong to Jesus Christ have already experienced crucifixion. For everything connected with our self-life was put to death on the cross and crucified with Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="25">If the Spirit is the source of our life, we must also allow the Spirit to direct every aspect of our lives.</verse>
				<verse number="26">So may we never be arrogant, or look down on another, for each of us is an original. We must forsake all jealousy that diminishes the value of others.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">My beloved friends, if you see a believer who is overtaken with a fault, the one who is in the Spirit should seek to restore him in the Spirit of gentleness. But keep watch over your own heart so that you won’t be tempted to exalt yourself over him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Love empowers us to fulfill the law of the Anointed One as we carry each other’s troubles.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If you think you are somebody too important to stoop down to help another (when really you are not), you are living in deception.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Let everyone be devoted to fulfill the work God has given them to do with excellence, and their joy will be in doing what’s right and being themselves, and not in being affirmed by others.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Every believer is ultimately responsible for his or her own conscience.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And those who are taught the Word must share all good things with their teacher.</verse>
				<verse number="7">God will never be mocked! For what you plant will always be the very thing you harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The harvest you reap reveals the seed that you planted. If you plant the corrupt seeds of self-life into this natural realm, you can expect a harvest of corruption. If you plant the good seeds of Spirit-life you will reap beautiful fruits that grow from the everlasting life of the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And don’t allow yourselves to be weary in planting good seeds, for the season of reaping the wonderful harvest you’ve planted is coming!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Take advantage of every opportunity to be a blessing to others, especially to our brothers and sisters in the family of faith!</verse>
				<verse number="11">I’ve written this letter to you with my own handwriting—see how large I have to make the letters?</verse>
				<verse number="12">All those who insist that you be circumcised are recruiting you so they can boast in their own achievement. They seek to avoid the persecution that comes with preaching the liberating message of the cross of Messiah!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Not even those who are circumcised keep every detail of the written law. Yet they push you to be circumcised so that they can boast that you have become like them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">May my only boast be found in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. In him I have been crucified to this natural realm; and the natural realm is dead to me and no longer dominates my life.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Whether a man is circumcised or uncircumcised is meaningless to me. What really matters is the transforming power of this new creation life.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And all those who live in agreement with this standard will have true peace and God’s delight, for they are the Israel of God.</verse>
				<verse number="17">From now on, let no one cause me to suffer further, for I am carrying the very scars of our Lord Jesus in my body.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Finally my beloved ones—may the wonderful grace of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, be flowing in your spirit. So shall it be! In Messiah’s love, Paul</verse>
			</chapter>
		</book>
		<book number="49">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">Dear friends, My name is Paul, and I was chosen by God to be an apostle of Jesus, the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I’m writing this letter to all the devoted believers who have been made holy by being one with Jesus, the Anointed One. May God himself, the heavenly Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, release grace over you and impart total well-being into your lives.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realm has already been lavished upon us as a love gift from our wonderful heavenly Father, the Father of our Lord Jesus—all because he sees us wrapped into Christ. This is why we celebrate him with all our hearts!</verse>
				<verse number="4">And in love he chose us before he laid the foundation of the universe! Because of his great love, he ordained us, so that we would be seen as holy in his eyes with an unstained innocence.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For it was always in his perfect plan to adopt us as his delightful children, through our union with Jesus, the Anointed One, so that his tremendous love that cascades over us would glorify his grace —for the same love he has for the Beloved, Jesus, he has for us. And this unfolding plan brings him great pleasure!</verse>
				<verse number="6"></verse>
				<verse number="7">Since we are now joined to Christ, we have been given the treasures of redemption by his blood—the total cancellation of our sins—all because of the cascading riches of his grace.</verse>
				<verse number="8">This superabundant grace is already powerfully working in us, releasing all forms of wisdom and practical understanding.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And through the revelation of the Anointed One, he unveiled his secret desires to us—the hidden mystery of his long-range plan, which he was delighted to implement from the very beginning of time.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And because of God’s unfailing purpose, this detailed plan will reign supreme through every period of time until the fulfillment of all the ages finally reaches its climax—when God makes all things new in all of heaven and earth through Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Through our union with Christ we too have been claimed by God as his own inheritance. Before we were even born, he gave us our destiny; that we would fulfill the plan of God who always accomplishes every purpose and plan in his heart.</verse>
				<verse number="12">God’s purpose was that we Jews, who were the first to long for the messianic hope, would be the first to believe in the Anointed One and bring great praise and glory to God!</verse>
				<verse number="13">And because of him, when you who are not Jews heard the revelation of truth, you believed in the wonderful news of salvation. Now we have been stamped with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He is given to us like an engagement ring, as the first installment of what’s coming! He is our hope-promise of a future inheritance which seals us until we have all of redemption’s promises and experience complete freedom—all for the supreme glory and honor of God!</verse>
				<verse number="15">Because of this, since I first heard about your strong faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and your tender love toward all his devoted ones,</verse>
				<verse number="16">my heart is always full and overflowing with thanks to God for you as I constantly remember you in my prayers.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I pray that the Father of glory, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, would impart to you the riches of the Spirit of wisdom and the Spirit of revelation to know him through your deepening intimacy with him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I pray that the light of God will illuminate the eyes of your imagination, flooding you with light, until you experience the full revelation of the hope of his calling —that is, the wealth of God’s glorious inheritances that he finds in us, his holy ones!</verse>
				<verse number="19">I pray that you will continually experience the immeasurable greatness of God’s power made available to you through faith. Then your lives will be an advertisement of this immense power as it works through you! This is the mighty power</verse>
				<verse number="20">that was released when God raised Christ from the dead and exalted him to the place of highest honor and supreme authority in the heavenly realm!</verse>
				<verse number="21">And now he is exalted as first above every ruler, authority, government, and realm of power in existence! He is gloriously enthroned over every name that is ever praised, not only in this age, but in the age that is coming!</verse>
				<verse number="22">And he alone is the leader and source of everything needed in the church. God has put everything beneath the authority of Jesus Christ and has given him the highest rank above all others.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And now we, his church, are his body on the earth and that which fills him who is being filled by it!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">And his fullness fills you, even though you were once like corpses, dead in your sins and offenses.</verse>
				<verse number="2">It wasn’t that long ago that you lived in the religion, customs, and values of this world, obeying the dark ruler of the earthly realm who fills the atmosphere with his authority, and works diligently in the hearts of those who are disobedient to the truth of God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The corruption that was in us from birth was expressed through the deeds and desires of our self-life. We lived by whatever natural cravings and thoughts our minds dictated, living as rebellious children subject to God’s wrath like everyone else.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But God still loved us with such great love. He is so rich in compassion and mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Even when we were dead and doomed in our many sins, he united us into the very life of Christ and saved us by his wonderful grace!</verse>
				<verse number="6">He raised us up with Christ the exalted One, and we ascended with him into the glorious perfection and authority of the heavenly realm, for we are now co-seated as one with Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Throughout the coming ages we will be the visible display of the infinite riches of his grace and kindness, which was showered upon us in Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For by grace you have been saved by faith. Nothing you did could ever earn this salvation, for it was the love gift from God that brought us to Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="9">So no one will ever be able to boast, for salvation is never a reward for good works or human striving.</verse>
				<verse number="10">We have become his poetry, a re-created people that will fulfill the destiny he has given each of us, for we are joined to Jesus, the Anointed One. Even before we were born, God planned in advance our destiny and the good works we would do to fulfill it!</verse>
				<verse number="11">So don’t forget that you were not born as Jews and were uncircumcised (circumcision itself is just a work of man’s hands); you had none of the Jewish covenants and laws; you were foreigners to Israel’s incredible heritage; you were without the covenants and prophetic promises of the Messiah, the promised hope, and without God.</verse>
				<verse number="12"></verse>
				<verse number="13">Yet look at you now! Everything is new! Although you were once distant and far away from God, now you have been brought delightfully close to him through the sacred blood of Jesus—you have actually been united to Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Our reconciling “Peace” is Jesus! He has made Jew and non-Jew one in Christ. By dying as our sacrifice, he has broken down every wall of prejudice that separated us and has now made us equal through our union with Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Ethnic hatred has been dissolved by the crucifixion of his precious body on the cross. The legal code that stood condemning every one of us has now been repealed by his command. His triune essence has made peace between us by starting over—forming one new race of humanity, Jews and non-Jews fused together in himself!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Two have now become one, and we live restored to God and reconciled in the body of Christ. Through his crucifixion, hatred died.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the Messiah has come to preach this sweet message of peace to you, the ones who were distant, and to those who are near.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And now, because we are united to Christ, we both have equal and direct access in the realm of the Holy Spirit to come before the Father!</verse>
				<verse number="19">So, you are not foreigners or guests, but rather you are the children of the city of the holy ones, with all the rights as family members of the household of God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You are rising like the perfectly fitted stones of the temple; and your lives have been built up together upon the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, and best of all, you are connected to the Head Cornerstone of the building, the Anointed One, Jesus Christ himself!</verse>
				<verse number="21">This entire building is under construction and is continually growing under his supervision until it rises up completed as the holy temple of the Lord himself.</verse>
				<verse number="22">This means that God is transforming each one of you into the Holy of Holies, his dwelling place, through the power of the Holy Spirit living in you!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Beloved friends, because of my love for Jesus Christ, I am now his prisoner for the sake of all of you who are not Jews,</verse>
				<verse number="2">so that you will hear the gospel that God has entrusted to me to share with you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For this wonderful mystery, which I briefly described, was given to me by divine revelation,</verse>
				<verse number="4">so that whenever you read it you will be able to understand my revelation and insight into the secret mystery of the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="5">There has never been a generation that has been given the detailed understanding of this glorious and divine mystery until now. He kept it a secret until this generation. God is revealing it only now to his sacred apostles and prophets by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Here’s the secret: The gospel of grace has made you, non-Jewish believers, into coheirs of his promise through your union with him. And you have now become members of his body—one with the Anointed One!</verse>
				<verse number="7">I have been made a messenger of this wonderful news by the gift of grace that works through me. Even though I am the least significant of all his holy believers, this grace-gift was imparted when the manifestation of his power came upon me. Grace alone empowers me so that I can boldly preach this wonderful message to non-Jewish people, sharing with them the unfading, inexhaustible riches of Christ, which are beyond comprehension.</verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">My passion is to enlighten every person to this divine mystery. It was hidden for ages past until now, and kept a secret in the heart of God, the Creator of all.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The purpose of this was to unveil before every throne and rank of angelic orders in the heavenly realm God’s full and diverse wisdom revealed through the church.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This perfectly wise plan was destined from eternal ages and fulfilled completely in our Lord Jesus Christ, so that now</verse>
				<verse number="12">we have boldness through him, and free access as kings before the Father because of our complete confidence in Christ’s faithfulness.</verse>
				<verse number="13">My dear friends, I pray that you will remain strong and not be discouraged or ashamed by all that I suffer on your behalf, for it is for your glory.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So I kneel humbly in awe before the Father of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah,</verse>
				<verse number="15">the perfect Father of every father and child in heaven and on the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And I pray that he would unveil within you the unlimited riches of his glory and favor until supernatural strength floods your innermost being with his divine might and explosive power.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then, by constantly using your faith, the life of Christ will be released deep inside you, and the resting place of his love will become the very source and root of your life.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then you will be empowered to discover what every holy one experiences—the great magnitude of the astonishing love of Christ in all its dimensions. How deeply intimate and far-reaching is his love! How enduring and inclusive it is! Endless love beyond measurement that transcends our understanding—this extravagant love pours into you until you are filled to overflowing with the fullness of God!</verse>
				<verse number="19"></verse>
				<verse number="20">Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Now we offer up to God all the glorious praise that rises from every church in every generation through Jesus Christ—and all that will yet be manifest through time and eternity. Amen!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">As a prisoner of the Lord, I plead with you to walk holy, in a way that is suitable to your high rank, given to you in your divine calling.</verse>
				<verse number="2">With tender humility and quiet patience, always demonstrate gentleness and generous love toward one another, especially toward those who may try your patience.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Be faithful to guard the sweet harmony of the Holy Spirit among you in the bonds of peace,</verse>
				<verse number="4">being one body and one spirit, as you were all called into the same glorious hope of divine destiny.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For the Lord God is one, and so are we, for we share in one faith, one baptism, and one Father.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And he is the perfect Father who leads us all, works through us all, and lives in us all!</verse>
				<verse number="7">And he has generously given each one of us supernatural grace, according to the size of the gift of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="8">This is why he says: “He ascends into the heavenly heights taking his many captured ones with him, and gifts were given to men.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">He “ascended” means that he returned to heaven, after he had first descended from the heights of heaven, even to the lower regions, namely, the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The same one who descended is also the one who ascended above the heights of heaven, in order to begin the restoration and fulfillment of all things.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And he has appointed some with grace to be apostles, and some with grace to be prophets, and some with grace to be evangelists, and some with grace to be pastors, and some with grace to be teachers.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And their calling is to nurture and prepare all the holy believers to do their own works of ministry, and as they do this they will enlarge and build up the body of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="13">These grace ministries will function until we all attain oneness into the faith, until we all experience the fullness of what it means to know the Son of God, and finally we become one into a perfect man with the full dimensions of spiritual maturity and fully developed into the abundance of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And then our immaturity will end! And we will not be easily shaken by trouble, nor led astray by novel teachings or by the false doctrines of deceivers who teach clever lies.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But instead we will remain strong and always sincere in our love as we express the truth. All our direction and ministries will flow from Christ and lead us deeper into him, the anointed Head of his body, the church.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For his “body” has been formed in his image and is closely joined together and constantly connected as one. And every member has been given divine gifts to contribute to the growth of all; and as these gifts operate effectively throughout the whole body, we are built up and made perfect in love.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So with the wisdom given to me from the Lord I say: You should not live like the unbelievers around you who walk in their empty delusions.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Their corrupted logic has been clouded because their hearts are so far from God—their blinded understanding and deep-seated moral darkness keeps them from the true knowledge of God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Because of spiritual apathy, they surrender their lives to lewdness, impurity, and sexual obsession.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But this is not the way of life that Christ has unfolded within you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">If you have really experienced the Anointed One, and heard his truth, it will be seen in your life; for we know that the ultimate reality is embodied in Jesus!</verse>
				<verse number="22">And he has taught you to let go of the lifestyle of the ancient man, the old self-life, which was corrupted by sinful and deceitful desires that spring from delusions.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now it’s time to be made new by every revelation that’s been given to you.</verse>
				<verse number="24">And to be transformed as you embrace the glorious Christ-within as your new life and live in union with him! For God has re-created you all over again in his perfect righteousness, and you now belong to him in the realm of true holiness.</verse>
				<verse number="25">So discard every form of dishonesty and lying so that you will be known as one who always speaks the truth, for we all belong to one another.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But don’t let the passion of your emotions lead you to sin! Don’t let anger control you or be fuel for revenge, not for even a day.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Don’t give the slanderous accuser, the Devil, an opportunity to manipulate you!</verse>
				<verse number="28">If any one of you has stolen from someone else, never do it again. Instead, be industrious, earning an honest living, and then you’ll have enough to bless those in need.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And never let ugly or hateful words come from your mouth, but instead let your words become beautiful gifts that encourage others; do this by speaking words of grace to help them.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The Holy Spirit of God has sealed you in Jesus Christ until you experience your full salvation. So never grieve the Spirit of God or take for granted his holy influence in your life.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Lay aside bitter words, temper tantrums, revenge, profanity, and insults.</verse>
				<verse number="32">But instead be kind and affectionate toward one another. Has God graciously forgiven you? Then graciously forgive one another in the depths of Christ’s love.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Be imitators of God in everything you do, for then you will represent your Father as his beloved sons and daughters.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And continue to walk surrendered to the extravagant love of Christ, for he surrendered his life as a sacrifice for us. His great love for us was pleasing to God, like an aroma of adoration—a sweet healing fragrance.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And have nothing to do with sexual immorality, lust, or greed—for you are his holy ones and let no one be able to accuse you of them in any form.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Guard your speech. Forsake obscenities and worthless insults; these are nonsensical words that bring disgrace and are unnecessary. Instead, let worship fill your heart and spill out in your words.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For it has been made clear to you already that the kingdom of God cannot be accessed by anyone who is guilty of sexual sin, or who is impure or greedy—for greed is the essence of idolatry. How could they expect to have an inheritance in Christ’s kingdom while doing those things?</verse>
				<verse number="6">Don’t be fooled by those who speak their empty words and deceptive teachings telling you otherwise. This is what brings God’s anger upon the rebellious!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Don’t listen to them or live like them at all.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Once your life was full of sin’s darkness, but now you have the very light of our Lord shining through you because of your union with him. Your mission is to live as children flooded with his revelation-light!</verse>
				<verse number="9">And the supernatural fruits of his light will be seen in you—goodness, righteousness, and truth.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then you will learn to choose what is beautiful to our Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And don’t even associate with the servants of darkness because they have no fruit in them; instead, reveal truth to them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The very things they do in secret are too vile and filthy to even mention.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Whatever the revelation-light exposes, it will also correct, and everything that reveals truth is light to the soul.</verse>
				<verse number="14">This is why the Scripture says, “Arise, you sleeper! Rise up from your coffin and the Anointed One will shine his light into you!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So be very careful how you live, not being like those with no understanding, but live honorably with true wisdom, for we are living in evil times. Take full advantage of every day as you spend your life for his purposes.</verse>
				<verse number="16"></verse>
				<verse number="17">And don’t live foolishly for then you will have discernment to fully understand God’s will.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And don’t get drunk with wine, which is rebellion; instead be filled continually with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And your hearts will overflow with a joyful song to the Lord. Keep speaking to each other with words of Scripture, singing the Psalms with praises and spontaneous songs given by the Spirit!</verse>
				<verse number="20">Always give thanks to Father God for every person he brings into your life in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And out of your reverence for Christ be supportive of each other in love.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For wives, this means being devoted to your husbands like you are tenderly devoted to our Lord,</verse>
				<verse number="23">for the husband provides leadership for the wife, just as Christ provides leadership for his church, as the Savior and Reviver of the body.</verse>
				<verse number="24">In the same way the church is devoted to Christ, let the wives be devoted to their husbands in everything.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And to the husbands, you are to demonstrate love for your wives with the same tender devotion that Christ demonstrated to us, his bride. For he died for us, sacrificing himself</verse>
				<verse number="26">to make us holy and pure, cleansing us through the showering of the pure water of the Word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="27">All that he does in us is designed to make us a mature church for his pleasure, until we become a source of praise to him—glorious and radiant, beautiful and holy, without fault or flaw.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Husbands have the obligation of loving and caring for their wives the same way they love and care for their own bodies, for to love your wife is to love your own self.</verse>
				<verse number="29">No one abuses his own body, but pampers it—serving and satisfying its needs. That’s exactly what Christ does for his church!</verse>
				<verse number="30">He serves and satisfies us as members of his body.</verse>
				<verse number="31">For this reason a man is to leave his father and his mother and lovingly hold to his wife, since the two have become joined as one flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Marriage is the beautiful design of the Almighty, a great mystery of Christ and his church.</verse>
				<verse number="33">So every married man should be gracious to his wife just as he is gracious to himself. And every wife should be tenderly devoted to her husband.</verse>

				<verse number="1">Children, if you want to be wise, listen to your parents and do what they tell you, and the Lord will help you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For the commandment, “Honor your father and your mother,” was the first of the Ten Commandments with a promise attached:</verse>
				<verse number="3">“You will prosper and live a long, full life if you honor your parents.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Fathers, don’t exasperate your children, but raise them up with loving discipline and counsel that brings the revelation of our Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Those who are employed should listen to their employers and obey their instructions with great respect and honor. Serve them with humility in your hearts as though you were working for the Master.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Always do what is right and not only when others are watching, so that you may please Christ as his servants by doing his will.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Serve your employers wholeheartedly and with love, as though you were serving Christ and not men.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Be assured that anything you do that is beautiful and excellent will be repaid by our Lord, whether you are an employee or an employer.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And to the caretakers of the flock I say, do what is right with your people by forgiving them when they offend you, for you know there is a Master in heaven that shows no favoritism.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now my beloved ones, I have saved these most important truths for last: Be supernaturally infused with strength through your life-union with the Lord Jesus. Stand victorious with the force of his explosive power flowing in and through you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Put on God’s complete set of armor provided for us, so that you will be protected as you fight against the evil strategies of the accuser!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Your hand-to-hand combat is not with human beings, but with the highest principalities and authorities operating in rebellion under the heavenly realms. For they are a powerful class of demon-gods and evil spirits that hold this dark world in bondage.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Because of this, you must wear all the armor that God provides so you’re protected as you confront the slanderer, for you are destined for all things and will rise victorious.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Put on truth as a belt to strengthen you to stand in triumph. Put on holiness as the protective armor that covers your heart.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Stand on your feet alert, then you’ll always be ready to share the blessings of peace.</verse>
				<verse number="16">In every battle, take faith as your wrap-around shield, for it is able to extinguish the blazing arrows coming at you from the evil one!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Embrace the power of salvation’s full deliverance, like a helmet to protect your thoughts from lies. And take the mighty razor-sharp Spirit-sword of the spoken word of God. Pray passionately in the Spirit, as you constantly intercede with every form of prayer at all times. Pray the blessings of God upon all his believers.</verse>
				<verse number="18"></verse>
				<verse number="19">And pray also that God’s revelation would be released through me every time I preach the wonderful mystery of the hope-filled gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yes, pray that I may preach the wonderful news of God’s kingdom with bold freedom at every opportunity. Even though I am chained as a prisoner, I am his ambassador.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I am sending you a dear friend, Tychicus. He is a beloved brother and trustworthy minister in our Lord Jesus. He will share with you all the concerns that I have for your welfare and will inform you of how I am getting along. And he will also prophesy over you to encourage your hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23">So may God shower his peace upon you, my beloved friends. And may the blessings of faith and love fill your hearts from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus, the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Abundant grace will be with you all as each of you love our Lord Jesus Christ without corruption. Amen! Love in Christ, Paul</verse>

		<book number="50">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul and Timothy, both of us servants of Jesus, the Anointed One. To all his devoted followers in Philippi, including your pastors, and to all the servant-leaders of the church.</verse>
				<verse number="2">May the blessings of divine grace and supernatural peace that flow from God our wonderful Father, and our Messiah, the Lord Jesus, be upon your lives.</verse>
				<verse number="3">My prayers for you are full of praise to God as I give him thanks for you with great joy! I’m so grateful for our union</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">and our enduring partnership that began the first time I presented to you the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I pray with great faith for you, because I’m fully convinced that the One who began this gracious work in you will faithfully continue the process of maturing you until the unveiling of our Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="7">It’s no wonder I pray with such confidence, since you have a permanent place in my heart! You have remained partners with me in the wonderful grace of God even though I’m here in chains for standing up for the truth of the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Only God knows how much I dearly love you with the tender affection of Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I continue to pray for your love to grow and increase beyond measure, bringing you into the rich revelation of spiritual insight in all things.</verse>
				<verse number="10">This will enable you to choose the most excellent way of all —becoming pure and without offense until the unveiling of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And you will be filled completely with the fruits of righteousness that are found in Jesus, the Anointed One—bringing great praise and glory to God!</verse>
				<verse number="12">I want you to know, dear ones, what has happened to me has not hindered, but helped my ministry of preaching the gospel, causing it to expand and spread to many people.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For now the elite Roman guards and government officials overseeing my imprisonment have plainly recognized that I am here because of my love for the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And what I’m going through has actually caused many believers to become even more courageous in the Lord and to be bold and passionate to preach the Word of God, all because of my chains.</verse>
				<verse number="15">It’s true that there are some who preach Christ out of competition and controversy, for they are jealous over the way God has used me. Many others have purer motives —they preach with grace and love filling their hearts,</verse>
				<verse number="16">because they know I’ve been destined for the purpose of defending the revelation of God.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Those who preach Christ with ambition and competition are insincere—they just want to add to the hardships of my imprisonment.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Yet in spite of all of this I am overjoyed! For what does it matter as long as Christ is being preached? If they preach him with mixed motives or with genuine love, the message of Christ is still being preached. And I will continue to rejoice</verse>
				<verse number="19">because I know that the lavish supply of the Spirit of Jesus, the Anointed One, and your intercession for me will bring about my deliverance.</verse>
				<verse number="20">No matter what, I will continue to hope and passionately cling to Christ, so that he will be openly revealed through me before everyone’s eyes. So I will not be ashamed! In my life or in my death, Christ will be magnified in me.</verse>
				<verse number="21">My true life is the Anointed One, and dying means gaining more of him.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So here’s my dilemma: Each day I live means bearing more fruit in my ministry; yet I fervently long to be liberated from this body and joined fully to Christ. That would suit me fine, but the greatest advantage to you would be that I remain alive. So you can see why I’m torn between the two—I don’t know which I prefer.</verse>
				<verse number="23"></verse>
				<verse number="24"></verse>
				<verse number="25">Yet deep in my heart I’m confident that I will be spared so I can add to your joy and further strengthen and mature your faith.</verse>
				<verse number="26">When I am freed to come to you, my deliverance will give you a reason to boast even more in Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Whatever happens, keep living your lives based on the reality of the gospel of Christ. Then when I come to see you, or hear good reports of you, I’ll know that you stand united in one Spirit and one passion—celebrating together as conquerors in the faith of the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And then you will never be shaken or intimidated by the opposition that rises up against us. Your courage will prove to be a sure sign from God of their coming destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For God has graciously given you the privilege not only to believe in Christ, but also to suffer for him.</verse>
				<verse number="30">For you have been called by him to endure the conflict in the same way I have endured it—for you know I’m not giving up.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Look at how much encouragement you’ve found in your relationship with the Anointed One! You are filled to overflowing with his comforting love. You have experienced a deepening friendship with the Holy Spirit and have felt his tender affection and mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So I’m asking you, my friends, that you be joined together in perfect unity—with one heart, one passion, and united in one love. Walk together with one harmonious purpose and you will fill my heart with unbounded joy.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Be free from pride-filled opinions, for they will only harm your cherished unity. Don’t allow self-promotion to hide in your hearts, but in authentic humility put others first and view others as more important than yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Abandon every display of selfishness. Possess a greater concern for what matters to others instead of your own interests.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And consider the example that Jesus, the Anointed One, has set before us. Let his mindset become your motivation.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He existed in the form of God, yet he gave no thought to seizing equality with God as his supreme prize.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Instead he emptied himself of his outward glory by reducing himself to the form of a lowly servant. He became human!</verse>
				<verse number="8">He humbled himself and became vulnerable, choosing to be revealed as a man and was obedient. He was a perfect example, even in his death—a criminal’s death by crucifixion!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Because of that obedience, God exalted him and multiplied his greatness! He has now been given the greatest of all names!</verse>
				<verse number="10">The authority of the name of Jesus causes every knee to bow in reverence! Everything and everyone will one day submit to this name—in the heavenly realm, in the earthly realm, and in the demonic realm.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And every tongue will proclaim in every language: “Jesus Christ is Lord Yahweh,” bringing glory and honor to God, his Father!</verse>
				<verse number="12">My beloved ones, just like you’ve always listened to everything I’ve taught you in the past, I’m asking you now to keep following my instructions as though I were right there with you. Now you must continue to make this new life fully manifested as you live in the holy awe of God—which brings you trembling into his presence.</verse>
				<verse number="13">God will continually revitalize you, implanting within you the passion to do what pleases him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Live a cheerful life, without complaining or division among yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For then you will be seen as innocent, faultless, and pure children of God, even though you live in the midst of a brutal and perverse culture. For you will appear among them as shining lights in the universe,</verse>
				<verse number="16">holding out the words of eternal life. I haven’t labored among you for nothing, for your lives are the fruit of my ministry and will be my glorious boast at the unveiling of Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="17">But I will rejoice even if my life is poured out like a liquid offering to God over your sacrificial and surrendered lives of faith.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And so no matter what happens to me, you should rejoice in ecstatic celebration with me!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yet I’m trusting in our Lord Jesus that I may send Timothy to you soon, so I can be refreshed when I find out how you’re doing.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Timothy is like no other. He carries the same passion for your welfare that I carry in my heart.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For it seems as though everyone else is busy seeking what is best for themselves instead of the things that are most important to our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="22">You already know about his excellent reputation, since he has served alongside me as a loyal son in the work of ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="23">After I see what transpires with me he’s the one I will send to you to bless you.</verse>
				<verse number="24">And I’m trusting in my Lord to return to you in due time.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But for now, I feel a stirring in my heart to send Epaphroditus back to you immediately. He’s a friend to me and a wonderful brother and fellow soldier who has worked with me as we serve as ministers of the gospel. And you sent him as your apostle to minister to me in my need.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But now he is grieved to know that you found out he had been sick, so he longs to return and comfort you in this.</verse>
				<verse number="27">It’s true he almost died, but God showed him mercy and healed him. And I’m so thankful to God for his healing, as I was spared from having the sorrow of losing him on top of all my other troubles!</verse>
				<verse number="28">So you can see why I’m delighted to send him to you now. I know that you’re anxious to see him and rejoice in his healing, and it encourages me to know how happy you’ll be to have him back.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So warmly welcome him home in the Lord, with joyous love, and esteem him highly, for people like him deserve it.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Because of me, he put his life on the line, despising the danger, so that he could provide for me with what you couldn’t, since you were so far away. And he did it all because of his ministry for Christ.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">My beloved ones, don’t ever limit your joy or fail to rejoice in the wonderful experience of knowing our Lord Jesus! I don’t mind repeating what I’ve already written you because it protects you—</verse>
				<verse number="2">beware of those religious hypocrites who teach that you should be circumcised to please God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For we have already experienced “heart-circumcision,” and we worship God in the power and freedom of the Holy Spirit, not in laws and religious duties. We are those who boast in what Jesus Christ has done, and not in what we can accomplish in our own strength.</verse>
				<verse number="4">It’s true that I once relied on all that I had become. I had a reason to boast and impress people with my accomplishments—more than others—for my pedigree was impeccable.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I was born a true Hebrew of the heritage of Israel as the son of a Jewish man from the tribe of Benjamin. I was circumcised eight days after my birth and was raised in the strict tradition of Orthodox Judaism, living a separated and devout life as a Pharisee.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And concerning the righteousness of the Torah, no one surpassed me; I was without a peer. Furthermore, as a fiery defender of the truth, I persecuted the messianic believers with religious zeal.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yet all of the accomplishments that I once took credit for, I’ve now forsaken them and I regard it all as nothing compared to the delight of experiencing Jesus Christ as my Lord!</verse>
				<verse number="8">To truly know him meant letting go of everything from my past and throwing all my boasting on the garbage heap. It’s all like a pile of manure to me now, so that I may be enriched in the reality of knowing Jesus Christ and embrace him as Lord in all of his greatness.</verse>
				<verse number="9">My passion is to be consumed with him and not cling to my own “righteousness” based in keeping the written Law. My only “righteousness” will be his, based on the faithfulness of Jesus Christ—the very righteousness that comes from God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And I continually long to know the wonders of Jesus and to experience the overflowing power of his resurrection working in me. I will be one with him in his sufferings and become like him in his death.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Only then will I be able to experience complete oneness with him in his resurrection from the realm of death.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I admit that I haven’t yet acquired the absolute fullness that I’m pursuing, but I run with passion into his abundance so that I may reach the purpose for which Christ Jesus laid hold of me to make me his own.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I don’t depend on my own strength to accomplish this; however I do have one compelling focus: I forget all of the past as I fasten my heart to the future instead.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I run straight for the divine invitation of reaching the heavenly goal and gaining the victory-prize through the anointing of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So let all who are fully mature have this same passion, and if anyone is not yet gripped by these desires, God will reveal it to them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And let us all advance together to reach this victory-prize, following one path with one passion.</verse>
				<verse number="17">My beloved friends, imitate my walk with God and follow all those who walk according to the way of life we modeled before you.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For there are many who live by different standards. As I’ve warned you many times (I weep as I write these words), they are enemies of the cross of the Anointed One and</verse>
				<verse number="19">doom awaits them. Their god has possessed them and made them mute. Their boast is in their shameful lifestyles and their minds are in the dirt.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But we are a colony of heaven on earth as we cling tightly to our life-giver, the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="21">who will transform our humble bodies and transfigure us into the identical likeness of his glorified body. And using his matchless power, he continually subdues everything to himself.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">My dear and precious friends, whom I deeply love, you have truly become my glorious joy and crown of reward. Now arise in the fullness of your union with our Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And I plead with Euodia and Syntyche to settle their disagreement and be restored with one mind in our Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I would like my dear friend and burden-bearer to help resolve this issue, for both women have diligently labored with me for the prize and helped in spreading the revelation of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers. All of their names are written in the Book of Life.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Be cheerful with joyous celebration in every season of life. Let your joy overflow!</verse>
				<verse number="5">And let gentleness be seen in every relationship, for our Lord is ever near.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Don’t be pulled in different directions or worried about a thing. Be saturated in prayer throughout each day, offering your faith-filled requests before God with overflowing gratitude. Tell him every detail of your life,</verse>
				<verse number="7">then God’s wonderful peace that transcends human understanding, will guard your heart and mind through Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Keep your thoughts continually fixed on all that is authentic and real, honorable and admirable, beautiful and respectful, pure and holy, merciful and kind. And fasten your thoughts on every glorious work of God, praising him always.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Put into practice the example of all that you have heard from me or seen in my life and the God of peace will be with you in all things.</verse>
				<verse number="10">My heart overflows with joy when I think of how you demonstrated love to me by your financial support of my ministry. For even though you have so little, you still continue to help me at every opportunity.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I’m not telling you this because I’m in need, for I have learned to be satisfied in any circumstance.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I know what it means to lack, and I know what it means to experience overwhelming abundance. For I’m trained in the secret of overcoming all things, whether in fullness or in hunger. And I find that the strength of Christ’s explosive power infuses me to conquer every difficulty.</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">You’ve so graciously provided for my essential needs during this season of difficulty.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For I want you to know that the Philippian church was the only church that supported me in the beginning as I went out to preach the gospel. You were the only church that sowed into me financially,</verse>
				<verse number="16">and when I was in Thessalonica, you supported me for well over a year.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I mention this not because I’m requesting a gift, but so that the fruit of your generosity may bring you an abundant reward.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I now have all I need—more than enough—I’m abundantly satisfied! For I’ve received the gift you sent by Epaphroditus and viewed it as a sweet sacrifice, perfumed with the fragrance of your faithfulness, which is so pleasing to God!</verse>
				<verse number="19">I am convinced that my God will fully satisfy every need you have, for I have seen the abundant riches of glory revealed to me through Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="20">And God our Father will receive all the glory and the honor throughout the eternity of eternities! Amen!</verse>
				<verse number="21">Give my warm greetings to all the believers in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="22">All the brothers and sisters that are here with me send their loving greetings, especially the converts from Caesar’s household.</verse>
				<verse number="23">May the grace and favor of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit!</verse>

My colleague, Timothy, and I send this letter to all the holy believers who have been united to Jesus as beloved followers of the Messiah. May God, our true Father, release upon your lives the riches of his kind favor and heavenly peace through the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">Every time we pray for you our hearts overflow with thanksgiving to Father God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>

				<verse number="5">Your faith and love rise within you as you access all the treasures of your inheritance stored up in the heavenly realm. For the revelation of the true gospel is as real today as the day you first heard of our glorious hope, now that you have believed in the truth of the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="6">This is the wonderful message that is being spread everywhere, powerfully changing hearts throughout the earth, just like it has changed you! Every believer of this good news bears the fruit of eternal life as they experience the reality of God’s grace.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Our beloved coworker, Epaphras, was there from the beginning to thoroughly teach you the astonishing revelation of the gospel, and he serves you faithfully as Christ’s representative.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He’s informed us of the many wonderful ways love is being demonstrated through your lives by the empowerment of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Since we first heard about you, we’ve kept you always in our prayers that you would receive the perfect knowledge of God’s pleasure over your lives, making you reservoirs of every kind of wisdom and spiritual understanding.</verse>
				<verse number="10">We pray that you would walk in the ways of true righteousness, pleasing God in every good thing you do. Then you’ll become fruit-bearing branches, yielding to his life, and maturing in the rich experience of knowing God in his fullness!</verse>
				<verse number="11">And we pray that you would be energized with all his explosive power from the realm of his magnificent glory, filling you with great hope.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Your hearts can soar with joyful gratitude when you think of how God made you worthy to receive the glorious inheritance freely given to us by living in the light.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He has rescued us completely from the tyrannical rule of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom realm of his beloved Son.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For in the Son all our sins are canceled and we have the release of redemption through his very blood.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He is the divine portrait, the true likeness of the invisible God, and the firstborn heir of all creation.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For in him was created the universe of things, both in the heavenly realm and on the earth, all that is seen and all that is unseen. Every seat of power, realm of government, principality, and authority—it all exists through him and for his purpose!</verse>
				<verse number="17">He existed before anything was made, and now everything finds completion in him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He is the Head of his body, which is the church. And since he is the beginning and the firstborn heir in resurrection, he is the most exalted One, holding first place in everything.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For God is satisfied to have all his fullness dwelling in Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And by the blood of his cross, everything in heaven and earth is brought back to himself— back to its original intent, restored to innocence again!</verse>
				<verse number="21">Even though you were once distant from him, living in the shadows of your evil thoughts and actions, he reconnected you back to himself. He released his supernatural peace to you through the sacrifice of his own body as the sin-payment on your behalf so that you would dwell in his presence. And now there is nothing between you and Father God, for he sees you as holy, flawless, and restored,</verse>
				<verse number="22"></verse>
				<verse number="23">if indeed you continue to advance in faith, assured of a firm foundation to grow upon. Never be shaken from the hope of the gospel you have believed in. And this is the glorious news I preach all over the world.</verse>
				<verse number="24">I can even celebrate the sorrows I have experienced on your behalf; for as I join with you in your difficulties, it helps you to discover what lacks in your understanding of the sufferings Jesus Christ experienced for his body, the church.</verse>
				<verse number="25">This is the very reason I’ve been made a minister by the authority of God and a servant to his body, so that in his detailed plan I would fully equip you with the Word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="26">There is a divine mystery—a secret surprise that has been concealed from the world for generations, but now it’s being revealed, unfolded and manifested for every holy believer to experience.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Living within you is the Christ who floods you with the expectation of glory! This mystery of Christ, embedded within us, becomes a heavenly treasure chest of hope filled with the riches of glory for his people, and God wants everyone to know it!</verse>
				<verse number="28">Christ is our message! We preach to awaken hearts and bring every person into the full understanding of truth. It has become my inspiration and passion in ministry to labor with a tireless intensity, with his power flowing through me, to present to every believer the revelation of being his perfect one in Jesus Christ.</verse>

				<verse number="5">Even though I’m separated from you geographically, my spirit is present there with you. And I’m overjoyed to see how disciplined and deeply committed you are because you have such a solid faith in Christ, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="6">In the same way you received Jesus our Lord and Messiah by faith, continue your journey of faith, progressing further into your union with him!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Your spiritual roots go deeply into his life as you are continually infused with strength, encouraged in every way. For you are established in the faith you have absorbed and enriched by your devotion to him!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Beware that no one distracts you or intimidates you in their attempt to lead you away from Christ’s fullness by pretending to be full of wisdom when they’re filled with endless arguments of human logic. For they operate with humanistic and clouded judgments based on the mindset of this world system, and not the anointed truths of the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For he is the complete fullness of deity living in human form.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And our own completeness is now found in him. We are completely filled with God as Christ’s fullness overflows within us. He is the Head of every kingdom and authority in the universe!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Through our union with him we have experienced circumcision of heart. All of the guilt and power of sin has been cut away and is now extinct because of what Christ, the Anointed One, has accomplished for us.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For we’ve been buried with him into his death. Our “baptism into death” also means we were raised with him when we believed in God’s resurrection power, the power that raised him from death’s realm.</verse>
				<verse number="13">This “realm of death” describes our former state, for we were held in sin’s grasp. But now, we’ve been resurrected out of that “realm of death” never to return, for we are forever alive and forgiven of all our sins!</verse>
				<verse number="14">He canceled out every legal violation we had on our record and the old arrest warrant that stood to indict us. He erased it all—our sins, our stained soul—he deleted it all and they cannot be retrieved! Everything we once were in Adam has been placed onto his cross and nailed permanently there as a public display of cancellation.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then Jesus made a public spectacle of all the powers and principalities of darkness, stripping away from them every weapon and all their spiritual authority and power to accuse us. And by the power of the cross, Jesus led them around as prisoners in a procession of triumph. He was not their prisoner; they were his!</verse>
				<verse number="16">So why would you allow anyone to judge you because of what you eat or drink, or insist that you keep the feasts, observe new moon celebrations, or the Sabbath?</verse>
				<verse number="17">All of these were but a prophetic shadow and the evidence of what would be fulfilled, for the body is now Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Don’t let anyone disqualify you from your prize! Don’t let their pretended sincerity fool you as they deliberately lead you into their initiation of angel worship. For they take pleasure in pretending to be experts of something they know nothing about. Their reasoning is meaningless and comes only from their own opinions.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They refuse to take hold of the true source. But we receive directly from him, and his life supplies vitality into every part of his body through the joining ligaments connecting us all as one. He is the divine Head who guides his body and causes it to grow by the supernatural power of God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For you were included in the death of Christ and have died with him to the religious system and powers of this world. Don’t retreat back to being bullied by the standards and opinions of religion—</verse>
				<verse number="21">for example, their strict requirements, “You can’t associate with that person!” or, “Don’t eat that!” or, “You can’t touch that!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">These are the doctrines of men and corrupt customs that are worthless to help you spiritually.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For though they may appear to possess the promise of wisdom in their submission to God through the deprivation of their physical bodies, it is actually nothing more than empty rules rooted in religious rituals!</verse>

			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Christ’s resurrection is your resurrection too. This is why we are to yearn for all that is above, for that’s where Christ sits enthroned at the place of all power, honor, and authority!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yes, feast on all the treasures of the heavenly realm and fill your thoughts with heavenly realities, and not with the distractions of the natural realm.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Your crucifixion with Christ has severed the tie to this life, and now your true life is hidden away in God in Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And as Christ himself is seen for who he really is, who you really are will also be revealed, for you are now one with him in his glory!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Live as one who has died to every form of sexual sin and impurity. Live as one who has died to the desires for forbidden things, including the desire for wealth, which is the essence of idol worship.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When you live in these vices you ignite the anger of God against these acts of disobedience.</verse>
				<verse number="7">That’s how you once behaved, characterized by your evil deeds. But now it’s time to eliminate them from your lives once and for all—anger, fits of rage, all forms of hatred, cursing, filthy speech,</verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">and lying. Lay aside your old Adam-self with its masquerade and disguise.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For you have acquired new creation life which is continually being renewed into the likeness of the One who created you; giving you the full revelation of God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">In this new creation life, your nationality makes no difference, nor your ethnicity, education, nor economic status— they matter nothing. For it is Christ that means everything as he lives in every one of us!</verse>
				<verse number="12">You are always and dearly loved by God! So robe yourself with virtues of God, since you have been divinely chosen to be holy. Be merciful as you endeavor to understand others, and be compassionate, showing kindness toward all. Be gentle and humble, unoffendable in your patience with others.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Tolerate the weaknesses of those in the family of faith, forgiving one another in the same way you have been graciously forgiven by Jesus Christ. If you find fault with someone, release this same gift of forgiveness to them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For love is supreme and must flow through each of these virtues. Love becomes the mark of true maturity.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Let your heart be always guided by the peace of the Anointed One, who called you to peace as part of his one body. And always be thankful.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Let the word of Christ live in you richly, flooding you with all wisdom. Apply the Scriptures as you teach and instruct one another with the Psalms, and with festive praises, and with prophetic songs given to you spontaneously by the Spirit, so sing to God with all your hearts!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Let every activity of your lives and every word that comes from your lips be drenched with the beauty of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One. And bring your constant praise to God the Father because of what Christ has done for you!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Let every wife be supportive and tenderly devoted to her husband, for this is a beautiful illustration of our devotion to Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Let every husband be filled with cherishing love for his wife and never be insensitive toward her.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Let the children respect and pay attention to their parents in everything for this pleases our Lord Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And fathers, don’t have unrealistic expectations for your children or else they may become discouraged.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Let every employee listen well and follow the instructions of their employer, not just when their employers are watching, and not in pretense, but faithful in all things. For we are to live our lives with pure hearts in the constant awe and wonder of our Lord God.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Put your heart and soul into every activity you do, as though you are doing it for the Lord himself and not merely for others.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For we know that we will receive a reward, an inheritance from the Lord, as we serve the Lord Yahweh, the Anointed One!</verse>
				<verse number="25">A disciple will be repaid for what he has learned and followed, for God pays no attention to the titles or prestige of men.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Employers, treat your workers with equality and justice as you know that you also have a Lord and Master in heaven who is watching you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Be faithful to pray as intercessors who are fully alert and giving thanks to God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And please pray for me, that God will open a door of opportunity for us to preach the revelation of the mystery of Christ, for whose sake I am imprisoned.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Pray that I would unfold and reveal fully this mystery, for that is my delightful assignment.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Walk in the wisdom of God as you live before the unbelievers, and make it your duty to make him known.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Let every word you speak be drenched with grace and tempered with truth and clarity. For then you will be prepared to give a respectful answer to anyone who asks about your faith.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Tychicus will tell you about what is happening with me. I have sent him to you so that he could find out how you are doing in your journey of faith, and bring comfort and encouragement to your hearts. For he is a beloved brother in Christ, a faithful servant of the gospel and my ministry partner in our Master Yahweh ’s work.</verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">I have also sent Onesimus, who is from your city, and is also a beloved and faithful brother who will inform you of all that we’re enduring.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Aristarchus, a fellow prisoner here with me, sends you his love. And Joshua (who is also called Justus) along with Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, also send you their loving greetings. You have already been informed that if Mark comes to you, receive him warmly. These three men are the only ones of the circumcision who have aided me here in the work of the kingdom of God, and they have been a great blessing to me.</verse>
				<verse number="11"></verse>
				<verse number="12">Epaphras, who is also from Colossae, sends his loving greetings. I can tell you that he is a true servant of Christ, who always labors and intercedes for you. His prayers are filled with requests to God that you would grow and mature, standing complete and perfect in the beauty of God’s plan for your lives. Epaphras has such great zeal and passion for you and for those who are from Laodicea and from Hierapolis.</verse>
				<verse number="13"></verse>
				<verse number="14">And Luke, the beloved physician, sends his warm greetings to you, and Demas also.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Give my greetings to all the believers in Laodicea. And pray for dear Nymphas and the church that gathers in her home.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Once you’ve read this letter publicly to the church, please send it on to the church of the Laodiceans, and make sure you read the letter that I wrote to them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Be sure you give Archippus this message: “Be faithful to complete the ministry you received from our Lord Jesus!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now finally, I, Paul, write this with my own handwriting, and I send my loving greetings to you! Remember me in my imprisonment. May the blessings of God’s grace overwhelm you! Love in Christ, Paul</verse>

		<book number="52">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, Silas, and Timothy. We send our greetings to you, the congregation of believers in Thessalonica, which is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. May God’s delightful grace and peace rest upon you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">We are grateful to God for your lives and we always pray for you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For we remember before our God and Father how you put your faith into practice, how your love motivates you to serve others, and how unrelenting is your hope-filled patience in our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Dear brothers and sisters, you are dearly loved by God and we know that he has chosen you to be his very own.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For our gospel came to you not merely in the form of words but in mighty power infused with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction. Surely you remember how we lived our lives transparently before you to encourage you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And you became followers of my example and the Lord’s when you received the word with the joy of the Holy Spirit, even though it resulted in tremendous trials and persecution.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now you have become an example for all the believers to follow throughout the provinces of Greece.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The message of the Lord has sounded out from you not only in Greece, but its echo has been heard in every place where people are hearing about your strong faith. We don’t need to brag on you,</verse>
				<verse number="9">for everyone tells the story of the kind of welcome you showed us when we first came to you. And everyone knows how wonderfully you turned to God from idols to serve the true and living God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And now you eagerly expect his Son from heaven—Jesus, the deliverer, whom he raised from the dead and who rescues us from the coming wrath.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">My dear brothers and sisters, it’s obvious that our ministry among you has proven to be fruitful.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And though we had already suffered greatly in Philippi, where we were shamefully mistreated, we were emboldened by faith in our God to fearlessly preach his wonderful gospel to you in spite of incredible opposition.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Our coming alongside you to encourage you was not out of some delusion, or impure motive, or an intention to mislead you,</verse>
				<verse number="4">but we have been approved by God to be those who preach the gospel. So our motivation to preach is not pleasing people but pleasing God, who thoroughly examines our hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="5">God is our witness that when we came to encourage you, we never once used cunning compliments as a pretext for greed,</verse>
				<verse number="6">nor did we crave the praises of men, whether you or others.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Even though we could have imposed upon you our demands as apostles of Christ, instead we showed you kindness and were gentle among you. We cared for you in the same way a nursing mother cares for her own children.</verse>
				<verse number="8">With a mother’s love and affectionate attachment to you, we were very happy to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our lives—because you had become so dear to us.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Beloved brothers and sisters, surely you remember how hard we labored among you. We worked night and day so that we would not become a burden to you while we preached the wonderful gospel of God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">With God as our witness you saw how we lived among you—in holiness, in godly relationships, and without fault.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And you know how affectionately we treated each one of you, like a loving father cares for his own children.</verse>
				<verse number="12">We comforted and encouraged you and challenged you to adopt a lifestyle worthy of God, who invites you into his kingdom and glory.</verse>
				<verse number="13">This is why we continually thank God for your lives, because you received our message wholeheartedly. You embraced it not as the fabrication of men but as the word of God. And the word continues to be an energizing force in you who believe.</verse>
				<verse number="14">My dear brothers and sisters, the same thing happened to you as happened to God’s churches in Christ Jesus that are in Judea. For you received the same kind of mistreatment from your fellow countrymen as they did from theirs, the Jews</verse>
				<verse number="15">who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and ran us out of town. They are offending God and hostile to everyone else</verse>
				<verse number="16">by hindering us from speaking to the unbelievers so that they might be saved. By so doing they are constantly filling up to the brim the measure of their guilt, and punishment has come upon them at last!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Beloved friends, we may have been torn away from you physically for a season, but never in our hearts. For we have had intense longings and have endeavored to come and see in your faces the reflection of this great love.</verse>
				<verse number="18">We miss you badly, and I personally wanted to come to you, trying again and again, but our adversary, Satan, blocked our way.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For what will be our confident hope, our exhilarating joy, or our wonderful trophy that we will boast in before our Lord Jesus at his appearing? It is you!</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yes, you are our glorious pride and joy!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">When we could bear it no longer, we decided that we would remain in Athens</verse>
				<verse number="2">and send Timothy in our place. He is our beloved brother and coworker with God in preaching the gospel. We knew he would strengthen your faith and encourage your hearts</verse>
				<verse number="3">so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions, for you know that we are destined for this.</verse>
				<verse number="4">In fact, when we were with you we forewarned you: “Suffering and persecution is coming.” And so it has happened, as you well know.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For this reason, when I could endure it no longer, I sent our brother to find out if your faith was still strong, for I was concerned that the tempter had somehow enticed you and our labor would have been in vain.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But now, Timothy has just returned to us and brought us the terrific news of your faith and love. He informed us that you still hold us dear in your hearts and that you long to see us as much as we long to see you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So, our dear brothers and sisters, in the midst of all our distress and difficulties, your steadfastness of faith has greatly encouraged our hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="8">We feel alive again as long as we know that you are standing firm in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="9">How could we ever thank God enough for all the wonderful joy that we feel before our God because of you?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Every night and day we sincerely and fervently pray that we may see you face-to-face and furnish you with whatever may be lacking in your faith.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now may our Father God and our precious Lord Jesus guide our steps on a path straight back to you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And may the Lord increase your love until it overflows toward one another and for all people, just as our love overflows toward you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then your hearts will be strengthened in holiness so that you may be flawless and pure before the face of our God and Father at the appearing of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones. Amen!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">And now, beloved brothers and sisters, since you have been mentored by us with respect to living for God and pleasing him, I appeal to you in the name of the Lord Jesus with this request: keep faithfully growing through our teachings even more and more.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For you already know the instructions we’ve shared with you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="3">God’s will is for you to be set apart for him in holiness and that you keep yourselves unpolluted from sexual defilement.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yes, each of you must guard your sexual purity with holiness and dignity,</verse>
				<verse number="5">not yielding to lustful passions like those who don’t know God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Never take selfish advantage of a brother or sister in this matter, for we’ve already told you and solemnly warned you that the Lord is the avenger in all these things.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For God’s call on our lives is not to a life of compromise and perversion but to a life surrounded in holiness.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Therefore, whoever rejects this instruction isn’t rejecting human authority but God himself, who gives us his precious gift —his Spirit of holiness.</verse>
				<verse number="9">There’s no need for anyone to say much to you about loving your fellow believers, for God is continually teaching you to unselfishly love one another.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Indeed, your love is what you’re known for throughout Macedonia. We urge you, beloved ones, to let this unselfish love increase and flow through you more and more.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Aspire to lead a calm and peaceful life as you mind your own business and earn your living, just as we’ve taught you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">By doing this you will live an honorable life, influencing others and commanding respect of even the unbelievers. Then you’ll be in need of nothing and not dependent upon others.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Beloved brothers and sisters, we want you to be quite certain about the truth concerning those who have passed away, so that you won’t be overwhelmed with grief like many others who have no hope.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, we also believe that God will bring with Jesus those who died while believing in him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">This is the word of the Lord: we who are alive in him and remain until the Lord appears will by no means have an advantage over those who have already died, for both will rise together.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For the Lord himself will appear with the declaration of victory, the shout of an archangel, and the trumpet blast of God. He will descend from the heavenly realm and command those who are dead in Christ to rise first.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then we who are alive will join them, transported together in clouds to have an encounter with the Lord in the air, and we will be forever joined with the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So encourage one another with these truths.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Now, beloved brothers and sisters, concerning the question of God’s precise times and specific seasons, you don’t need me to write anything to you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For you already know quite well that the day of the Lord will come unexpectedly and as a complete surprise.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For while some are saying, “Finally we have peace and security,” sudden destruction will arrive at their doorstep, like labor pains seizing a pregnant woman—and with no chance of escape!</verse>
				<verse number="4">But you, beloved brothers and sisters, are not living in the dark, allowing that day to creep up on you like a thief coming to steal.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For you are all children of the light and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night nor to darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="6">This is why we must not fall asleep, as the rest do, but keep wide awake and clearheaded.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For those who are asleep sleep the night away, and drunkards get drunk at night.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But since we belong to the day, we must stay alert and clearheaded by placing the breastplate of faith and love over our hearts, and a helmet of the hope of salvation over our thoughts.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For God has not destined us for wrath but to possess salvation through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He gave his life for us so that we may share in resurrection life in union with him—whether we’re awake or asleep.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Because of this, encourage the hearts of your fellow believers and support one another, just as you have already been doing.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Dear brothers and sisters, make sure that you show your deep appreciation for those who cherish you and diligently work as ministers among you. For they are your leaders who care for you, teach you, and stand before the Lord on your behalf.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They value you with great love. Because of their service to you, let peace reign among yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="14">We appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, to instruct those who are not in their place of battle. Be skilled at gently encouraging those who feel themselves inadequate. Be faithful to stand your ground. Help the weak to stand again. Be quick to demonstrate patience with everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Resist revenge, and make sure that no one pays back evil in place of evil but always pursue doing what is beautiful to one another and to all the unbelievers.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Let joy be your continual feast.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Make your life a prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And in the midst of everything be always giving thanks, for this is God’s perfect plan for you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Never restrain or put out the fire of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And don’t be one who scorns prophecies,</verse>
				<verse number="21">but be faithful to examine them by putting them to the test, and afterward hold tightly to what has proven to be right.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Avoid every appearance of evil.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now, may the God of peace and harmony set you apart, making you completely holy. And may your entire being—spirit, soul, and body—be kept completely flawless in the appearing of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The one who calls you by name is trustworthy and will thoroughly complete his work in you.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now, beloved ones, pray for us.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Greet every brother and sister with a sacred kiss.</verse>
				<verse number="27">I solemnly plead with you before the Lord to make sure that every holy believer among you has the opportunity to hear this letter read to them.</verse>
				<verse number="28">May grace from our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen!</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, Silas, and Timothy. We send our greetings to you, the Thessalonian congregation of believers, which is in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="2">May God’s delightful grace and peace rest upon you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">We feel a personal responsibility to continually be thanking God for you, our spiritual family, every time we pray. And we have every reason to do so because your faith is growing marvelously beyond measure. The unselfish love each of you share for one another is increasing and overflowing!</verse>
				<verse number="4">We point to you as an example of unwavering faith for all the churches of God. We boast about how you continue to demonstrate unflinching endurance through all the persecutions and painful trials you are experiencing.</verse>
				<verse number="5">All of this proves that God’s judgment is always perfect and is intended to make you worthy of inheriting the kingdom of God, which is why you are going through these troubles.</verse>
				<verse number="6">It is right and just for God to trouble your troublers</verse>
				<verse number="7">and give rest to the troubled, both to you and to us, at the unveiling of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his messengers of power</verse>
				<verse number="8">within a flame of fire. He will bring perfect and full justice to those who don’t know God and on those who refuse to embrace the gospel of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They will suffer the penalty of eternal destruction, banished from the Lord’s presence and from the manifestation of his glorious power.</verse>
				<verse number="10">This will happen on that day when he glorifies his holy ones, and they will be marveled at in all those who believed—including you, since in fact, you believed our message.</verse>
				<verse number="11">With this in mind, we constantly pray that our God will empower you to live worthy of all that he has invited you to experience. And we pray that by his power all the pleasures of goodness and all works inspired by faith would fill you completely.</verse>
				<verse number="12">By doing this the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you, and you will be glorified in him, by the marvelous grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Now, regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him, we plead with you, beloved friends,</verse>
				<verse number="2">not to be easily confused or disturbed in your minds by any kind of spirit, rumor, or letter allegedly from us, claiming that the day of the Lord has already come.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way. Before that day comes the rebellion must occur and the “outlaw” —the destructive son—will be revealed in his true light.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He is the opposing counterpart who exalts himself over everything that is called “God” or is worshiped and who sits enthroned in God’s temple and makes himself out to be a god.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Don’t you remember that when I was with you I went over all these things?</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now you are aware of the ruling power so that he may be fully revealed when his time comes.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For the mystery of lawlessness is already active, but the one who prevails will do so until he is separated from out of the midst.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the “outlaw” will be openly revealed, and the Lord will overthrow him by the breath of his mouth and bring him to an end by the dazzling manifestation of his presence.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The presence of the “outlaw” is apparent by the activity of Satan, who uses all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs, spurious wonders,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and every form of evil deception in order to deceive those who are perishing because they rejected the love of the truth that would lead them to being saved.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Because of this, God sends them a powerful delusion that leads them to believe what is false.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So then all who found their pleasure in unrighteousness and did not believe the truth will be judged.</verse>
				<verse number="13">We always have to thank God for you, brothers and sisters, for you are dearly loved by the Lord. He proved it by choosing you from the beginning for salvation through the Spirit, who set you apart for holiness, and through your belief in the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="14">To this end he handpicked you for salvation through the gospel so that you would have the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So then, dear family, stand firm with a masterful grip of the teachings we gave you, either by word of mouth or by our letter.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now may the Lord Jesus Christ and our Father God, who loved us and in his wonderful grace gave us eternal comfort and a beautiful hope that cannot fail,</verse>
				<verse number="17">encourage your hearts and inspire you with strength to always do and speak what is good and beautiful in his eyes.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Finally, dear brothers and sisters, pray for us that the Lord’s message will continue to spread rapidly and its glory be recognized everywhere, just as it was with you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And pray that God will rescue us from wicked and evil people, for not everyone believes the message.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But the Lord Yahweh is always faithful to place you on a firm foundation and guard you from the Evil One.</verse>
				<verse number="4">We have complete confidence in the Lord concerning you and we are sure that you are doing and will continue to do what we have told you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now may the Lord move your hearts into a greater understanding of God’s pure love for you and into Christ’s steadfast endurance.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Beloved brothers and sisters, we instruct you, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to stay away from believers who are unruly and who stray from all that we have taught you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For you know very well that you should order your lives after our example, because we were not undisciplined when we were with you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">We didn’t sponge off of you, but we worked hard night and day to provide our own food and lodging and not be a burden to any of you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">It wasn’t because we don’t have the right to be supported, but we wanted to provide you an example to follow.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For when we were with you we instructed you with these words: “Anyone who does not want to work for a living should go hungry.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now, we hear rumors that some of you are being lazy and neglecting to work—that these people are not busy but busybodies!</verse>
				<verse number="12">So with the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, we order them to go back to work in an orderly fashion and exhort them to earn their own living.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Brothers and sisters, don’t ever grow weary in doing what is right.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Take special note of anyone who won’t obey what we have written and stay away from them, so that they would be ashamed and get turned around.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yet don’t regard them as enemies, but caution them as fellow believers.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now, may the Lord himself, the Lord of peace, pour into you his peace in every circumstance and in every possible way. The Lord’s tangible presence be with you all.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So now, in my own handwriting, I add these words: Loving greetings to each of you. And may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Paul The above is my signature and the token of authenticity in every letter I write.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, an apostle in Christ Jesus, for it was Jesus himself, our living hope, who sent me as his servant by the command of God, our life-giver.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Timothy, you are my true spiritual son in the faith. May abundant grace, mercy, and total well-being from God the Father and the Anointed One, our Lord Jesus, be yours!</verse>
				<verse number="3">As I urged you when I left for Macedonia, I’m asking that you remain in Ephesus to instruct them not to teach or follow the error of deceptive doctrines,</verse>
				<verse number="4">nor pay any attention to cultural myths, traditions, or the endless study of genealogies. Those digressions only breed controversies and debates. They are devoid of power that builds up and strengthens the church in the faith of God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For we reach the goal of fulfilling all the commandments when we love others deeply with a pure heart, a clean conscience, and sincere faith.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Some believers have been led astray by teachings and speculations that emphasize nothing more than the empty words of men.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They presume to be expert teachers of the law, but they don’t have the slightest idea of what they’re talking about and they simply love to argue!</verse>
				<verse number="8">We know that the moral code of the law is beautiful when applied as God intended,</verse>
				<verse number="9">but actually, the law was not established for righteous people, but to bring conviction of sin to the unrighteous. The law was established to bring the revelation of sin to the evildoers and rebellious, the sinners without God, those who are vicious and perverse, and to those who strike their father or their mother, sinners, murderers,</verse>
				<verse number="10">rapists, those who are sexually impure, homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, those who break their oaths, and all those who oppose the teaching of godliness and purity in the church! They are the ones the law is for.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I have been commissioned to preach the wonderful news of the glory of the exalted God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">My heart spills over with thanks to God for the way he continually empowers me, and to our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, who found me trustworthy and who authorized me to be his partner in this ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Mercy kissed me, even though I used to be a blasphemer, a persecutor of believers, and a scorner of what turned out to be true. I was ignorant and didn’t know what I was doing.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I was flooded with such incredible grace, like a river overflowing its banks, until I was full of faith and love for Jesus, the Anointed One!</verse>
				<verse number="15">I can testify that the Word is true and deserves to be received by all, for Jesus Christ came into the world to bring sinners back to life—even me, the worst sinner of all!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yet I was captured by grace, so that Jesus Christ could display through me the outpouring of his Spirit as a pattern to be seen for all those who would believe in him for eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Because of this my praises rise to the King of all the universe who is indestructible, invisible, and full of glory, the only God who is worthy of the highest honors throughout all of time and throughout the eternity of eternities! Amen!</verse>
				<verse number="18">So Timothy, my son, I am entrusting you with this responsibility, in keeping with the very first prophecies that were spoken over your life, and are now in the process of fulfillment in this great work of ministry, in keeping with the prophecies spoken over you. With this encouragement use your prophecies as weapons as you wage spiritual warfare by faith and with a clean conscience. For there are many who reject these virtues and are now destitute of the true faith,</verse>
				<verse number="19"></verse>
				<verse number="20">such as Hymenaeus and Alexander who have fallen away. I have delivered them both over to Satan to be rid of them and to teach them to no longer blaspheme!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Most of all, I’m writing to encourage you to pray with gratitude to God. Pray for all men with all forms of prayers and requests as you intercede with intense passion.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And pray for every political leader and representative, so that we would be able to live tranquil, undisturbed lives, as we worship the awe-inspiring God with pure hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="3">It is pleasing to our Savior-God to pray for them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He longs for everyone to embrace his life and return to the full knowledge of the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For God is one, and there is one Mediator between God and the sons of men—the true man, Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He gave himself as ransom-payment for everyone. Now is the proper time for God to give the world this witness.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I have been divinely called as an apostle to preach this revelation, which is the truth. God has called me to be a trustworthy teacher to the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Therefore, I encourage the men to pray on every occasion with hands lifted to God in worship with clean hearts, free from frustration or strife.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And that the women would also pray with clean hearts, dressed appropriately and adorned modestly and sensibly, not flaunting their wealth.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But they should be recognized instead by their beautiful deeds of kindness, suitable as one who worships God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Let the women who are new converts be willing to learn with all submission to their leaders and not speak out of turn.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I don’t advocate that the newly converted women be the teachers in the church, assuming authority over the men, but to live in peace.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For God formed Adam first, then Eve.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Adam did not mislead Eve, but Eve misled him and violated the command of God.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yet salvation will come through a child born by a woman, and women will be saved by that “child” if they continue in faith with love, holiness, and self-control.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">If any of you aspires to be an overseer in the church; you have set your heart toward a noble ambition, for the word is true!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yet an elder needs to be one who is without blame before others. He should be one whose heart is for his wife alone and not another woman. He should be recognized as one who is sensible, and well-behaved, and living a disciplined life. He should be a “spiritual shepherd” who has the gift of teaching, and is known for his hospitality.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He cannot be a drunkard, or someone who lashes out at others, or argumentative, or someone who simply craves more money, but instead, recognized by his gentleness.</verse>
				<verse number="4">His heart should be set on guiding his household with wisdom and dignity; bringing up his children to worship with devotion and purity.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For if he’s unable to properly lead his own household well, how could he properly lead God’s household?</verse>
				<verse number="6">He should not be a new disciple who would be vulnerable to living in the clouds of conceit and fall into pride, making him easy prey for Satan.</verse>
				<verse number="7">He should be respected by those who are unbelievers, having a beautiful testimony among them so that he will not fall into the traps of Satan and be disgraced.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And in the same way the deacons must be those who are pure and true to their word, not addicted to wine, or with greedy eyes on the contributions.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Instead, they must faithfully embrace the mysteries of faith while keeping a clean conscience.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And each of them must be found trustworthy according to these standards before they are given the responsibility to minister as servant-leaders without blame.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And the women also who serve the church should be dignified, faithful in all things, having their thoughts set on truth, and not known as those who gossip.</verse>
				<verse number="12">A deacon’s heart must be toward his wife alone, leading his children and household with excellence.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For those who serve in this way will obtain an honorable reputation for themselves and a greater right to speak boldly in the faith that comes from Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="14">I’m writing all this with the expectation of seeing you soon.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But if I’m delayed in coming, you’ll already have these instructions on how to conduct the affairs of the church of the living God, his very household and the supporting pillar and firm foundation of the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For the mystery of righteousness is beyond all question! He was revealed as a human being, and as our great High Priest in the Spirit! Angels gazed upon him as a man and the glorious message of his kingly rulership is being preached to the nations! Many have believed in him and he has been taken back to heaven, and has ascended into the place of exalted glory in the heavenly realm. Yes, great is this mystery of righteousness!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">The Holy Spirit has explicitly revealed: At the end of this age, many will depart from the true faith one after another, devoting themselves to spirits of deception and following demon-inspired revelations and theories.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Hypocritical liars will deceive many, and their consciences won’t bother them at all!</verse>
				<verse number="3">They will require celibacy and dietary restrictions that God doesn’t expect, for he created all foods to be received with the celebration of faith by those who fully know the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="4">We know that all creation is beautiful to God and there is nothing to be refused if it is received with gratitude.</verse>
				<verse number="5">All that we eat is made sacred by the Word of God and prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="6">If you will teach the believers these things, you will be known as a faithful and good minister of Jesus, the Anointed One. Nurture others in the living words of faith and in the knowledge of grace which you were taught.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Be quick to abstain from senseless traditions and legends, but instead be engaged in the training of truth that brings righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For athletic training only benefits you for a short season, but righteousness brings lasting benefit in everything; for righteousness contains the promise of life, for time and eternity.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Faithful is the Word, and everyone should accept him!</verse>
				<verse number="10">For the sake of this ministry, we toil tirelessly and are criticized continually, simply because our hope is in the living God. He is the wonderful life-giver of all the children of men, and even more so to those who believe.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Instruct and teach the people all that I’ve taught you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And don’t be intimidated by those who are older than you; simply be the example they need to see by being faithful and true in all that you do. Speak the truth and live a life of purity and authentic love as you remain strong in your faith.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So until I come, be diligent in devouring the Word of God, be faithful in prayer, and in teaching the believers.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Don’t minimize the powerful gift that operates in your life, for it was imparted to you by the laying on of hands of the elders and was activated through the prophecy they spoke over you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Make all of this your constant meditation and make it real with your life so everyone can see that you are moving forward.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Give careful attention to your spiritual life and every cherished truth you teach, for living what you preach will release salvation inside you and to all those who listen to you.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Don’t be harsh or verbally abusive to an older man; it is better to appeal to him as a father. And as you minister to the younger men it is best to encourage them as your dear brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Honor the older women as mothers, and the younger women, treat as your dear sisters with utmost purity.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The church needs to honor and support the widows, especially those who are in dire need.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But if they have children or grandchildren at home, then it is only proper to let them provide for the ones who raised them when they were children, for kindness begins at home and it pleases God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For the true widow is all alone and has placed her complete hope in God. She is Messiah’s missionary and will need the support of the church as one who remains in prayer day and night.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But the widow who serves only herself lives a life of self-indulgence and is wasting her life away.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Be sure to give clear instruction concerning these matters so that none of them will live with shame.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For if a believer fails to provide for their own relatives when they are in need, they have compromised their convictions of faith and need to be corrected, for they are living worse than the unbelievers.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The widows who are worthy to be supported by the church should be at least sixty years old and not remarried.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They should have a beautiful testimony of raising their families, practicing hospitality, encouraging other believers, comforting troubled ones, and have a reputation for doing good works.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But you need not concern yourself with the younger widows, for some will depart from the Messiah because of their desire to remarry.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For they will face their own punishment of living with a disturbed conscience for invalidating their former faith.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Those widows who go around from house to house as busybodies are only learning to be lazy, making their situation even worse by talking too much, gossiping, and speaking things they shouldn’t. They become far too obsessed with empty things that will not bear good fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For this reason, teach the younger women to remarry and bear children and care for their household. This will keep them from giving our adversary a reason to gloat.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For there are already those who have begun to turn aside from their faith and are influenced by Satan.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So if any believer has a widow in their family, instruct them to support her financially so that the church will not be burdened with her care. This will leave finances available for those widows who are truly in need.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The pastors who lead the church well should be paid well. They should receive double honor for faithfully preaching and teaching the revelation of the Word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For the Scriptures have taught us: “Do not muzzle an ox or forbid it to eat while it grinds the grain.” And also, “The one who labors deserves his wages.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Refuse to listen to suspicious accusations against the pastors who lead the flock unless you have two or three witnesses to confirm the accusations.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But if indeed you find that they have sinned, bring correction to them before the congregation so that the rest of the people will respect you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Timothy, in the presence of God and our Lord Jesus Christ, and before the chosen messengers, I solemnly charge you to put into practice all these matters without bias, prejudice, or favoritism.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Don’t be hasty to ordain them with the laying on of hands, or you may end up sharing in their guilt should they fall. Keep yourself pure and holy with your standards high.</verse>
				<verse number="23">(If drinking the water causes you to have stomach ailments, drink some wine instead.)</verse>
				<verse number="24">The sins of some people stand out and are well known. Yet there are others whose sins are not as obvious, but the truth of who they really are will eventually be seen and will bring them judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="25">It is the same way with good works, even if they are not known at first, they will eventually be recognized and acknowledged.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Instruct every employee to respect and honor their employers, for this attitude presents to them a clear testimony of God’s truth and renown. Tell them to never provide them with a reason to discredit God’s name because of their actions.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Especially honor and respect employers who are believers and don’t despise them, but serve them even more, for they are fellow believers. They should be at peace with them as beloved members of God’s family. Be faithful to teach them these things as their sacred obligation.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But if anyone spreads false teaching that does not agree with the healthy instruction of our Lord Jesus, teaching others that holy awe of God is not important, then they prove they know nothing at all! It’s obvious they don’t value or hold dear the healing words of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They are covered with the clouds of conceit. They are loaded with controversy, and they love to argue their opinions and split hairs. The fruit of their ministry is contention, competition, and evil suspicions.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They add misery to many lives by corrupting their minds and cheating them of the truth. They equate the worship of God with making great sums of money.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We have a “profit” that is greater than theirs—our holy awe of God! To have merely our necessities is to have enough.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Isn’t it true that our hands were empty when we came into the world, and when we leave this world our hands will be empty again?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Because of this, food and clothing is enough to make us content.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But those who crave the wealth of this world slip into spiritual snares. They become trapped by the troubles that come through their foolish and harmful desires, driven by greed and drowning in their own sinful pleasures. And they take others down with them into their corruption and eventual destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Loving money is a root of all evils. Some people run after it so much that they have given up their faith. Craving more money pushes them away from the faith into error, compounding misery in their lives!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Timothy, you are God’s man, so run from all these errors. Instead, chase after true holiness, justice, faithfulness, love, hope, and tender humility.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So fight with faith for the winner’s prize! Lay your hands upon eternal life, to which you were called and about which you made the good confession before the multitude of witnesses!</verse>
				<verse number="13">So now, I instruct you before the God of resurrection life and before Jesus, the Anointed One, who demonstrated a beautiful testimony even before Pontius Pilate,</verse>
				<verse number="14">that you follow this commission faithfully with a clear conscience and without blemish until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yes, God will make his appearing in his own divine timing, for he is the exalted God, the only powerful One, the King over every king, and the Lord of power!</verse>
				<verse number="16">He alone is the immortal God, living in the unapproachable light of divine glory! No one has ever seen his fullness, nor can they, for all the glory and endless authority of the universe belongs to him, forever and ever. Amen!</verse>
				<verse number="17">To all the rich of this world, I command you not to be wrapped in thoughts of pride over your prosperity, or rely on your wealth, for your riches are unreliable and nothing compared to the living God. Trust instead in the one who lavishes upon us all good things, fulfilling our every need.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Remind the wealthy to be rich in remarkable works of extravagant generosity, willing to share with others.</verse>
				<verse number="19">These spiritual investments will provide a beautiful foundation for their lives and secure for them a great future, as they lay their hands upon the meaning of true life.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So, my son Timothy, don’t forget all that has been deposited within you. Escape from the empty echoes of men and the perversion of twisted reasoning.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For those who claim to possess this so-called knowledge have already wandered from the true faith. May God’s grace empower you always! Love in Christ, Paul</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, an apostle of Jesus the Messiah, appointed by God’s pleasure to announce the wonderful promise of life found in Jesus, the anointed Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">My beloved son, I pray for a greater release of God’s grace, love, and total well-being to flow into your life from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="3">You know that I’ve been called to serve the God of my fathers with a clean conscience. Night and day I pray constantly for you, building a memorial for you with my prayers.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I know that you have wept for me, your spiritual father, and your tears are dear to me. I can’t wait to see you again! I’m filled with joy</verse>
				<verse number="5">as I think of your strong faith that was passed down through your family line. It began with your grandmother Lois, who passed it on to your dear mother, Eunice. And it’s clear that you too are following in the footsteps of their godly example.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I’m writing to encourage you to fan into a flame and rekindle the fire of the spiritual gift God imparted to you when I laid my hands upon you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For God will never give you the spirit of fear, but the Holy Spirit who gives you mighty power, love, and self-control.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So never be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor be embarrassed over my imprisonment, but overcome every evil by the revelation of the power of God!</verse>
				<verse number="9">He gave us resurrection life and drew us to himself by his holy calling on our lives. And it wasn’t because of any good we have done, but by his divine pleasure and marvelous grace that confirmed our union with the anointed Jesus, even before time began!</verse>
				<verse number="10">This truth is now being unveiled by the revelation of the anointed Jesus, our life-giver, who has dismantled death, obliterating all its effects on our lives, and has manifested his immortal life in us by the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And he has anointed me as his preacher, his apostle, and his teacher of truth to the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The confidence of my calling enables me to overcome every difficulty without shame, for I have an intimate revelation of this God. And my faith in him convinces me that he is more than able to keep all that I’ve placed in his hands safe and secure until the fullness of his appearing.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Allow the healing words you’ve heard from me to live in you and make them a model for life as your faith and love for the Anointed One grows even more.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Guard well this incomparable treasure by the Spirit of Holiness living within you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Perhaps you’ve heard that Phygelus, and Hermogenes and all the believers of Asia have deserted me because of my imprisonment.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Nevertheless, so many times Onesiphorus was like a breath of fresh air to me and never seemed to be ashamed of my chains. May our Lord Jesus bestow compassion and mercy upon him and his household.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For when he arrived in Rome, he searched and searched for me until he found out where I was being held, so that he could minister to me,</verse>
				<verse number="18">just like he did so wonderfully as I rested in his house while in Ephesus, as you well know. May Jesus, our Master, give him abundant mercy in the day he stands before him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Timothy, my dear son, live your life empowered by God’s free-flowing grace, which is your true strength, found in the anointing of Jesus and your union with him!</verse>
				<verse number="2">And all that you’ve learned from me, confirmed by the integrity of my life, deposit into faithful leaders who are competent to teach the congregations the same revelation.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Overcome every form of evil as a victorious soldier of Jesus the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For every soldier called to active duty must divorce himself from the distractions of this world so that he may fully satisfy the one who chose him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">An athlete who doesn’t play by the rules will never receive the trophy, so remain faithful to God!</verse>
				<verse number="6">The farmer who labors to produce a crop should be the first one to be fed from its harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Carefully consider all that I’ve taught you, and may our Lord inspire you with wisdom and revelation in everything you say and do.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But make Jesus, the Anointed One, your focus in life and ministry. For he came to earth as the descendant of David and rose from the dead, according to the revelation of the gospel that God has given me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">This is the reason I am persecuted and imprisoned by evildoers, enduring the suffering of these chains—but the Word of God can never be chained!</verse>
				<verse number="10">I endure all these hardships for the benefit of the chosen ones in Christ so that they may also discover the overcoming life that is in Jesus Christ, and experience a glory that lasts forever!</verse>
				<verse number="11">You can trust these words: If we were joined with him in his death, then we are joined with him in his life!</verse>
				<verse number="12">If we are joined with him in his sufferings, then we will reign together with him in his triumph. But if we disregard him, then he will also disregard us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But even if we are faithless, he will still be full of faith, for he never wavers in his faithfulness to us!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Be committed to teach the believers all these things when you are with them in the presence of the Lord. Instruct them to never be drawn into meaningless arguments, or tear each other down with useless words that only harm others.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Always be eager to present yourself before God as a perfect and mature minister, without shame, as one who correctly explains the Word of Truth.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And avoid empty chatter and worthless words, for they simply add to the irreverence of those who converse in that manner.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the words of Hymenaeus and Philetus are like gangrene, they have already spread their poison to many.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They are lost to the truth and teach gross error when they teach that the resurrection of the dead has already passed. They are guilty of subverting the faith of some believers.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But the firm foundation of God has written upon it these two inscriptions: “The Lord God recognizes those who are truly his!” and, “Everyone who worships the name of the Lord Jesus must forsake wickedness!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">In a palace you find many kinds of containers and tableware for many different uses. Some are beautifully inlaid with gold or silver, but some are made of wood or earthenware; some of them are used for banquets and special occasions, and some for everyday use.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But you, Timothy, must not see your life and ministry this way. Your life and ministry must not be disgraced, for you are to be a pure container of Christ and dedicated to the honorable purposes of your Master, prepared for every good work that he gives you to do.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Run as fast as you can from all the ambitions and lusts of youth; and chase after all that is pure. Whatever builds up your faith and deepens your love must become your holy pursuit. And live in peace with all those who worship our Lord Jesus with pure hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Stay away from all the foolish arguments of the immature, for these disputes will only generate more conflict.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For a true servant of our Lord Jesus will not be argumentative but gentle toward all and skilled in helping others see the truth, having great patience toward the immature.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then with meekness you’ll be able to carefully enlighten those who argue with you so they can see God’s gracious gift of repentance and be brought to the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="26">This will cause them to rediscover themselves and escape from the snare of Satan who caught them in his trap so that they would carry out his purposes.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">But you need to be aware that in the final days the culture of society will become extremely fierce.</verse>
				<verse number="2">People will be self-centered lovers of themselves and obsessed with money. They will boast of great things as they strut around in their arrogant pride and mock all that is right. They will ignore their own families. They will be ungrateful and ungodly.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They will become addicted to hateful and malicious slander. Slaves to their desires, they will be ferocious, belligerent haters of what is good and right.</verse>
				<verse number="4">With brutal treachery, they will act without restraint, bigoted and wrapped in clouds of their conceit. They will find their delight in the pleasures of this world more than the pleasures of the loving God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They may pretend to have a respect for God, but in reality they want nothing to do with God’s power. Stay away from people like these!</verse>
				<verse number="6">For they are the ones who worm their way into the hearts of vulnerable women, spending the night with those who are captured by their lusts and steeped in sin.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They are always learning but never discover the revelation-knowledge of truth.</verse>
				<verse number="8">History has given us an example of this with the Egyptian sorcerers Jannes and Jambres, who stood against Moses in their arrogance. So it will be in the last days with those who reject the faith with their corrupt minds and arrogant hearts, standing against the truth of God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But they will not advance, for everyone will see their madness, just as they did with Jannes and Jambres!</verse>
				<verse number="10">But you, Timothy, have closely followed my example and the truth that I’ve imparted to you. You have modeled your life after the love and endurance I’ve demonstrated in my ministry by not giving up. The faith I have, you now have. What I have hungered for in life has now become your longing as well. The patience I have with others, you now demonstrate.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And the same persecutions and difficulties I have endured, you have also endured. Yes, you know all about what I had to suffer while in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You’re aware of all the persecution I endured there; yet the Lord delivered me from every single one of them!</verse>
				<verse number="12">For all who choose to live godly as worshipers of Jesus, the Anointed One, will also experience persecution.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But the evil men and sorcerers will progress from bad to worse, deceived and deceiving, as they lead people further from the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yet you must continue to advance in strength with the truth wrapped around your heart, being assured by God that he’s the One who has truly taught you all these things.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Remember what you were taught from your childhood from the Holy Scrolls which can impart to you wisdom to experience everlasting life through the faith of Jesus, the Anointed One!</verse>
				<verse number="16">God has transmitted his very substance into every Scripture, for it is God-breathed. It will empower you by its instruction and correction, giving you the strength to take the right direction and lead you deeper into the path of godliness.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then you will be God’s servant, fully mature and perfectly prepared to fulfill any assignment God gives you.</verse>

			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Timothy, in the presence of our great God and our Lord Jesus Christ, the One who is destined to judge both the living and the dead by the revelation of his kingdom—I solemnly instruct you to</verse>
				<verse number="2">proclaim the Word of God and stand upon it no matter what! Rise to the occasion and preach when it is convenient and when it is not. Preach in the full expression of the Holy Spirit —with wisdom and patience as you instruct and teach the people.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For the time is coming when they will no longer listen and respond to the healing words of truth because they will become selfish and proud. They will seek out teachers with soothing words that line up with their desires, saying just what they want to hear.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They will close their ears to the truth and believe nothing but fables and myths.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So be alert to all these things and overcome every form of evil. Carry in your heart the passion of your calling as a church planter and evangelist, and fulfill your ministry calling.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And now the time is fast approaching for my release from this life and I am ready to be offered as a sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I have fought an excellent fight. I have finished my full course with all my might and I’ve kept my heart full of faith.</verse>
				<verse number="8">There’s a crown of righteousness waiting in heaven for me, and I know that my Lord will reward me on his day of righteous judgment. And this crown is not only waiting for me, but for all who love and long for his unveiling.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Please come as soon as you can</verse>
				<verse number="10">since Demas deserted me and has left to go to Thessalonica, for he loves his own life. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus has gone to Dalmatia.</verse>
				<verse number="11">That leaves only Luke with me, so find Mark and bring him with you, for he is a tremendous help for me in my ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I have also dispatched Tychicus to Ephesus to minister there.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When you come, please bring the leather book bag along with the books I left in Troas with Carpus—especially the parchment scrolls.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You need to know that Alexander, the jeweler, has done me great harm. May our Lord give him what he deserves for all he has done.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Be careful of him, for he arrogantly opposes our ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="16">At first there was no one I could count on to faithfully stand with me—they all ran off and abandoned me—but don’t hold this against them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For in spite of this, my Lord himself stood with me, empowering me to complete my ministry of preaching to all the non-Jewish nations so they all could hear the message and be delivered from the mouth of the lion!</verse>
				<verse number="18">And my Lord will continue to deliver me from every form of evil and give me life in his heavenly kingdom. May all the glory go to him alone for all the ages of eternity!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Please give my warm regards to Prisca and to Aquila and to Onesiphorus and his family.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Erastus has remained in Corinth, but Trophimus I had to leave in Miletus due to his illness.</verse>

				<verse number="1">From Paul, God’s willing slave and an apostle of Jesus, the Anointed One, to Titus. I’m writing to you to further the faith of God’s chosen ones and lead them to the full knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,</verse>
				<verse number="2">which rests on the hope of eternal life. God, who never lies, has promised this before time began.</verse>
				<verse number="3">In his own time he unveiled his word through the preaching of the gospel, which was entrusted to me by the command of God our Life Giver.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Titus, you are my true son in the faith we share. May grace and peace descend to you from God the Father and our Savior, the Anointed One, Jesus!</verse>
				<verse number="5">The reason I stationed you in Crete was so that you could set things in order and complete what was left unfinished, and to raise up and appoint church elders in every city, just as I had instructed you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Each of them must be above reproach, devoted solely to his wife, whose children are believers and not rebellious or out of control.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The overseer, since he serves God’s household, must be someone of blameless character and not be opinionated or short-tempered. He must not be a drunkard or violent or greedy.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Instead he should be one who is known for his hospitality and a lover of goodness. He should be recognized as one who is fair-minded, pure-hearted, and self-controlled.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He must have a firm grasp of the trustworthy message that he has been taught. This will enable him to both encourage others with healthy teachings and provide convincing answers to those who oppose his message.</verse>
				<verse number="10">There are many wayward people, smooth talkers, and deceivers—especially the converts from Judaism.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They must be silenced because they are disrupting entire families with their corrupt teachings, all for their dishonest greed.</verse>
				<verse number="12">A certain one of them, one of their own prophets, said, “Those Cretans are nothing but liars, worthless beasts, and lazy gluttons.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">He certainly knew what he was talking about! For this reason, correct them thoroughly so that their lives will line up with the truths of our faith.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Instruct them not to pay any attention to Jewish myths or follow the teachings of those who reject the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="15">It’s true that all is pure to those who have pure hearts, but to the corrupt unbelievers nothing is pure. Their minds and consciences are defiled.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are disgusting, disobedient, and disqualified from doing anything good.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Your duty is to teach them to embrace a lifestyle that is consistent with sound doctrine.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Lead the male elders into disciplined lives full of dignity and self-control. Urge them to have a solid faith, generous love, and patient endurance.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Likewise with the female elders, lead them into lives free from gossip and drunkenness and to be teachers of beautiful things.</verse>
				<verse number="4">This will enable them to teach the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
				<verse number="5">and to be self-controlled and pure, taking care of their household and being devoted to their husbands. By doing these things the word of God will not be discredited.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Likewise, guide the younger men into living disciplined lives for Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Above all, set yourself apart as a model of a life nobly lived. With dignity, demonstrate integrity in all that you teach.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Bring a clear, wholesome message that cannot be condemned, and then your critics will be embarrassed, with nothing bad to say about us.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Servants are to be supportive of their masters and do what is pleasing in every way. They are not to be argumentative</verse>
				<verse number="10">nor steal but prove themselves to be completely loyal and trustworthy. By doing this they will advertise through all that they do the beautiful teachings of God our Savior.</verse>
				<verse number="11">God’s marvelous grace has manifested in person, bringing salvation for everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="12">This same grace teaches us how to live each day as we turn our backs on ungodliness and indulgent lifestyles, and it equips us to live self-controlled, upright, godly lives in this present age.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For we continue to wait for the fulfillment of our hope in the dawning splendor of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He sacrificed himself for us that he might purchase our freedom from every lawless deed and to purify for himself a people who are his very own, passionate to do what is beautiful in his eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So preach these truths and exhort others to follow them. Be willing to expose sin in order to bring correction with full authority, without being intimidated by anyone.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Remind people to respect their governmental leaders on every level as law-abiding citizens and to be ready to fulfill their civic duty.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And remind them to never tear down anyone with their words or quarrel, but instead be considerate, humble, and courteous to everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For it wasn’t that long ago that we behaved foolishly in our stubborn disobedience. We were easily led astray as slaves to worldly passions and pleasures. We wasted our lives in doing evil, and with hateful jealousy we hated others.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When the extraordinary compassion of God our Savior and his overpowering love suddenly appeared in person, as the brightness of a dawning day,</verse>
				<verse number="5">he came to save us. Not because of any virtuous deed that we have done but only because of his extravagant mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He saved us, resurrecting us through the washing of rebirth. We are made completely new by the Holy Spirit, whom he splashed over us richly by Jesus, the Messiah, our Life Giver.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So as a gift of his love, and since we are faultless— innocent before his face— we can now become heirs of all things, all because of an overflowing hope of eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="8">How true and faithful is this message! I want you to especially emphasize these truths, so that those who believe in God will be careful to devote themselves to doing good works. It is always beautiful and profitable for believers to do good works.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But avoid useless controversies, genealogies, pointless quarrels, and arguments over the law, which will get you nowhere.</verse>
				<verse number="10">After a first and second warning, have nothing more to do with a divisive person who refuses to be corrected.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For you know that such a one is entwined with his sin and stands self-condemned.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, be sure to meet me at the City of Victory, for I’ve decided to spend the winter there.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Give a generous send-off to Zenas the scribe and Apollos, and send them on their journey with what they need.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Encourage the believers to be passionately devoted to beautiful works of righteousness by meeting the urgent needs of others and not be unfruitful.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Everyone here with me sends their loving greetings to you. Greet the believers who love us in the faith. May God’s wonderful grace be with you all! Love in Christ, Paul</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, a prisoner of the Anointed One, Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our precious friend and companion in this work.</verse>
				<verse number="2">To the church that meets in his house, along with our dear sister Apphia and our fellow soldier Archippus.</verse>
				<verse number="3">May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ pour out his grace and peace upon you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I am always thankful to my God as I remember you in my prayers</verse>
				<verse number="5">because I’m hearing reports about your faith in the Lord Jesus and how much love you have for all his holy followers.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I pray for you that the faith we share may effectively deepen your understanding of every good thing that belongs to you in Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Your love has impacted me and brings me great joy and encouragement, for the hearts of the believers have been greatly refreshed through you, dear brother.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Even though I have enough boldness in Christ that I could command you to do what is proper,</verse>
				<verse number="9">I’d much rather make an appeal because of our friendship. So here I am, an old man, a prisoner for Christ, making my loving appeal to you. It is on behalf of my child, whose spiritual father I became while here in prison; that is, Onesimus.</verse>
				<verse number="10"></verse>
				<verse number="11">Formerly he was not useful or valuable to you, but now he is valuable to both of us.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He is my very heart, and I’ve sent him back to you with this letter.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I would have preferred to keep him at my side so that he could take your place as my helper during my imprisonment for the sake of the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="14">However, I did not want to make this decision without your consent, so that your act of kindness would not be a matter of obligation but out of willingness.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Perhaps you could think of it this way: he was separated from you for a short time so that you could have him back forever.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So welcome him no longer as a slave, but more than that, as a dearly loved brother. He is that to me especially, and how much more so to you, both humanly speaking and in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So if you consider me your friend and partner, accept him the same way you would accept me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And if he has stolen anything from you or owes you anything, just place it on my account.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I, Paul, have written these words in my own handwriting. I promise to pay you back everything, to say nothing of the fact that you owe me your very self.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yes, my brother, enrich my soul in the Lord—refresh my heart in Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="21">I’m writing to you with confidence that you will comply with my request and do even more than what I’m asking.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And would you do one more thing for me? Since I’m hoping through your prayers to be restored to you soon, please prepare a guest room for me.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in the Anointed One, Jesus, sends his greetings of peace to you,</verse>
				<verse number="24">and so does Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my companions in this ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="25">May the unconditional love of the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, be with your spirit!</verse>
			</chapter>
		</book>
		<book number="58">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">Throughout our history God has spoken to our ancestors by his prophets in many different ways. The revelation he gave them was only a fragment at a time, building one truth upon another.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But to us living in these last days, God now speaks to us openly in the language of a Son, the appointed Heir of everything, for through him God created the panorama of all things and all time.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The Son is the dazzling radiance of God’s splendor, the exact expression of God’s true nature—his mirror image! He holds the universe together and expands it by the mighty power of his spoken word. He accomplished for us the complete cleansing of sins, and then took his seat on the highest throne at the right hand of the majestic One.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He is infinitely greater than angels, for he inherited a rank and a Name far greater than theirs.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For God has never said to any angel what he said to Jesus: “You are my favored Son, today I have fathered you.” And this: “I will be the Father to him, and he will be the Son to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">And again, when he brought his firstborn Son into the world: “Let all my angels bow down before him and kiss him in worship.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">And about his angels he says, “I make my angels swift winds, and my ministers fiery flames.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But about his Son, he called him “God,” saying, “Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever and you will rule your kingdom with justice and righteousness,</verse>
				<verse number="9">For you have cherished righteousness and detested lawlessness. For this reason, God, your God, has anointed you and poured out the oil of bliss on you more than on any of your friends.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">And he called him Lord, saying, “Lord, you formed the earth in the beginning and with your own hands you crafted the cosmos.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They will both one day disappear, but you will remain forever! They will all fade like a worn-out garment,</verse>
				<verse number="12">And they will be changed like clothes, and you will fold them up and put them away. But you are ‘I AM.’ You never change, years without end!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">And God has never said this to any of his angels: “Take your seat next to me at my right hand until I force your whispering enemies to be a rug under your feet.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">What role then, do the angels have? The angels are spirit-messengers sent by God to serve those who are going to be saved.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">This is why it is so crucial that we be all the more engaged and attentive to the truths that we have heard so that we do not drift off course.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For if the message of the law spoken and confirmed by angels brought a just penalty to every disobedient violation;</verse>
				<verse number="3">then how would we expect to escape punishment if we despise the very truths that give us life? The Lord himself was the first to announce these things, and those who heard him firsthand confirmed their accuracy.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then God added his witness to theirs. He validated their ministry with signs, astonishing wonders, all kinds of powerful miracles, and by the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which he distributed as he desired.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For God will not place the coming world, of which we speak, under the government of angels.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But the Scriptures affirm: What is man that you would even think about him, or care about Adam’s race.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You made him lower than the angels for a little while. You placed your glory and honor upon his head as a crown. And you have given him dominion over the works of your hands,</verse>
				<verse number="8">For you have placed everything under his authority. This means that God has left nothing outside the control of his Son, even if presently we have yet to see this accomplished.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But we see Jesus, who as a man, lived for a short time lower than the angels and has now been crowned with glorious honor because of what he suffered in his death. For it was by God’s grace that he experienced death’s bitterness on behalf of everyone!</verse>
				<verse number="10">For now he towers above all creation, for all things exist through him and for him. And that God made him, pioneer of our salvation, perfect through his sufferings, for this is how he brings many sons and daughters to share in his glory.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Jesus, the Holy One, makes us holy. And as sons and daughters, we now belong to his same Father, so he is not ashamed or embarrassed to introduce us as his brothers and sisters!</verse>
				<verse number="12">For he has said, “I will reveal who you really are to my brothers and sisters, and I will glorify you with praises in the midst of the congregation.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">And, “My confidence rests in God!” And again he says, “Here I am, one with the children Yahweh has given me.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Since all his “children” have flesh and blood, so Jesus became human to fully identify with us. He did this, so that he could experience death and annihilate the effects of the intimidating accuser who holds against us the power of death.</verse>
				<verse number="15">By embracing death Jesus sets free those who live their entire lives in bondage to the tormenting dread of death.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For it is clear that he didn’t do this for the angels, but for all the sons and daughters of Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="17">This is why he had to be a man and take hold of our humanity in every way. He made us his brothers and sisters and became our merciful and faithful King-Priest before God; as the One who removed our sins to make us one with him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He suffered and endured every test and temptation, so that he can help us every time we pass through the ordeals of life.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">And so, dear brothers and sisters, you are now made holy, and each of you is invited to the feast of your heavenly calling. So fasten your thoughts fully onto Jesus, whom we embrace as our Apostle and King-Priest.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For he was faithful to the Father who appointed him, in the same way that Moses was a model of faithfulness in what was entrusted to him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But Jesus is worthy to receive a much greater glory than Moses, for the one who builds a house deserves to be honored more than the house he builds.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Every house is built by someone, but God is the Designer and Builder of all things.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Indeed, Moses served God faithfully in all he gave him to do. His work prophetically illustrates things that would later be spoken and fulfilled.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But Christ is more than a Servant, he was faithful as the Son in charge of God’s house. And now we are part of his house if we continue courageously to hold firmly to our bold confidence and our victorious hope.</verse>
				<verse number="7">This is why the Holy Spirit says, “If only you would listen to his voice this day!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Don’t make him angry by hardening your hearts, like your ancestors did during the days of their rebellion, when they were tested in the wilderness.</verse>
				<verse number="9">There your fathers tested me and tried my patience even though they saw my miracles for forty years they still doubted me!</verse>
				<verse number="10">This ignited my anger with that generation and I said about them, ‘They wander in their hearts just like they do with their feet, and they refuse to learn my ways.’</verse>
				<verse number="11">My heart grieved over them so I decreed: ‘They will not enter into my rest!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="12">So search your hearts every day, my brothers and sisters, and make sure that none of you has evil or unbelief hiding within you. For it will lead you astray, and make you unresponsive to the living God.</verse>
				<verse number="13">This is the time to encourage each other to never be stubborn or hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For we are mingled with the Messiah, if we will continue unshaken in this confident assurance from the beginning until the end.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For again, the Scriptures say, If only today you would listen to his voice. Don’t make him angry by hardening your hearts, as you did in the wilderness rebellion.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The same people who were delivered from bondage and brought out of Egypt by Moses, were the ones who heard and still rebelled.</verse>
				<verse number="17">They grieved God for forty years by sinning in their unbelief, until they dropped dead in the desert.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So God swore an oath that they would never enter into his calming place of rest all because they disobeyed him.</verse>
				<verse number="19">It is clear that they could not enter into their inheritance because they wrapped their hearts in unbelief.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Now the promise of entering into God’s rest is still for us today. So we must be extremely careful to ensure that we all embrace the fullness of that promise and not fail to experience it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For we have heard the good news of deliverance just as they did, yet they didn’t join their faith with the Word. Instead, what they heard didn’t affect them deeply, for they doubted.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For those of us who believe, faith activates the promise and we experience the realm of confident rest! For he has said, “I was grieved with them and made a solemn oath, ‘They will not enter into my rest.’ ” God’s works have all been completed from the foundation of the world,</verse>
				<verse number="4">for it says in the Scriptures, And on the seventh day God rested from all his works.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And again, as stated before, They will not enter into my rest.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Those who first heard the good news of deliverance failed to enter into that realm of faith’s rest because of their unbelieving hearts. Yet the fact remains that we still have the opportunity to enter into the faith-rest life and experience the fulfillment of the promise!</verse>
				<verse number="7">For God still has ordained a day for us to enter into called “Today.” For it was long afterwards that God repeated it in David’s words, “If only today you would listen to his voice and do not harden your hearts!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now if this promise of “rest” was fulfilled when Joshua brought the people into the land, God wouldn’t have spoken later of another “rest” yet to come.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So we conclude that there is still a full and complete Sabbath-rest waiting for believers to experience.</verse>
				<verse number="10">As we enter into God’s faith-rest life we cease from our own works, just as God celebrates his finished works and rests in them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So then we must be eager to experience this faith-rest life, so that no one falls short by following the same pattern of doubt and unbelief.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For we have the living Word of God, which is full of energy, like a two-mouthed sword. It will even penetrate to the very core of our being where soul and spirit, bone and marrow meet! It interprets and reveals the true thoughts and secret motives of our hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="13">There is not one person who can hide their thoughts from God, for nothing that we do remains a secret, and nothing created is concealed, but everything is exposed and defenseless before his eyes, to whom we must render an account.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So then, we must cling in faith to all we know to be true. For we have a magnificent King-Priest, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who rose into the heavenly realm for us, and now sympathizes with us in our frailty.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He understands humanity, for as a man, our magnificent King-Priest was tempted in every way just as we are, and conquered sin.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So now we draw near freely and boldly to where grace is enthroned, to receive mercy’s kiss and discover the grace we urgently need to strengthen us in our time of weakness.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">For every High Priest was chosen from among the people and appointed to represent them before God by presenting their gifts to God and offering sacrifices on their behalf.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Since the High Priest is also one who is clothed in weakness, he humbles himself by showing compassion to those who are ignorant of God’s ways and stray from them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And for this reason, he has to not only present the sin offerings of others, but also to bring a sin offering for himself.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And no one takes this honor upon himself by being self-appointed, but God is the one who calls each one, just as Aaron was called.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So also, Christ was not self-appointed and did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but God called and glorified him! For the Father said to him, “You are my favored Son. Today I have fathered you.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">And in another Scripture he says about this new priestly order, “You are a Priest like Melchizedek, a King-Priest forever!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">During Christ’s days on earth he pleaded with God, praying with passion and with tearful agony that God would spare him from death. And because of his perfect devotion his prayer was answered and he was delivered.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But even though he was a wonderful Son, he learned to listen and obey through all his sufferings.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And after being proven perfect in this way he has now become the source of eternal salvation to all those who listen to him and obey.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For God has designated him as the King-Priest who is over the priestly order of Melchizedek.</verse>
				<verse number="11">We have much to say about this topic although it is difficult to explain, because you have become too dull and sluggish to understand.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For you should already be professors instructing others by now; but instead, you need to be taught from the beginning the basics of God’s prophetic oracles! You’re like children still needing milk and not yet ready to digest solid food.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For every spiritual infant who lives on milk is not yet pierced by the revelation of righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But solid food is for the mature, whose spiritual senses perceive heavenly matters. And they have been adequately trained by what they’ve experienced to emerge with understanding of the difference between what is truly excellent and what is evil and harmful.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Now is the time for us to progress beyond the basic message of Christ and advance into perfection. The foundation has already been laid for us to build upon: turning away from our dead works to embrace faith in God,</verse>
				<verse number="2">teaching about different baptisms, impartation by the laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So with God’s enablement we will move on to deeper truths.</verse>
				<verse number="4">It is impossible to restore an apostate. For once a person has come into God’s light, and tasted the gifts of the heavenly realm, and has received the Holy Spirit,</verse>
				<verse number="5">and feasted on the good Word of God, and has entered into the power of the age that is breaking in,</verse>
				<verse number="6">if he abandons his faith, there is no use even trying to lead him to repentance. By their sin of apostasy they re-crucify the Son of God, and have publicly repudiated him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For men’s hearts are just like the soil that drinks up the showers which often fall upon it. Some soil will yield crops as God’s blessing upon the field.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But if the field continues to produce only thorns and thistles a curse hangs over it and it will be burned.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Even though we speak like this, beloved, we are fully convinced that there are more beautiful and excellent things, which flow from your salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For God, the Faithful One, is not unfair. How can he forget the beautiful work you have done for him? He remembers the love you demonstrate as you continually serve his beloved ones for the glory of his name.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But we long to see you passionately advance until the end and you find your hope fulfilled.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So don’t allow your hearts to grow dull or lose your enthusiasm, but follow the example of those who fully received what God has promised because of their strong faith and patient endurance.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now when God made a promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater than himself, he swore an oath on his own integrity to keep the promise as sure as God exists!</verse>
				<verse number="14">So he said, “Have no doubt, I promise to bless you over and over, and give you a son and multiply you without measure!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So Abraham waited patiently in faith and succeeded in seeing the promise fulfilled.</verse>
				<verse number="16">It is very common for people to swear an oath by something greater than themselves, for the oath will confirm their statements and end all dispute.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So in the same way, God wanted to end all doubt and confirm it even more forcefully to those who would inherit his promises. His purpose was unchangeable, so God added his vow to the promise.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So it is impossible for God to lie for we know that his promise and his vow will never change! And now we have run into his heart to hide ourselves in his faithfulness. This is where we find his strength and comfort, for he empowers us to seize what has already been established ahead of time—an unshakable hope!</verse>
				<verse number="19">We have this certain hope like a strong, unbreakable anchor holding our souls to God himself. Our anchor of hope is fastened to the mercy seat in the heavenly realm beyond the sacred threshold,</verse>
				<verse number="20">and where Jesus, our forerunner, has gone in before us. He is now and forever our royal Priest like Melchizedek.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Melchizedek’s name means “king of righteousness.” He was the King of Peace, because the name of the city he ruled as king was Salem, which means “peace.” And he was also a priest of the Most High God. Now when Abraham was returning from defeating many kings in battle, Melchizedek went out to meet him and blessed him. Then Abraham took a tenth of everything he had won in battle and gave it to Melchizedek.</verse>
				<verse number="2"></verse>
				<verse number="3">This Melchizedek has no father or mother, and no record of any of his ancestors. He was never born and he never died, but his life is like a picture of the Son of God, a King-Priest forever!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now let me show you proof of how great this Melchizedek is: – Even though Abraham was the most honored and favored patriarch of all God’s chosen ones, he gave a tithe of the spoils of battle to Melchizedek.</verse>
				<verse number="5">It would be understandable if Melchizedek had been a Jewish priest, for later on God’s people were required by law to support their priests financially, because the priests were their relatives and Abraham’s descendants.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But Melchizedek was not Abraham’s Jewish relative, and yet Abraham still paid him a tithe. – Melchizedek imparted a blessing on mighty Abraham, who had received the promises of God.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And no one could deny the fact that the one who has the power to impart a blessing is superior to the one who receives it. –</verse>
				<verse number="8">Although the Jewish priests received tithes, they all died—they were mortal. But Melchizedek lives on! –</verse>
				<verse number="9">It could even be said that Levi, the ancestor of every Jewish priest who received tithes, actually paid tithes to Melchizedek through Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For although Levi was yet unborn, the seed from which Levi came was present in Abraham when he paid his tithe to Melchizedek. –</verse>
				<verse number="11">If any of the Levitical priests who served under the law had the power to bring us into perfection, then why did God send Christ as Priest after the likeness of Melchizedek? He should have said, “After the likeness of Aaron.” –</verse>
				<verse number="12">And furthermore, for God to send a new and different rank of priest, meant a new law would have had to be instituted even to allow it!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yet the One these things all point to, was from a different tribe and no one from that tribe ever officiated at God’s altar,</verse>
				<verse number="14">for we all know that our Lord didn’t descend from the tribe of Levi, but shined from the tribe of Judah. And Moses himself never said anything of a priest in connection with Judah’s tribe.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And all this is made even clearer if there was another King-Priest raised up with the rank of Melchizedek.</verse>
				<verse number="16">This King-Priest did not arise because of a genealogical right under the law to be a priest, but by the power of an indestructible, resurrection life!</verse>
				<verse number="17">For it says in the Psalms, You are like Melchizedek, a King-Priest forever!</verse>
				<verse number="18">The old order of priesthood has been set aside as weak and powerless.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For the law has never made anyone perfect, but in its place is a far better hope which gives us confidence to experience intimacy with God!</verse>
				<verse number="20">And he confirmed it to us with his solemn vow. For the former priests took their office without an oath,</verse>
				<verse number="21">but with Jesus, God affirmed his royal-priesthood with his promise, saying, The Lord has made a solemn oath and will never change his mind, “You are a King-Priest forever!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">So all of this magnifies the truth that we have a superior covenant with God than what they experienced, for Jesus himself is its guarantor!</verse>
				<verse number="23">As additional proof, we know there were many priests under the old system, for they eventually died and their office had to be filled by another.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But Jesus permanently holds his priestly office, since he lives forever and will never have a successor!</verse>
				<verse number="25">So he is able to save fully from now throughout eternity, everyone who comes to God through him, because he lives to pray continually for them.</verse>
				<verse number="26">He is the High Priest who perfectly fits our need—holy, without a trace of evil, without the ability to deceive, incapable of sin, and exalted beyond the heavens!</verse>
				<verse number="27">Unlike the former high priests, he is not compelled to offer daily sacrifices. They had to bring a sacrifice first for their own sins, then for the sins of the people, but he finished the sacrificial system, once and for all, when he offered himself.</verse>
				<verse number="28">The law appointed flawed men as high priests, but God’s promise, sealed with his oath, which succeeded the law, appoints a perfect Son who is complete forever!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Now this is the crowning point of what we are saying: We have a magnificent King-Priest who ministers for us at the right hand of God. He is enthroned with honor next to the throne of the Majesty on high.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He serves in the holy sanctuary in the true heavenly tabernacle set up by God, and not by men.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Since every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, so the Messiah also had to bring some sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But since he didn’t qualify to be an earthly priest, and there are already priests who offer sacrifices prescribed by the law, he offered in heaven a perfect sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The priests on earth serve in a temple that is but a copy modeled after the heavenly sanctuary; a shadow of the reality. For when Moses began to construct the tabernacle God warned him and said, “You must precisely follow the pattern I revealed to you on Mount Sinai.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">But now Jesus the Messiah has accepted a priestly ministry which far surpasses theirs, since he is the catalyst of a better covenant which contains far more wonderful promises!</verse>
				<verse number="7">For if that first covenant had been faultless no one would have needed a second one to replace it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But God revealed the defect and limitation of the first when he said to his people, “Look! The day will come, declares the Lord, when I will satisfy the people of Israel and Judah by giving them a new covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="9">It will be an entirely different covenant than the one I made with their fathers when I led them by my hand out of Egypt. For they did not remain faithful to my covenant, so I rejected them, says the Lord God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For here is the covenant I will one day establish with the people of Israel: I will embed my laws within their thoughts and fasten them onto their hearts. I will be their loyal God and they will be my loyal people.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And the result of this will be that everyone will know me as Lord! There will be no need at all to teach their fellow-citizens or brothers by saying, ‘You should know Yahweh,’ since everyone will know me inwardly, from the most unlikely to the most distinguished.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For I will demonstrate my mercy to them and will forgive their evil deeds, and never remember again their sins.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">This proves that by establishing this new covenant the first is now obsolete, ready to expire, and about to disappear.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Now in the first covenant there were specific rules for worship including a sanctuary on earth to worship in.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When you entered the tabernacle you would first come into the holy chamber where you would find the lampstand and the bread of his presence on the fellowship table.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then as you pass through the next curtain you would enter the innermost chamber called, the holiest sanctuary of all.</verse>
				<verse number="4">It contained the golden altar of incense and the ark of covenant mercy, which was a wooden box covered entirely with gold. And placed inside the ark of covenant mercy was the golden jar with mystery-manna inside, Aaron’s resurrection rod, which had sprouted, and the stone tablets engraved with the covenant laws.</verse>
				<verse number="5">On top of the lid of the ark were two cherubim, angels of splendor, with outstretched wings overshadowing the throne of mercy. But now is not the time to discuss further the significant details of these things.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So with this prescribed pattern of worship the priests would routinely go in and out of the first chamber to perform their religious duties.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And the high priest was permitted to enter into the Holiest Sanctuary of All only once a year and he could never enter without first offering sacrificial blood for both his own sins and for the sins of the people.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now the Holy Spirit uses the symbols of this pattern of worship to reveal that the perfect way of holiness had not yet been unveiled. For as long as the tabernacle stood</verse>
				<verse number="9">it was an illustration that pointed to our present time of fulfillment, demonstrating that offerings and animal sacrifices had failed to perfectly cleanse the conscience of the worshiper.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For this old pattern of worship was a matter of external rules and rituals concerning food and drink and ceremonial washings which was imposed upon us until the appointed time of heart-restoration had arrived.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But now the Anointed One has become the King-Priest of every wonderful thing that has come. For he serves in a greater, more perfect heavenly tabernacle not made by men, that is to say, not a part of this creation.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And he has entered once and forever into the Holiest Sanctuary of All, not with the blood of animal sacrifices, but the sacred blood of his own sacrifice. And he alone has made our salvation secure forever!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Under the old covenant the blood of bulls, goats, and the ashes of a heifer were sprinkled on those who were defiled and effectively cleansed them outwardly from their ceremonial impurities.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yet how much more will the sacred blood of the Messiah thoroughly cleanse our consciences! For by the power of the eternal Spirit he has offered himself to God as the perfect Sacrifice that now frees us from our dead works to worship and serve the living God.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So Jesus is the One who has enacted a new covenant with a new relationship with God so that those who accept the invitation will receive the eternal inheritance he has promised to his heirs. For he died to release us from the guilt of the violations committed under the first covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now a person’s last will and testament can only take effect after one has been proven to have died; otherwise the will cannot be in force while the person who made it is still alive.</verse>
				<verse number="17"></verse>
				<verse number="18">So this is why not even the first covenant was inaugurated without the blood of animals.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For Moses ratified the covenant after he gave the people all the commandments of the law. He took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a hyssop branch, and sprinkled both the people and the book of the covenant,</verse>
				<verse number="20">saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God commands you to keep.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">And later Moses also sprinkled the tabernacle with blood and every utensil and item used in their service of worship.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Actually, nearly everything under the law was purified with blood, since forgiveness only comes through an outpouring of blood.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And so it was necessary for all the earthly symbols of the heavenly realities to be purified with these animal sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves required a superior sacrifice than these.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For the Messiah did not enter into the earthly tabernacle made by men, which was but an echo of the true sanctuary, but he entered into heaven itself to appear before the face of God in our place.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Under the old system year after year the high priest entered the most holy sanctuary with blood that was not his own. But the Messiah did not need to repeatedly offer himself year after year,</verse>
				<verse number="26">for that would mean he must suffer repeatedly ever since the fall of the world. But now he has appeared at the fulfillment of the ages to abolish sin once and for all by the sacrifice of himself!</verse>
				<verse number="27">Every human being is appointed to die once, and then to face God’s judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But when we die we will be face-to-face with Christ, the One who experienced death once for all to bear the sins of many! And now to those who eagerly await him, he will appear a second time; not to deal with sin, but to bring us the fullness of salvation.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">The old system of living under the law presented us with only a faint shadow, a crude outline of the reality of the wonderful blessings to come. Even with its steady stream of sacrifices offered year after year, there still was nothing that could make our hearts perfect before God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For if animal sacrifices could once and for all eliminate sin, they would have ceased to be offered and the worshipers would have clean consciences. Instead, once was not enough so by the repetitive sacrifices year after year, the worshipers were continually reminded of their sins, with their hearts still impure.</verse>
				<verse number="3"></verse>
				<verse number="4">For what power does the blood of bulls and goats have to remove sin’s guilt?</verse>
				<verse number="5">So when Jesus the Messiah came into the world he said, “Since your ultimate desire was not another animal sacrifice, you have clothed me with a body that I might offer myself instead!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Multiple burnt offerings and sin-offerings cannot satisfy your justice.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So I said to you, ‘God— I will be the One to go and do your will, to fulfill all that is written of me in your Word!’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="8">First he said, “Multiple burnt-offerings and sin-offerings cannot satisfy your justice” (even though the law required them to be offered).</verse>
				<verse number="9">And then he said, “God, I will be the One to go and do your will.” So by being the sacrifice that removes sin, he abolishes animal sacrifices and replaces that entire system with the new covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="10">By God’s will we have been purified and made holy once and for all through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus, the Messiah!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yet every day priests still serve, ritually offering the same sacrifices again and again—sacrifices that can never take away sin’s guilt.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But when this Priest had offered the one supreme sacrifice for sin for all time he sat down on a throne at the right hand of God,</verse>
				<verse number="13">waiting until all his whispering enemies are subdued and turn into his footstool.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And by his one perfect sacrifice he made us perfectly holy and complete for all time!</verse>
				<verse number="15">The Holy Spirit confirms this to us by this Scripture, for the Lord says,</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Afterwards, I will give them this covenant: I will embed my laws into their hearts and fasten my Word to their thoughts.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">And then he says, “I will not ever again remember their sins and lawless deeds!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">So if our sins have been forgiven and forgotten, why would we ever need to offer another sacrifice for sin?</verse>
				<verse number="19">And now we are brothers and sisters in God’s family because of the blood of Jesus, and he welcomes us to come into the most holy sanctuary in the heavenly realm—boldly and without hesitation.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For he has dedicated a new, life-giving way for us to approach God. For just as the veil was torn in two, Jesus’ body was torn open to give us free and fresh access to him!</verse>
				<verse number="21">And since we now have a magnificent High Priest to welcome us into God’s house,</verse>
				<verse number="22">we come closer to God and approach him with an open heart, fully convinced that nothing will keep us at a distance from him. For our hearts have been sprinkled with blood to remove impurity, and we have been freed from an accusing conscience. Now we are clean, unstained, and presentable to God inside and out!</verse>
				<verse number="23">So now wrap your heart tightly around the hope that lives within us, knowing that God always keeps his promises!</verse>
				<verse number="24">Discover creative ways to encourage others and to motivate them toward acts of compassion, doing beautiful works as expressions of love.</verse>
				<verse number="25">This is not the time to pull away and neglect meeting together, as some have formed the habit of doing. In fact, we should come together even more frequently, eager to encourage and urge each other onward as we anticipate that day dawning.</verse>
				<verse number="26">For if we continue to persist in deliberate sin after we have known and received the truth, there is not another sacrifice for sin to be made for us.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But this would qualify one for the certain, terrifying expectation of judgment and the raging fire ready to burn up his enemies!</verse>
				<verse number="28">Anyone who disobeyed Moses’ law died without mercy on the simple evidence of two or three witnesses.</verse>
				<verse number="29">How much more severely do you suppose a person deserves to be judged who has contempt for God’s Son, and who scorns the blood of the new covenant that made him holy, and has outraged the Spirit of grace?</verse>
				<verse number="30">For we know him who said, “I have the right to take revenge and pay them back for their evil!” And also, “The Lord God will judge his own people!”</verse>
				<verse number="31">It is the most terrifying thing of all to come under the judgment of the Living God!</verse>
				<verse number="32">Don’t you remember those days right after the Light shined in your hearts? You endured a great marathon season of suffering hardships, yet you stood your ground.</verse>
				<verse number="33">And at times you were publicly and shamefully mistreated, being persecuted for your faith; then at other times you stood side by side with those who preach the message of hope.</verse>
				<verse number="34">You sympathized with those in prison and when all your belongings were confiscated you accepted that violation with joy; convinced that you possess a treasure growing in heaven that could never be taken from you.</verse>
				<verse number="35">So don’t lose your bold, courageous faith, for you are destined for a great reward!</verse>
				<verse number="36">You need the strength of endurance to reveal the poetry of God’s will and then you receive the promise in full.</verse>
				<verse number="37">For soon and very soon, “The One who is appearing will come without delay!”</verse>
				<verse number="38">And he also says, “My righteous ones will live from my faith. But if fear holds them back, my soul is not content with them!”</verse>
				<verse number="39">But we are certainly not those who are held back by fear and perish; we are among those who have faith and experience true life!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Now faith brings our hopes into reality and becomes the foundation needed to acquire the things we long for. It is all the evidence required to prove what is still unseen.</verse>
				<verse number="2">This testimony of faith is what previous generations were commended for.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Faith empowers us to see that the universe was created and beautifully coordinated by the power of God’s words! He spoke and the invisible realm gave birth to all that is seen.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Faith moved Abel to choose a more acceptable sacrifice to offer God than his brother Cain, and God declared him righteous because of his offering of faith. By his faith, Abel still speaks instruction to us today, even though he is long dead.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Faith translated Enoch from this life and he was taken up into heaven! He never had to experience death; he just disappeared from this world because God promoted him. For before he was translated to the heavenly realm his life had become a pleasure to God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And without faith living within us it would be impossible to please God. For we come to God in faith knowing that he is real and that he rewards the faith of those who passionately seek him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Faith opened Noah’s heart to receive revelation and warnings from God about what was coming, even things that had never been seen. But he stepped out in reverent obedience to God and built an ark that would save him and his family. By his faith the world was condemned, but Noah received God’s gift of righteousness that comes by believing.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Faith motivated Abraham to obey God’s call and leave the familiar to discover the territory he was destined to inherit from God. So he left with only a promise and without even knowing ahead of time where he was going, Abraham stepped out in faith.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He lived by faith as an immigrant in his promised land as though it belonged to someone else. He journeyed through the land living in tents with Isaac and Jacob who were persuaded that they were also co-heirs of the same promise.</verse>
				<verse number="10">His eyes of faith were set on the city with unshakable foundations, whose architect and builder is God himself.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Sarah’s faith embraced God’s miracle power to conceive even though she was barren and was past the age of childbearing, for the authority of her faith rested in the One who made the promise, and she tapped into his faithfulness.</verse>
				<verse number="12">In fact, so many children were subsequently fathered by this aged man of faith—one who was as good as dead, that he now has offspring as innumerable as the sand on the seashore and as the stars in the sky!</verse>
				<verse number="13">These heroes all died still clinging to their faith, not even receiving all that had been promised them. But they saw beyond the horizon the fulfillment of their promises and gladly embraced it from afar. They all lived their lives on earth as those who belonged to another realm.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For clearly, those who live this way are longing for the appearing of a heavenly city.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And if their hearts were still remembering what they left behind, they would have found an opportunity to go back.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But they couldn’t turn back for their hearts were fixed on what was far greater, that is, the heavenly realm! So because of this God is not ashamed in any way to be called their God, for he has prepared a heavenly city for them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Faith operated powerfully in Abraham for when he was put to the test he offered up Isaac. Even though he received God’s promises of descendants, he was willing to offer up his only son!</verse>
				<verse number="18">For God had promised, “Through your son Isaac your lineage will carry on your name.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Abraham’s faith made it logical to him that God could raise Isaac from the dead, and symbolically, that’s exactly what happened.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The power of faith prompted Isaac to impart a blessing to his sons, Jacob and Esau, concerning their prophetic destinies.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jacob worshiped in faith’s reality at the end of his life, and leaning upon his staff he imparted a prophetic blessing upon each of Joseph’s sons.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Faith inspired Joseph and opened his eyes to see into the future, for as he was dying he prophesied about the exodus of Israel out of Egypt, and gave instructions that his bones were to be taken from Egypt with them.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Faith prompted the parents of Moses at his birth to hide him for three months, because they realized their child was exceptional and they refused to be afraid of the king’s edict.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Faith enabled Moses to choose God’s will, for although he was raised as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, he refused to make that his identity,</verse>
				<verse number="25">choosing instead to suffer mistreatment with the people of God. Moses preferred faith’s certainty above the momentary enjoyment of sin’s pleasures.</verse>
				<verse number="26">He found his true wealth in suffering abuse for being anointed, more than in anything the world could offer him, for his eyes looked with wonder not on the immediate, but on the ultimate—faith’s great reward!</verse>
				<verse number="27">Holding faith’s promise Moses abandoned Egypt and had no fear of Pharaoh’s rage because he persisted in faith as if he had seen God who is unseen.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Faith stirred Moses to perform the rite of Passover and sprinkle lamb’s blood, to prevent the destroyer from harming their firstborn.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Faith opened the way for the Hebrews to cross the Red Sea as if on dry land, but when the Egyptians tried to cross they were swallowed up and drowned!</verse>
				<verse number="30">Faith pulled down Jericho’s walls after the people marched around them for seven days!</verse>
				<verse number="31">Faith provided a way of escape for Rahab the prostitute, avoiding the destruction of the unbelievers, because she received the Hebrew spies in peace.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And what more could I say to convince you? For there is not enough time to tell you of the faith of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Through faith’s power they conquered kingdoms and established true justice. Their faith fastened onto their promises and pulled them into reality! It was faith that shut the mouth of lions,</verse>
				<verse number="34">put out the power of raging fire, and caused many to escape certain death by the sword. Although weak, their faith imparted power to make them strong! Faith sparked courage within them and they became mighty warriors in battle, pulling armies from another realm into battle array.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Faith-filled women saw their dead children raised in resurrection power. Yet it was faith that enabled others to endure great atrocities. They were stretched out on the wheel and tortured, and didn’t deny their faith in order to be freed, because they longed for a more honorable and glorious resurrection!</verse>
				<verse number="36">Others were mocked and experienced the most severe beating with whips; they were in chains and imprisoned.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Some of these faith champions were brutally killed by stoning, being sawn in two or slaughtered by the sword. These lived in faith as they went about wearing goatskins and sheepskins for clothing. They lost everything they possessed, they endured great afflictions, and they were cruelly mistreated.</verse>
				<verse number="38">They wandered the earth living in the desert wilderness, in caves, on barren mountains and in holes in the earth. Truly, the world was not even worthy of them, not realizing who they were.</verse>
				<verse number="39">These were the true heroes, commended for their faith, yet they lived in hope without receiving the fullness of what was promised them.</verse>
				<verse number="40">But now God has invited us to live in something better than what they had—faith’s fullness! This is so that they could be brought to finished perfection alongside of us.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">As for us, we have all of these great witnesses who encircle us like clouds. So we must let go of every wound that has pierced us and the sin we so easily fall into. Then we will be able to run life’s marathon race with passion and determination, for the path has been already marked out before us.</verse>
				<verse number="2">We look away from the natural realm and we focus our attention and expectation onto Jesus who birthed faith within us and who leads us forward into faith’s perfection. His example is this: Because his heart was focused on the joy of knowing that you would be his, he endured the agony of the cross and conquered its humiliation, and now sits exalted at the right hand of the throne of God!</verse>
				<verse number="3">So consider carefully how Jesus faced such intense opposition from sinners who opposed their own souls, so that you won’t become worn down and cave in under life’s pressures.</verse>
				<verse number="4">After all, you have not yet reached the point of sweating blood in your opposition to sin.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And have you forgotten his encouraging words spoken to you as his children? He said, “My child, don’t underestimate the value of the discipline and training of the Lord God, or get depressed when he has to correct you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For the Lord’s training of your life is the evidence of his faithful love. And when he draws you to himself, it proves you are his delightful child.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Fully embrace God’s correction as part of your training, for he is doing what any loving father does for his children. For who has ever heard of a child who never had to be corrected?</verse>
				<verse number="8">We all should welcome God’s discipline as the validation of authentic sonship. For if we have never once endured his correction it only proves we are strangers and not sons.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And isn’t it true that we respect our earthly fathers even though they corrected and disciplined us? Then we should demonstrate an even greater respect for God, our spiritual Father, as we submit to his life-giving discipline.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Our parents corrected us for the short time of our childhood as it seemed good to them. But God corrects us throughout our lives for our own good, giving us an invitation to share his holiness.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now all discipline seems to be painful at the time, yet later it will produce a transformation of character, bringing a harvest of righteousness and peace to those who yield to it.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So be made strong even in your weakness by lifting up your tired hands in prayer and worship. And strengthen your weak knees,</verse>
				<verse number="13">for as you keep walking forward on God’s paths all your stumbling ways will be divinely healed!</verse>
				<verse number="14">In every relationship be swift to choose peace over competition, and run swiftly toward holiness, for those who are not holy will not see the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Watch over each other to make sure that no one misses the revelation of God’s grace. And make sure no one lives with a root of bitterness sprouting within them which will only cause trouble and poison the hearts of many.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Be careful that no one among you lives in immorality, becoming careless about God’s blessings, like Esau who traded away his rights as the firstborn for a simple meal.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And we know that later on when he wanted to inherit his father’s blessing, he was turned away, even though he begged for it with bitter tears, for it was too late then to repent.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For we are not coming, as Moses did, to a physical mountain with its burning fire, thick clouds of darkness and gloom, and with a raging whirlwind.</verse>
				<verse number="19">We are not those who are being warned by the jarring blast of a trumpet and the thundering voice; the fearful voice that they begged to be silenced.</verse>
				<verse number="20">They couldn’t handle God’s command that said, “If so much as an animal approaches the mountain it is to be stoned to death!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">The astounding phenomena Moses witnessed caused him to shudder with fear and he could only say, “I am trembling in terror!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">By contrast, we have already come near to God in a totally different realm, the Zion-realm, for we have entered the city of the Living God, which is the New Jerusalem in heaven! We have joined the festal gathering of myriads of angels in their joyous celebration!</verse>
				<verse number="23">And as members of the church of the Firstborn all our names have been legally registered as citizens of heaven! And we have come before God who judges all, and who lives among the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect in his eyes!</verse>
				<verse number="24">And we have come to Jesus who established a new covenant with his blood sprinkled upon the mercy seat; blood that continues to speak from heaven, “forgiveness,” a better message than Abel’s blood that cries from the earth, “justice.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Make very sure that you never refuse to listen to God when he speaks! For the God who spoke on earth from Sinai is the same God who now speaks from heaven. Those who heard him speak his living Word on earth found nowhere to hide, so what chance is there for us to escape if we turn our backs on God and refuse to hear his warnings as he speaks from heaven?</verse>
				<verse number="26">The earth was rocked at the sound of his voice from the mountain, but now he has promised, “Once and for all I will not only shake the systems of the world, but also the unseen powers in the heavenly realm!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Now this phrase “once and for all” clearly indicates the final removal of things that are shaking, that is, the old order, so only what is unshakable will remain.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Since we are receiving our rights to an unshakable kingdom we should be extremely thankful and offer God the purest worship that delights his heart as we lay down our lives in absolute surrender, filled with awe.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For our God is a holy, devouring fire!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">No matter what, make room in your heart to love every believer.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And show hospitality to strangers, for they may be angels from God showing up as your guests.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Identify with those who are in prison as though you were there suffering with them, and those who are mistreated as if you could feel their pain.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Honor the sanctity of marriage and keep your vows of purity to one another, for God will judge sexual immorality in any form, whether single or married.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Don’t be obsessed with money but live content with what you have, for you always have God’s presence. For hasn’t he promised you, “I will never leave you, never! And I will not loosen my grip on your life!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So we can say with great confidence: “I know the Lord is for me and I will never be afraid of what people may do to me!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Don’t forget the example of your spiritual leaders who have spoken God’s messages to you, take a close look at how their lives ended, and then follow their walk of faith.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus, the Anointed One, is always the same—yesterday, today, and forever.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So don’t let anyone lead you astray with all sorts of novel and exotic teachings. It is more beautiful to feast on grace and be inwardly strengthened than to be obsessed with dietary rules which in themselves have no lasting benefit.</verse>
				<verse number="10">We feast on a sacrifice at our spiritual altar, but those who serve as priests in the old system of worship have no right to eat of it.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For the high priest carries the blood of animals into the holiest chamber as a sacrifice for sin, and then burns the bodies of the animals outside the city.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And Jesus, our sin-sacrifice, also suffered death outside the city walls to make us holy by his own blood.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So we must arise and join him outside the religious “walls” and bear his disgrace.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For we have no city here on earth to be our permanent home, but we seek the city that is destined to come.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So we no longer offer up a steady stream of blood sacrifices, but through Jesus, we will offer up to God a steady stream of praise sacrifices—these are “the lambs” we offer from our lips that celebrate his name!</verse>
				<verse number="16">We will show mercy to the poor and not miss an opportunity to do acts of kindness for others, for these are the true sacrifices that delight God’s heart.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Obey your spiritual leaders and recognize their authority, for they keep watch over your soul without resting since they will have to give an account to God for their work. So it will benefit you when you make their work a pleasure and not a heavy burden.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And keep praying for us that we continue to live with a clear conscience, for we desire to live honorably in all that we do.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And I especially ask you to pray that God would send me back to you very soon.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now may the God who brought us peace by raising from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ so that he would be the Great Shepherd of his flock; and by the power of the blood of the eternal covenant</verse>
				<verse number="21">may he work perfection into every part of you giving you all that you need to fulfill your destiny. And may he express through you all that is excellent and pleasing to him through your life-union with Jesus the Anointed One who is to receive all glory forever! Amen!</verse>
				<verse number="22">My dear brothers and sisters, I urge you to let your spirits flow through this message of love that I’ve written to you in these few words.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I want you to know that our brother Timothy is free again and as soon as he arrives here we’ll come together to see you. We extend our greetings to all your leaders and all the holy believers.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The Italian believers also send their greetings.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now may God’s wonderful grace be poured out upon you all! Amen!</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">Greetings! My name is Jacob, and I’m a love-slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. I’m writing to all the twelve tribes of Israel who have been sown as seeds among the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="2">My fellow believers, when it seems as though you are facing nothing but difficulties, see it as an invaluable opportunity to experience the greatest joy that you can!</verse>
				<verse number="3">For you know that when your faith is tested it stirs up in you the power of endurance.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And then as your endurance grows even stronger, it will release perfection into every part of your being until there is nothing missing and nothing lacking.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And if anyone longs to be wise, ask God for wisdom and he will give it! He won’t see your lack of wisdom as an opportunity to scold you over your failures but he will overwhelm your failures with his generous grace.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Just make sure you ask empowered by confident faith without doubting that you will receive. For the ambivalent person believes one minute and doubts the next. Being undecided makes you become like the rough seas driven and tossed by the wind. You’re up one minute and tossed down the next.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When you are half-hearted and wavering it leaves you unstable. Can you really expect to receive anything from the Lord when you’re in that condition?</verse>
				<verse number="8"></verse>
				<verse number="9">The believer who is poor still has reasons to boast, for he has been placed on high.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But those who are rich should boast in how God has brought them low and humbled them, for all their earthly glory will one day fade away like a wildflower in the meadow.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For as the scorching heat of the sun causes the petals of the wildflower to fall off and lose its appearance of beauty, so the rich in the midst of their pursuit of wealth will wither away.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If your faith remains strong, even while surrounded by life’s difficulties, you will continue to experience the untold blessings of God! True happiness comes as you pass the test with faith, and receive the victorious crown of life promised to every lover of God!</verse>
				<verse number="13">When you are tempted don’t ever say, “God is tempting me,” for God is incapable of being tempted by evil and he is never the source of temptation.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Instead it is each person’s own desires and thoughts that drag them into evil and lure them away into darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Evil desires give birth to evil actions. And when sin is fully mature it can murder you!</verse>
				<verse number="16">So my friends, don’t be fooled by your own desires!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Every gift God freely gives us is good and perfect, streaming down from the Father of lights, who shines from the heavens with no hidden shadow or darkness and is never subject to change.</verse>
				<verse number="18">God was delighted to give us birth by the truth of his infallible Word so that we would fulfill his chosen destiny for us and become the favorite ones out of all his creation!</verse>
				<verse number="19">My dearest brothers and sisters, take this to heart: Be quick to listen, but slow to speak. And be slow to become angry,</verse>
				<verse number="20">for human anger is never a legitimate tool to promote God’s righteous purpose.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So this is why we abandon everything morally impure and all forms of wicked conduct. Instead, with a sensitive spirit we absorb God’s Word, which has been implanted within our nature, for the Word of Life has power to continually deliver us.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Don’t just listen to the Word of Truth and not respond to it, for that is the essence of self-deception. So always let his Word become like poetry written and fulfilled by your life!</verse>
				<verse number="23">If you listen to the Word and don’t live out the message you hear, you become like the person who looks in the mirror of the Word to discover the reflection of his face in the beginning.</verse>
				<verse number="24">You perceive how God sees you in the mirror of the Word, but then you go out and forget your divine origin.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But those who set their gaze deeply into the perfecting law of liberty are fascinated by and respond to the truth they hear and are strengthened by it—they experience God’s blessing in all that they do!</verse>
				<verse number="26">If someone believes they have a relationship with God but fails to guard his words then his heart is drifting away and his religion is shallow and empty.</verse>
				<verse number="27">True spirituality that is pure in the eyes of our Father God is to make a difference in the lives of the orphans, and widows in their troubles, and to refuse to be corrupted by the world’s values.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">My dear brothers and sisters, fellow believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ—how could we say that we have faith in him and yet we favor one group of people above another?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Suppose an influential man comes into your worship meeting wearing gold rings and expensive clothing, and also a homeless man in shabby clothes comes in.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If you show special attention to the rich man in expensive clothes and say, “Here’s a seat of honor for you right up front!” but you turn and say to the poor beggar dressed in rags, “You can stand over here,” or “Sit over there on the floor in the back,”</verse>
				<verse number="4">then you’ve demonstrated gross prejudice among yourselves and used evil standards of judgment!</verse>
				<verse number="5">So listen carefully, my dear brothers and sisters, hasn’t God chosen the poor in the world’s eyes to be those who are rich in faith? And won’t they be the heirs of the kingdom-realm he promised to those who love him?</verse>
				<verse number="6">But yet you insult and shun the poor in your efforts to impress the rich! Isn’t it the wealthy who exploit you and drag you into court?</verse>
				<verse number="7">Aren’t they the very ones who blaspheme the beautiful name of the One you now belong to?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Your calling is to fulfill the royal law of love as given to us in this Scripture: “You must love and value your neighbor as you love and value yourself!” For keeping this law is the noble way to live.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But when you show prejudice you commit sin and you violate this royal law of love!</verse>
				<verse number="10">For the one who attempts to keep all of the law of Moses but fails in just one point has become guilty of breaking the law in every respect!</verse>
				<verse number="11">For the same One who tells us, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you don’t commit adultery but do commit murder, you are still guilty as a law-breaker.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So we must both speak and act in every respect like those who are destined to be tried by the perfect law of liberty,</verse>
				<verse number="13">and remember that judgment is merciless for the one who judges others without mercy. So by showing mercy, you take dominion over judgment!</verse>
				<verse number="14">My dear brothers and sisters, what good is it if someone claims to have faith but demonstrates no good works to prove it? How could this kind of faith save anyone?</verse>
				<verse number="15">For example, if a brother or sister in the faith is poorly clothed and hungry</verse>
				<verse number="16">and you leave them saying, “Good-bye. I hope you stay warm and have plenty to eat,” but you don’t provide them with a coat or even a cup of soup, what good is your faith?</verse>
				<verse number="17">So then faith that doesn’t involve action is phony.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But someone might object and say, “One person has faith and another person has works.” Go ahead then and prove to me that you have faith without works and I will show you faith by my works as proof that I believe.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You can believe all you want that there is one true God, that’s wonderful! But even the demons know this and tremble with fear before him, yet they’re unchanged— they remain demons.</verse>
				<verse number="20">O feeble sons of Adam, do you need further evidence that faith divorced from good works is phony?</verse>
				<verse number="21">Wasn’t our ancestor Abraham found righteous before God because of his works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?</verse>
				<verse number="22">Can’t you see how his action cooperated with his faith and by his action faith found its full expression?</verse>
				<verse number="23">So in this way the Scripture was fulfilled: Because Abraham believed God, his faith was exchanged for God’s righteousness. So he became known as the lover of God!</verse>
				<verse number="24">So now it’s clear that a person is seen as righteous in God’s eyes not merely by faith alone, but by his works.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And the same is true of the prostitute named Rahab who was found righteous in God’s eyes by her works, for she received the spies into her home and helped them escape from the city by another route.</verse>
				<verse number="26">For just as a human body without the spirit is a dead corpse, so faith without the expression of good works is dead!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">My dear brothers and sisters, don’t be so eager to become a teacher in the church since you know that we who teach are held to a higher standard of judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="2">We all fail in many areas, but especially with our words. Yet if we’re able to bridle the words we say we are powerful enough to control ourselves in every way, and that means our character is mature and fully developed.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Horses have bits and bridles in their mouths so that we can control and guide their large body.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And the same with mighty ships, though they are massive and driven by fierce winds, yet they are steered by a tiny rudder at the direction of the person at the helm.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And so the tongue is a small part of the body yet it carries great power! Just think of how a small flame can set a huge forest ablaze.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And the tongue is a fire! It can be compared to the sum total of wickedness and is the most dangerous part of our human body. It corrupts the entire body and is a hellish flame! It releases a fire that can burn throughout the course of human existence.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For every wild animal on earth including birds, creeping reptiles, and creatures of the sea and land have all been overpowered and tamed by humans,</verse>
				<verse number="8">but the tongue is not able to be tamed. It’s a fickle, unrestrained evil that spews out words full of toxic poison!</verse>
				<verse number="9">We use our tongue to praise God our Father and then turn around and curse a person who was made in his very image!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Out of the same mouth we pour out words of praise one minute and curses the next. My brothers and sisters, this should never be!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Would you look for olives hanging on a fig tree or go to pick figs from a grapevine? Is it possible that fresh and bitter water can flow out of the same spring? So neither can a bitter spring produce fresh water.</verse>
				<verse number="12"></verse>
				<verse number="13">If you consider yourself to be wise and one who understands the ways of God, advertise it with a beautiful, fruitful life guided by wisdom’s gentleness. Never brag or boast about what you’ve done and you’ll prove that you’re truly wise.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But if there is bitter jealousy or competition hiding in your heart, then don’t deny it and try to compensate for it by boasting and being phony.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For that has nothing to do with God’s heavenly wisdom but can best be described as the wisdom of this world, both selfish and devilish.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So wherever jealousy and selfishness are uncovered, you will also find many troubles and every kind of meanness.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But the wisdom from above is always pure, filled with peace, considerate and teachable. It is filled with love and never displays prejudice or hypocrisy in any form</verse>
				<verse number="18">and it always bears the beautiful harvest of righteousness! Good seeds of wisdom’s fruit will be planted with peaceful acts by those who cherish making peace.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">What is the cause of your conflicts and quarrels with each other? Doesn’t the battle begin inside of you as you fight to have your own way and fulfill your own desires?</verse>
				<verse number="2">You jealously want what others have so you begin to see yourself as better than others. You scheme with envy and harm others to selfishly obtain what you crave—that’s why you quarrel and fight. And all the time you don’t obtain what you want because you won’t ask God for it!</verse>
				<verse number="3">And if you ask, you won’t receive it for you’re asking with corrupt motives, seeking only to fulfill your own selfish desires.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You have become spiritual adulterers who are having an affair, an unholy relationship with the world. Don’t you know that flirting with the world’s values places you at odds with God? Whoever chooses to be the world’s friend makes himself God’s enemy!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Does the Scripture mean nothing to you that says, “The Spirit that God breathed into our hearts is a jealous Lover who intensely desires to have more and more of us”?</verse>
				<verse number="6">But he continues to pour out more and more grace upon us. For it says, “God resists you when you are proud but continually pours out grace when you are humble.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So then, surrender to God. Stand up to the devil and resist him and he will flee in agony.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Move your heart closer and closer to God, and he will come even closer to you. But make sure you cleanse your life, you sinners, and keep your heart pure and stop doubting.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Feel the pain of your sin, be sorrowful and weep! Let your joking around be turned into mourning and your joy into deep humiliation.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Be willing to be made low before the Lord and he will exalt you!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Dear friends, as part of God’s family, never speak against another family member, for when you slander a brother or sister you violate God’s law of love. And your duty is not to make yourself a judge of the law of love by saying that it doesn’t apply to you, but your duty is to obey it!</verse>
				<verse number="12">There is only one true Lawgiver and Judge, the One who has the power to save and destroy—so who do you think you are to judge your neighbor?</verse>
				<verse number="13">Listen, those of you who are boasting, “Today or tomorrow we’ll go to another city and spend some time and go into business and make heaps of profit!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">But you don’t have a clue what tomorrow may bring. For your fleeting life is but a warm breath of air that is visible in the cold only for a moment and then vanishes!</verse>
				<verse number="15">Instead you should say, “Our tomorrows are in the Lord’s hands and if he is willing we will live life to its fullest and do this or that.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But here you are, boasting in your ignorance, for to be presumptuous about what you’ll do tomorrow is evil!</verse>
				<verse number="17">So if you know of an opportunity to do the right thing today, yet you refrain from doing it, you’re guilty of sin.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Listen all you who are rich, for it’s time to weep and howl over the misery that will overtake you!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Your riches lie rotting, your fine clothing eaten by moths,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and your gold and silver are corroded as a witness against you. You have hoarded up treasure for the last days but it will become a fire to burn your flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Listen! Can’t you hear the cries of the laborers over the wages you fraudulently held back from those who worked for you? The cries for justice of those you’ve cheated have reached the ears of the Lord of armies!</verse>
				<verse number="5">You have indulged yourselves with every luxury and pleasure this world offers, but you’re only stuffing your heart full for a day of slaughter.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You have condemned and murdered good and innocent people who had no power to defend themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Meanwhile, brothers and sisters, we must be patient and filled with expectation as we wait for the appearing of the Lord. Think about the farmer who has to patiently wait for the earth’s harvest as it ripens because of the early and latter rains.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So you also, keep your hopes high and be patient, for the presence of the Lord is drawing closer.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Since each of you are part of God’s family never complain or grumble about each other so that judgment will not come on you, for the true Judge is near and very ready to appear!</verse>
				<verse number="10">My brothers and sisters, take the prophets as your mentors. They have prophesied in the name of the Lord and it brought them great sufferings, yet they patiently endured.</verse>
				<verse number="11">We honor them as our heroes because they remained faithful even while enduring great sufferings. And you have heard of all that Job went through and we can now see that the Lord ultimately treated him with wonderful kindness, revealing how tenderhearted he really is!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Above all we must be those who never need to verify our speech as truthful by swearing by the heavens or the earth or any other oath. But instead we must be so full of integrity that our “Yes” or “No” is convincing enough and we do not stumble into hypocrisy.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Are there any believers in your fellowship suffering great hardship and distress? Encourage them to pray! Are there happy, cheerful ones among you? Encourage them to sing out their praises!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Are there any sick among you? Then ask the elders of the church to come and pray over the sick and anoint them with oil in the name of our Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And the prayer of faith will heal the sick and the Lord will raise them up, and if they have committed sins they will be forgiven.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Confess and acknowledge how you have offended one another and then pray for one another to be instantly healed, for tremendous power is released through the passionate, heartfelt prayer of a godly believer!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Elijah was a man with human frailties, just like all of us, but he prayed and received supernatural answers. He actually shut the heavens over the land so there would be no rain for three and a half years!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then he prayed again and the skies opened up over the land so that the rain came again and produced the harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Finally, as members of God’s beloved family, we must go after the one who wanders from the truth and bring him back.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For the one who restores the sinning believer back to God from the error of his way, gives back to his soul life from the dead, and covers over countless sins by their demonstration of love!</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Peter, an apostle of Jesus the Anointed One, to the chosen ones who have been scattered like “seed” into the nations living as refugees in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, and throughout the Roman provinces of Asia and Bithynia.</verse>
				<verse number="2">You are not forgotten, for you have been chosen and destined by Father God. The Holy Spirit has set you apart to be God’s holy ones, obedient followers of Jesus Christ who have been gloriously sprinkled with his blood. May God’s delightful grace and peace cascade over you many times over!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Celebrate with praises the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has shown us his extravagant mercy. For his fountain of mercy has given us a new life—we are reborn to experience a living, energetic hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="4">We are reborn into a perfect inheritance that can never perish, never be defiled, and never diminish. It is promised and preserved forever in the heavenly realm for you!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Through our faith, the mighty power of God constantly guards us until our full salvation is ready to be revealed in the last time.</verse>
				<verse number="6">May the thought of this cause you to jump for joy, even though lately you’ve had to put up with the grief of many trials.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But these only reveal the sterling core of your faith, which is far more valuable than gold that perishes, for even gold is refined by fire. Your authentic faith will result in even more praise, glory, and honor when Jesus the Anointed One is revealed.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You love him passionately although you have not seen him, but through believing in him you are saturated with an ecstatic joy, indescribably sublime and immersed in glory.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For you are reaping the harvest of your faith—the full salvation promised you—your souls’ victory!</verse>
				<verse number="10">This salvation was the focus of the prophets who prophesied of this outpouring of grace that was destined for you. They made a careful search and investigation of the meaning of their God-given prophecies</verse>
				<verse number="11">as they probed into the mysteries of who would fulfill them and the time period when it would all take place. The Spirit of the Anointed One was in them and was pointing prophetically to the sufferings that Christ was destined to suffer and the glories that would be released afterward.</verse>
				<verse number="12">God revealed to the prophets that their ministry was not for their own benefit but for yours. And now, you have heard these things from the evangelists who preached the gospel to you through the power of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—the gospel containing wonderful mysteries that even the angels long to get a glimpse of.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So then, prepare your hearts and minds for action! Stay alert and fix your hope firmly on the marvelous grace that is coming to you. For when Jesus Christ is unveiled, a greater measure of grace will be released to you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">As God’s obedient children, never again shape your lives by the desires that you followed when you didn’t know better.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Instead, shape your lives to become like the Holy One who called you.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For Scripture says: “You are to be holy, because I am holy.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Since you call on him as your heavenly Father, the impartial Judge who judges according to each one’s works, live each day with holy awe and reverence throughout your time on earth.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For you know that your lives were ransomed once and for all from the empty and futile way of life handed down from generation to generation. It was not a ransom payment of silver and gold, which eventually perishes,</verse>
				<verse number="19">but the precious blood of Christ—who like a spotless, unblemished lamb was sacrificed for us.</verse>
				<verse number="20">This was part of God’s plan, for he was chosen and destined for this before the foundation of the earth was laid, but he has been made manifest in these last days for you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">It is through him that you now believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, so that you would fasten your faith and hope in God alone.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Now, because of your obedience to the truth, you have purified your very souls, and this empowers you to be full of love for your fellow believers. So express this sincere love toward one another passionately and with a pure heart.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For through the eternal and living Word of God you have been born again. And this “seed” that he planted within you can never be destroyed but will live and grow inside of you forever. For:</verse>
				<verse number="24">Human beings are frail and temporary, like grass, and the glory of man fleeting like blossoms of the field. The grass dries and withers and the flowers fall off,</verse>
				<verse number="25">but the Word of the Lord endures forever! And this is the Word that was announced to you!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">So abandon every form of evil, deceit, hypocrisy, feelings of jealousy and slander.</verse>
				<verse number="2">In the same way that nursing infants cry for milk, you must intensely crave the pure spiritual milk of God’s Word. For this “milk” will cause you to grow into maturity, fully nourished and strong for life —</verse>
				<verse number="3">especially now that you have had a taste of the goodness of Yahweh and have experienced his kindness.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So keep coming to him who is the Living Stone —though he was rejected and discarded by men but chosen by God and is priceless in God’s sight.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Come and be his “living stones” who are continually being assembled into a sanctuary for God. For now you serve as holy priests, offering up spiritual sacrifices that he readily accepts through Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For it says in Scripture: Look! I lay a cornerstone in Zion, a chosen and priceless stone! And whoever believes in him will certainly not be disappointed.</verse>
				<verse number="7">As believers you know his great worth—indeed, his preciousness is imparted to you. But for those who do not believe: The stone that the builders rejected and discarded has now become the cornerstone</verse>
				<verse number="8">And A stone that makes them stumble and a rock to trip over. They keep stumbling over the message because they refuse to believe it. And this they were destined to do.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But you are God’s chosen treasure —priests who are kings, a spiritual “nation” set apart as God’s devoted ones. He called you out of darkness to experience his marvelous light, and now he claims you as his very own. He did this so that you would broadcast his glorious wonders throughout the world.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For at one time you were not God’s people, but now you are. At one time you knew nothing of God’s mercy, because you hadn’t received it yet, but now you are drenched with it!</verse>
				<verse number="11">My divinely loved friends, since you are resident aliens and foreigners in this world, I appeal to you to divorce yourselves from the evil desires that wage war within you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Live honorable lives as you mix with unbelievers, even though they accuse you of being evildoers. For they will see your beautiful works and have a reason to glorify God in the day he visits us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">In order to honor the Lord, you must respect and defer to the authority of every human institution, whether it be the highest ruler</verse>
				<verse number="14">or the governors he puts in place to punish lawbreakers and to praise those who do what’s right.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For it is God’s will for you to silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right.</verse>
				<verse number="16">As God’s loving servants, you should live in complete freedom, but never use your freedom as a cover-up for evil.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Recognize the value of every person and continually show love to every believer. Live your lives with great reverence and in holy awe of God. Honor your rulers.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Those who are servants, submit to the authority of those who are your masters—not only to those who are kind and gentle but even to those who are hard and difficult.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You find God’s favor by deciding to please God even when you endure hardships because of unjust suffering.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For what merit is it to endure mistreatment for wrongdoing? Yet if you are mistreated when you do what is right, and you faithfully endure it, this is commendable before God.</verse>
				<verse number="21">In fact, you were called to live this way, because Christ also suffered in your place, leaving you his example for you to follow.</verse>
				<verse number="22">He never sinned and he never spoke deceitfully.</verse>
				<verse number="23">When he was verbally abused, he did not return with an insult; when he suffered, he would not threaten retaliation. Jesus faithfully entrusted himself into the hands of God, who judges righteously.</verse>
				<verse number="24">He himself carried our sins in his body on the cross so that we would be dead to sin and live for righteousness. Our instant healing flowed from his wounding.</verse>
				<verse number="25">You were like sheep that continually wandered away, but now you have returned to the true Shepherd of your lives—the kind Guardian who lovingly watches over your souls.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">And now let me speak to the wives. Be devoted to your own husbands, so that even if some of them do not obey the Word of God, your kind conduct may win them over without you saying a thing.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For when they observe your pure, godly life before God, it will impact them deeply.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Let your true beauty come from your inner personality, not a focus on the external. For lasting beauty comes from a gentle and peaceful spirit, which is precious in God’s sight and is much more important than the outward adornment of elaborate hair, jewelry, and fine clothes.</verse>
				<verse number="4"></verse>
				<verse number="5">Holy women of long ago who had set their hopes in God beautified themselves with lives lived in deference to their own husbands’ authority.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For example, our “mother,” Sarah, devoted herself to her husband, Abraham, and even called him “master.” And you have become her daughters when you do what is right without fear and intimidation.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Husbands, you in turn must treat your wives with tenderness, viewing them as feminine partners who deserve to be honored, for they are co-heirs with you of the “ divine grace of life,” so that nothing will hinder your prayers.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now, this is the goal: to live in harmony with one another and demonstrate affectionate love, sympathy, and kindness toward other believers. Let humility describe who you are as you dearly love one another.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Never retaliate when someone treats you wrongly, nor insult those who insult you, but instead, respond by speaking a blessing over them—because a blessing is what God promised to give you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For the Scriptures tell us: Whoever wants to embrace true life and find beauty in each day</verse>
				<verse number="11">must stop speaking evil, hurtful words and never deceive in what they say. Always turn from what is wrong and cultivate what is good; eagerly pursue peace in every relationship, making it your prize.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For the eyes of the Lord Yahweh rest upon the godly, and his heart responds to their prayers. But he turns his back on those who practice evil.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Why would anyone harm you if you’re passionate and devoted to pleasing God?</verse>
				<verse number="14">But even if you happen to suffer for doing what is right, you will have the joyful experience of the blessing of God. And Don’t be intimidated or terrified by those who would terrify you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But give reverent honor in your hearts to the Anointed One and treat him as the holy Master of your lives. And if anyone asks about the hope living within you, always be ready to explain your faith</verse>
				<verse number="16">with gentleness and respect. Maintain a clean conscience, so that those who slander you for living a pure life in Christ will have to lie about you and will be ashamed because of their slander.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For it is better to suffer for doing good, if it is in God’s plan, than for doing evil.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Christ suffered and died for sins once and for all—the innocent for the guilty —to bring you near to God by his body being put to death and by being raised to life by the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He went in the spiritual realm and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison</verse>
				<verse number="20">because of their disobedience of long ago. For during the time of Noah God patiently waited while the ark was being prepared, but only a few were brought safely through the floodwaters: a total of eight souls.</verse>
				<verse number="21">This was a prophetic picture of the immersion that now saves you—not a bathing of the physical body but rather the response of a good conscience before God through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="22">who is now in heaven at the place of supreme authority next to God. The very powers of heaven, including every angel and authority, now yield in submission to him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Since Christ, though innocent, suffered in his flesh for you, now you also must be a prepared soldier, having the same mind-set, for whoever has died in his body is done with sin.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So live the rest of your earthly life no longer concerned with human desires but consumed with what brings pleasure to God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For you have already spent enough time doing what unbelievers love to do—living in debauchery, sensuality, partying, drunkenness, wild drinking parties, and the worship of demons.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They marvel that you no longer rush to join them in the excesses of their corrupt lifestyles, and so they vilify you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But one day they will have to give an account to the one who is destined to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="6">This is the reason the gospel was preached to the martyrs before they gave their lives. Even though they were judged by human standards, now they live in spirit by God’s standards.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Since we are approaching the end of all things, be intentional, purposeful, and self-controlled so that you can be given to prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Above all, constantly echo God’s intense love for one another, for love will be a canopy over a multitude of sins.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Be compassionate to foreigners without complaining.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Every believer has received grace gifts, so use them to serve one another as faithful stewards of the many-colored tapestry of God’s grace.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For example, if you have a speaking gift, speak as though God were speaking his words through you. If you have the gift of serving, do it passionately with the strength God gives you, so that in everything God alone will be glorified through Jesus Christ. For to him belong the power and the glory forever throughout all ages! Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Beloved friends, if life gets extremely difficult, with many tests, don’t be bewildered as though something strange were overwhelming you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Instead, continue to rejoice, for you, in a measure, have shared in the sufferings of the Anointed One so that you can share in the revelation of his glory and celebrate with even greater gladness!</verse>
				<verse number="14">If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are greatly blessed, because the Spirit of glory and power, who is the Spirit of God, rests upon you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Let none of you merit suffering as a murderer, or thief, or criminal, or as one who meddles in the affairs of others.</verse>
				<verse number="16">If you suffer for being a Christian, don’t consider it a disgrace but a privilege. Glorify God because you carry the Anointed One’s name.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the time is ripe for judgment to begin in God’s own household. And if it starts with us, what will be the fate of those who refuse to obey the gospel of God?</verse>
				<verse number="18">And: If the righteous are barely saved, what will become of the wicked and godless?</verse>
				<verse number="19">So then, those who suffer for following God’s will should enfold their lives into the Creator, who will never fail them, and continue to always do what is right.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Now, I encourage you as an elder, an eyewitness of the sufferings of Christ, and one who shares in the glory that is about to be unveiled. I urge my fellow elders among you</verse>
				<verse number="2">to be compassionate shepherds who tenderly care for God’s flock and who feed them well, for you have the responsibility to guide, protect, and oversee. Consider it a joyous pleasure and not merely a religious duty. Lead from the heart under God’s leadership—not as a way to gain finances dishonestly but as a way to eagerly and cheerfully serve.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Don’t be controlling tyrants but lead others by your beautiful examples to the flock.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And when the Shepherd-King appears, you will win the victor’s crown of glory that never fades away.</verse>
				<verse number="5">In the same way, the younger ones should willingly support the leadership of the elders. In every relationship, each of you must wrap around yourself the apron of a humble servant. Because: God resists you when you are proud but multiplies grace and favor when you are humble.</verse>
				<verse number="6">If you bow low in God’s awesome presence, he will eventually exalt you as you leave the timing in his hands.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Pour out all your worries and stress upon him and leave them there, for he always tenderly cares for you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Be well balanced and always alert, because your enemy, the devil, roams around incessantly, like a roaring lion looking for its prey to devour.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Take a decisive stand against him and resist his every attack with strong, vigorous faith. For you know that your believing brothers and sisters around the world are experiencing the same kinds of troubles you endure.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And then, after your brief suffering, the God of all loving grace, who has called you to share in his eternal glory in Christ, will personally and powerfully restore you and make you stronger than ever. Yes, he will set you firmly in place and build you up.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And he has all the power needed to do this —forever! Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I, Peter, with the help of Silas, whom I consider a trustworthy, faith-filled brother, have written you this short letter so that I might encourage you and personally testify that this is the true, dependable grace of God. Stand fast in this grace.</verse>
				<verse number="13">She who is in Babylon, who is co-elect with you, sends her greetings, along with Mark, my son.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Greet one another with a kiss of peace. Peace to all who are in life union with Christ. Amen.</verse>
			</chapter>
		</book>
		<book number="61">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">This letter is from Simeon Peter, a loving servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I am writing to those who have been given a faith as equally precious as ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="2">May grace and perfect peace cascade over you as you live in the rich knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Everything we could ever need for life and godliness has already been deposited in us by his divine power. For all this was lavished upon us through the rich experience of knowing him who has called us by name and invited us to come to him through a glorious manifestation of his goodness.</verse>
				<verse number="4">As a result of this, he has given you magnificent promises that are beyond all price, so that through the power of these tremendous promises we can experience partnership with the divine nature, by which you have escaped the corrupt desires that are of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So devote yourselves to lavishly supplementing your faith with goodness, and to goodness add understanding,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and to understanding add the strength of self-control, and to self-control add patient endurance, and to patient endurance add godliness,</verse>
				<verse number="7">and to godliness add mercy toward your brothers and sisters, and to mercy toward others add unending love.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Since these virtues are already planted deep within, and you possess them in abundant supply, they will keep you from being inactive or fruitless in your pursuit of knowing Jesus Christ more intimately.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But if anyone lacks these things, he is blind, constantly closing his eyes to the mysteries of our faith, and forgetting his innocence —for his past sins have been washed away.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For this reason, beloved ones, be eager to confirm and validate that God has invited you to salvation and claimed you as his own. If you do these things, you will never stumble.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As a result, the kingdom’s gates will open wide to you as God choreographs your triumphant entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I won’t hesitate to continually remind you of these truths, even though you are aware of them and are well established in the present measure of truth you have already embraced.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And as long as I live I will continue to awaken you with this reminder,</verse>
				<verse number="14">since our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, has clearly revealed that my departure is near.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Indeed, I’m passionate to share these things with you so that you will always remember them after my exodus from this life.</verse>
				<verse number="16">We were not retelling some masterfully crafted legend when we informed you of the power and appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, for we saw his magnificence and splendor unveiled before our very eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yes, Father God lavished upon him radiant glory and honor when his distinct voice spoke out of the realm of majestic glory, endorsing him with these words: This is my cherished Son, marked by my love. All my delight is found in him!</verse>
				<verse number="18">And we ourselves heard that voice resound from the heavens while we were with him on the holy mountain.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And so we have been given the prophetic word—the written message of the prophets, made more reliable and fully validated by the confirming voice of God on the Mount of Transfiguration. And you will continue to do well if you stay focused on it. For this prophetic message is like a piercing light shining in a gloomy place until the dawning of a new day, when the Morning Star rises in your hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You must understand this at the outset: Interpretation of scriptural prophecy requires the Holy Spirit, for it does not originate from someone’s own imagination.</verse>
				<verse number="21">No true prophecy comes from human initiative but is inspired by the moving of the Holy Spirit upon those who spoke the message that came from God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">In the past there arose false prophets among God’s people, just as there will continue to be false teachers who will secretly infiltrate in your midst to divide you, bringing with them their destructive heresies. They will even deny the Master, who paid the price for them, bringing swift destruction on themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Many will follow immoral lifestyles. Because of these corrupt false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They are only out for themselves, ready to exploit you for their own gain through their cunning arguments. Their condemnation has been a long time coming. But their destruction does not slumber or sit idly by, for it is sure to come.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now, don’t forget, God had no pity for the angels when they sinned but threw them into the lowest, darkest dungeon of gloom and locked them in chains, where they are firmly held until the judgment of torment.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And he did not spare the former world in the days of Noah when he sent a flood to destroy a depraved world (although he protected Noah, the preacher of righteousness, along with seven members of his family).</verse>
				<verse number="6">And don’t forget that he reduced to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, condemning them to ruin and destruction. God appointed them to be examples as to what is coming to the ungodly.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Yet he rescued a righteous man, Lot, suffering the indignity of the unbridled lusts of the lawless.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For righteous Lot lived among them day after day, distressed in his righteous soul by the rebellious deeds he saw and heard.</verse>
				<verse number="9">If the Lord Yahweh rescued Lot, he knows how to continually rescue the godly from their trials and to reserve the ungodly for punishment on the day of judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And this especially applies to those who live their lives despising authorities and who abandon themselves to chasing the depraved lusts of their flesh. They are willfully arrogant and insolent, unafraid to insult the glorious ones.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Yet even angels, who are greater than they in power and strength, do not dare slander them before the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="12">These individuals are nothing but brute beasts—irrational creatures, born in the wild to be caught and destroyed—and they will perish like beasts. They are professional insulters, who slander whatever they don’t understand, and in their destruction they will be destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For all the evil they have done will come crashing down on them. They consider it their great pleasure to carouse in broad daylight. When they come to your love feasts they are but stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions as they feast with you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They are addicted to adultery, with eyes that are insatiable, with sins that never end. They seduce the vulnerable and are experts in their greed—they are but children of a curse!</verse>
				<verse number="15">They have wandered off the main road and have gone astray, because they are prophets who love profit—the wages they earn by wrongdoing. They are following the example of Balaam, son of Beor,</verse>
				<verse number="16">who was rebuked for evil by a donkey incapable of speech yet that spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.</verse>
				<verse number="17">These people are dried-up riverbeds, waterless clouds pushed along by stormy winds—the deepest darkness of gloom has been prepared for them.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They spout off with their grandiose, impressive nonsense. Consumed with the lusts of the flesh, they lure back into sin those who recently escaped from their error.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They promise others freedom, yet they themselves are slaves to corruption, for people are slaves to whatever overcomes them.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Those who escape the corrupting forces of this world system through the experience of knowing about our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Messiah, then go back into entanglement with them and are defeated by them, becoming worse off than they were to start with.</verse>
				<verse number="21">It would have been much better for them never to have experienced the way of righteousness than to know it and then turn away from the sacred obligation that was given to them.</verse>
				<verse number="22">They become illustrations of the true proverb: A dog will return to his own vomit and a washed pig to its rolling in the mud.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Beloved friends, this is now the second letter I have written to you in which I’ve attempted to stir you up and awaken you to a proper mind-set.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So never forget both the prophecies spoken by the holy prophets of old and the teaching of our Lord and Savior spoken by your apostles.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Above all, you must understand that in the last days mockers will multiply, chasing after their evil desires.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They will say, “So what about this promise of his coming? Our ancestors are dead and buried, yet everything is still the same as it was since from the beginning of time until now.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But they conveniently overlook that from the beginning, the heavens and earth were created by God’s word. He spoke and the dry ground separated from the waters.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then long afterward he destroyed the world with a tremendous flood by those very waters.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And now, by the same powerful word, the heavens and the earth are reserved for fire, being kept for judgment day, when all the ungodly will perish.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So, dear friends, don’t let this one thing escape your notice: a single day counts like a thousand years to the Lord Yahweh, and a thousand years counts as one day.</verse>
				<verse number="9">This means that, contrary to man’s perspective, the Lord is not late with his promise to return, as some measure lateness. But rather, his “delay” simply reveals his loving patience toward you, because he does not want any to perish but all to come to repentance.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The day of the Lord will come and take everyone by surprise—as unexpected as a home invasion. The atmosphere will be set on fire and vanish with a horrific roar, and the heavenly bodies will melt away as in a tremendous blaze. The earth and every activity of man will be laid bare.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Since all these things are on the verge of being dismantled, don’t you see how vital it is to live a holy life? We must be consumed with godliness</verse>
				<verse number="12">while we anticipate and help to speed up the coming of the day of God, when the atmosphere will be set on fire and the heavenly bodies consumed in a blaze.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But as we wait, we trust in God’s royal proclamation to be fulfilled. There are coming heavens new in quality, and an earth new in quality, where righteousness will be fully at home.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So, my beloved friends, with all that you have to look forward to, may you be eager to be found living pure lives when you come into his presence, without blemish and filled with peace.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And keep in mind that our Lord’s extraordinary patience simply means more opportunity for salvation, just as our dear brother Paul wrote to you with the wisdom that God gave him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He consistently speaks of these things in all of his letters, even though he writes some concepts that are overwhelming to our understanding, which the unlearned and unstable love to twist to their spiritual ruin, as they do to other Scriptures.</verse>
				<verse number="17">As for you, divinely loved ones, since you are forewarned of these things, be careful that you are not led astray by the error of the lawless and lose your firm grip on the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But continue to grow and increase in God’s grace and intimacy with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. May he receive all the glory both now and until the day eternity begins. Amen!</verse>

				<verse number="1">We saw him with our very own eyes. We gazed upon him and heard him speak. Our hands actually touched him, the one who was from the beginning, the Living Expression of God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">This Life-Giver was made visible and we have seen him. We testify to this truth: the eternal Life-Giver lived face-to-face with the Father and has now dawned upon us.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So we proclaim to you what we have seen and heard about this Life-Giver so that we may share and enjoy this life together. For truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="4">We are writing these things to you because we want to release to you our fullness of joy.</verse>
				<verse number="5">This is the life-giving message we heard him share and it’s still ringing in our ears. We now repeat his words to you: God is pure light. You will never find even a trace of darkness in him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">If we claim that we share life with him, but keep walking in the realm of darkness, we’re fooling ourselves and not living the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But if we keep living in the pure light that surrounds him, we share unbroken fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, continually cleanses us from all sin.</verse>
				<verse number="8">If we boast that we have no sin, we’re only fooling ourselves and are strangers to the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But if we freely admit our sins when his light uncovers them, he will be faithful to forgive us every time. God is just to forgive us our sins because of Christ, and he will continue to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="10">If we claim that we’re not guilty of sin when God uncovers it with his light, we make him a liar and his word is not in us.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">You are my dear children, and I write these things to you so that you won’t sin. But if anyone does sin, we continually have a forgiving Redeemer who is face-to-face with the Father: Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Here’s how we can be sure that we’ve truly come to know God: if we keep his commands.</verse>
				<verse number="4">If someone claims, “I have come to know God by experience,” yet doesn’t keep God’s commands, he is a phony and the truth finds no place in him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But the love of God will be perfected within the one who obeys God’s Word. We can be sure that we’ve truly come to live in intimacy with God,</verse>
				<verse number="6">not just by saying, “I am intimate with God,” but by walking in the footsteps of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Beloved, I’m not writing a new commandment to you, but an old one that you had from the beginning, and you’ve already heard it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yet, in a sense, it is a new commandment, as its truth is made manifest both in Christ and in you, because the darkness is disappearing and the true light is already blazing.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Anyone who says, “I am in the light,” while holding hatred in his heart toward a fellow believer is still in the darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But the one who truly loves a fellow believer lives in the light, and there is nothing in him that will cause someone else to stumble.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But whoever hates a fellow believer lives in the darkness—stumbling around in the dark with no clue where he is going, for he is blinded by the darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I remind you, dear children: your sins have been permanently removed because of the power of his name.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I remind you, fathers and mothers: you have a relationship with the One who has existed from the beginning. And I remind you, young people: you have defeated the Evil One.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I write these things to you, dear children, because you truly have a relationship with the Father. I write these things, fathers and mothers, because you have had a true relationship with him who is from the beginning. And I write these things, young people, because you are strong, the Word of God is treasured in your hearts, and you have defeated the Evil One.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Don’t set the affections of your heart on this world or in loving the things of the world. The love of the Father and the love of the world are incompatible.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For all that the world can offer us—the gratification of our flesh, the allurement of the things of the world, and the obsession with status and importance —none of these things come from the Father but from the world.</verse>
				<verse number="17">This world and its desires are in the process of passing away, but those who love to do the will of God live forever.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Dear children, the end of this age is near! You have heard that Antichrist is arising, and in fact, many enemies of Christ have already appeared, and this is how we know that we are living in the closing hour of this age.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For even though they were once a part of us, they withdrew from us because they were never really of our number. For if they had truly belonged to us they would have continued with us. By leaving our community of believers they made it obvious that they never really belonged to us.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But the Holy One has anointed you and you all know the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So I’m writing to you not because you don’t know the truth, but because you do know it, and no lie belongs to the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Who is the real liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ. He is the real antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Whoever rejects the Son rejects the Father. Whoever embraces the Son embraces the Father also.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So you must be sure to keep the message burning in your hearts; that is, the message of life you heard from the beginning. If you do, you will always be living in close fellowship with the Son and with the Father.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And he himself has promised us the never-ending life of the ages to come!</verse>
				<verse number="26">I’ve written these things about those who are attempting to lead you astray.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But the wonderful anointing you have received from God is so much greater than their deception and now lives in you. There’s no need for anyone to keep teaching you. His anointing teaches you all that you need to know, for it will lead you into truth, not a counterfeit. So just as the anointing has taught you, remain in him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And now, dear children, remain in him, so that when he is revealed we may have joyful confidence and not be ashamed when we stand before him at his appearing.</verse>
				<verse number="29">If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who lives in righteousness has been divinely fathered by him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Look with wonder at the depth of the Father’s marvelous love that he has lavished on us! He has called us and made us his very own beloved children. The reason the world doesn’t recognize who we are is that they didn’t recognize him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Beloved, we are God’s children right now; however, it is not yet apparent what we will become. But we do know that when it is finally made visible, we will be just like him, for we will see him as he truly is.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And all who focus their hope on him will always be purifying themselves, just as Jesus is pure.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Anyone who indulges in sin lives in moral anarchy, for the definition of sin is breaking God’s law.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And you know without a doubt that Jesus was revealed to eradicate sins, and there is no sin in him. Anyone who continues to live in union with him will not sin.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But the one who continues sinning hasn’t seen him with discernment or known him by intimate experience.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Delightfully loved children, don’t let anyone divert you from this truth. The person who keeps doing what is right proves that he is righteous before God, even as the Messiah is righteous.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But the one who indulges in a sinful life is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God was revealed was to undo and destroy the works of the devil.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Everyone who is truly God’s child will refuse to keep sinning because God’s seed remains within him, and he is unable to continue sinning because he has been fathered by God himself.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Here is how God’s children can be clearly distinguished from the children of the Evil One. Anyone who does not demonstrate righteousness and show love to fellow believers is not living with God as his source.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The beautiful message you’ve heard right from the start is that we should walk in self-sacrificing love toward one another.</verse>
				<verse number="12">We should not be like Cain, who yielded to the Evil One and brutally murdered his own brother, Abel. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother’s righteous.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So don’t be shocked, beloved brothers and sisters, if you experience the world’s hatred.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yet we can be assured that we have been translated from spiritual death into spiritual life because we love the family of believers. A loveless life remains spiritually dead.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Everyone who keeps hating a fellow believer is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">This is how we have discovered love’s reality: Jesus sacrificed his life for us. Because of this great love, we should be willing to lay down our lives for one another.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If anyone sees a fellow believer in need and has the means to help him, yet shows no pity and closes his heart against him, how is it even possible that God’s love lives in him?</verse>
				<verse number="18">Beloved children, our love can’t be an abstract theory we only talk about, but a way of life demonstrated through our loving deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="19">We know that the truth lives within us because we demonstrate love in action, which will reassure our hearts in his presence.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Whenever our hearts make us feel guilty and remind us of our failures, we know that God is much greater and more merciful than our conscience, and he knows everything there is to know about us.</verse>
				<verse number="21">My delightfully loved friends, when our hearts don’t condemn us, we have a bold freedom to speak face-to-face with God.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And whatever we ask of him we receive, because we keep his commands. And by our beautiful intentions we continue to do what brings pleasure to him.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So these are his commands: that we continually place our trust in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and that we keep loving one another, just as he has commanded us.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For all who obey his commands find their lives joined in union with him, and he lives and flourishes in them. We know and have proof that he constantly lives and flourishes in us, by the Spirit that he has given us.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Delightfully loved friends, don’t trust every spirit, but carefully examine what they say to determine if they are of God, because many false prophets have mingled into the world.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Here’s the test for those with the genuine Spirit of God: they will confess Jesus as the Christ who has come in the flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Everyone who does not acknowledge that Jesus is from God has the spirit of antichrist, which you heard was coming and is already active in the world.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Little children, you can be certain that you belong to God and have conquered them, for the One who is living in you is far greater than the one who is in the world.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They belong to this world and they articulate the spirit of this world, and the world listens to them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But we belong to God, and whoever truly knows God listens to us. Those who refuse to listen to us do not belong to God. That is how we can know the difference between the spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Those who are loved by God, let his love continually pour from you to one another, because God is love. Everyone who loves is fathered by God and experiences an intimate knowledge of him.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The one who doesn’t love has yet to know God, for God is love.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The light of God’s love shined within us when he sent his matchless Son into the world so that we might live through him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">This is love: He loved us long before we loved him. It was his love, not ours. He proved it by sending his Son to be the pleasing sacrificial offering to take away our sins.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Delightfully loved ones, if he loved us with such tremendous love, then “loving one another” should be our way of life!</verse>
				<verse number="12">No one has ever gazed upon the fullness of God’s splendor. But if we love one another, God makes his permanent home in us, and we make our permanent home in him, and his love is brought to its full expression in us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And he has given us his Spirit within us so that we can have the assurance that he lives in us and that we live in him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Moreover, we have seen with our own eyes and can testify to the truth that Father God has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Those who give thanks that Jesus is the Son of God live in God, and God lives in them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">We have come into an intimate experience with God’s love, and we trust in the love he has for us. God is love! Those who are living in love are living in God, and God lives through them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">By living in God, love has been brought to its full expression in us so that we may fearlessly face the day of judgment, because all that Jesus now is, so are we in this world.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Love never brings fear, for fear is always related to punishment. But love’s perfection drives the fear of punishment far from our hearts. Whoever walks constantly afraid of punishment has not reached love’s perfection.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Our love for others is our grateful response to the love God first demonstrated to us.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Anyone can say, “I love God,” yet have hatred toward another believer. This makes him a phony, because if you don’t love a brother or sister, whom you can see, how can you truly love God, whom you can’t see?</verse>
				<verse number="21">For he has given us this command: whoever loves God must also demonstrate love to others.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah is God’s spiritual child and has been fathered by God himself. And everyone who loves Father God loves his children as well.</verse>
				<verse number="2">This is how we can be sure that we love the children of God: by having a passionate love for God and by obedience to his commands.</verse>
				<verse number="3">True love for God means obeying his commands, and his commands don’t weigh us down as heavy burdens.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You see, every child of God overcomes the world, for our faith is the victorious power that triumphs over the world.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So who are the world conquerors, defeating its power? Those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus Christ is the One who was revealed as God’s Son by his water baptism and by the blood of his cross —not by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit, who is truth, confirms this with his testimony.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So we have these three constant witnesses giving their evidence:</verse>
				<verse number="8">the Spirit, the water, and the blood. And these three are in agreement.</verse>
				<verse number="9">If we accept the testimony of men, how much more should we accept the more authoritative testimony of God that he has testified concerning his Son?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Those who believe in the Son of God have the living testimony in their hearts. Those who don’t believe have made God out to be a liar by not believing the testimony God has confirmed about his Son.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This is the true testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life has its source in his Son.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Whoever has the Son has eternal life; whoever does not have the Son does not possess eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I’ve written this letter to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you will be assured and know without a doubt that you have eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Since we have this confidence, we can also have great boldness before him, for if we ask anything agreeable to his will, he will hear us.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we also know that we have obtained the requests we ask of him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">If anyone observes a fellow believer habitually sinning in a way that doesn’t lead to death, you should keep interceding in prayer that God will give that person life. Now, there is a sin that leads to death, and I’m not encouraging you to pray for those who commit it.</verse>
				<verse number="17">All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin that does not result in death.</verse>
				<verse number="18">We are convinced that everyone fathered by God does not make sinning a way of life, because the Son of God protects the child of God, and the Evil One cannot touch him.</verse>
				<verse number="19">We know that we are God’s children and that the whole world lies under the misery and influence of the Evil One.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And we know that the Son of God has made our understanding come alive so that we can know by experience the One who is true. And we are in him who is true, God’s Son, Jesus Christ—the true God and eternal life!</verse>
				<verse number="21">So, little children, guard yourselves from worshiping anything but him.</verse>

				<verse number="1">From the elder to God’s chosen woman and her children: I love you all as those who are in the truth. And I’m not the only one, for all who come to know the truth share my love for you</verse>
				<verse number="2">because of the living truth that has a permanent home in us and will be with us forever.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Grace, mercy, and peace belong to us, flowing from the presence of God the Father and from Jesus Christ, Son of the Father and from the realm of true love.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I was delighted and filled with joy when I learned that your children are consistently living in the truth, just as we have received the command from the Father.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Dearest woman, I have a request to make of you. It is not a new commandment but a repetition of the one we have had from the beginning: that we constantly love one another.</verse>
				<verse number="6">This love means living in obedience to whatever God commands us. For to walk in love toward one another is the unifying commandment we’ve heard from the beginning.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Numerous deceivers have surfaced from among us and gone out into the world, people who will not acknowledge Jesus Christ coming as a man. These deceivers are antichrists!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Be on your guard so that you do not lose all that we have diligently worked for but receive a full reward.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Anyone who wanders away and does not remain faithful to the teaching of Christ has no relationship with God. But those who remain in the teaching of Christ have a wonderful relationship with both the Father and the Son.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So if anyone comes into your fellowship claiming to be a true believer yet doesn’t bring this teaching, you are not to consider him as a fellow believer, nor should you welcome him into your homes.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For if you welcome him as a believer, you will be partnering with him in his evil agenda.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Although I have many more subjects I’d like to discuss with you, I’d rather not include them in this letter. But I look forward to coming to visit and speaking with you face-to-face —for being together will complete our joy!</verse>

				<verse number="2">Beloved friend, I pray that you are prospering in every way and that you continually enjoy good health, just as your soul is prospering.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I was filled with joy and delight when the brothers arrived and informed me of your faithfulness to the truth. They told me how you live continually in the truth of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="4">It is the greatest joy of my life to hear that my children are consistently living their lives in the ways of truth!</verse>
				<verse number="5">My beloved friend, I commend you for your demonstration of faithful love by all that you have done for the brothers on their journey, even though they were strangers at the time.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They have shared publicly with the congregation about the beautiful acts of love you have shown them. Now, if you would be so kind, send them on their way with a generous gift, in a manner that would honor God.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You see, it was their passion for the glory of the name of Christ that launched them out, and they’ve not accepted financial support from unbelievers.</verse>
				<verse number="8">They are deserving of all the support we can give them, because through our giving we can partner with them for the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I have already written you once about this, but Diotrephes, who loves to be in charge and recognized as first among you, does not acknowledge our authority.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So if I come, I will address what he’s doing—spreading his malicious slander against us. And not content with that, he refuses to welcome our brothers, and he stands in the way of those who want to receive them and show them hospitality by throwing them out of the church!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Delightfully loved ones, don’t imitate what is evil, but imitate that which is good. Whoever does good is of God; whoever does evil has not seen God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As for Demetrius, everyone speaks very highly of him, and even the truth itself stands by his side. We too wholeheartedly endorse him, and you know that our recommendation is reliable.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Although I have many more subjects I’d like to discuss with you, I’d rather not include them in this letter.</verse>

				<verse number="1">From Judah, a loving servant of Jesus, the Anointed One, and brother of Jacob. I’m writing to the chosen ones who are wrapped in the love of Father God—kept and guarded for Jesus, the Messiah.</verse>
				<verse number="2">May God’s mercy, peace, and love cascade over you!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Dearly loved friend, I was fully intending to write to you about our amazing salvation we all participate in, but felt the need instead to challenge you to vigorously defend and contend for the beliefs that we cherish. For God, through the apostles, has once for all entrusted these truths to his holy believers.</verse>
				<verse number="4">There have been some who have sneaked in among you unnoticed. They are depraved people whose judgment was prophesied in Scripture a long time ago. They have perverted the message of God’s grace into a license to commit immorality and turn against our only absolute Master, our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I need to remind you, even though you are familiar with it all, that the Lord Jesus saved his people out of Egypt but subsequently destroyed those who were guilty of unbelief.</verse>
				<verse number="6">In the same way, there were heavenly messengers in rebellion who went outside their rightful domain of authority and abandoned their appointed realms. God bound them in everlasting chains and is keeping them in the dark abyss of the netherworld until the judgment of the great day.</verse>
				<verse number="7">In a similar way, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and nearby towns gave themselves to sexual immorality and the unnatural desire of different flesh. Now they all serve as examples of those who experience the punishment of eternal fire.</verse>
				<verse number="8">In the same way, these sensual “dreamers” corrupt and pollute the natural realm, while on the other hand they reject the spiritual realms of governmental power and repeatedly scoff at heavenly glories.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil over the body of Moses, dared not insult or slander him, but simply said, “The Lord Yahweh rebuke you!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">These people insult anything they don’t understand. They behave like irrational beasts by doing whatever they feel like doing. Because they live by their animal instincts, they corrupt themselves and bring about their own destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="11">How terrible it is for them! For they have followed in the steps of Cain. They have abandoned themselves to Balaam’s error because of their greedy pursuit of financial gain. And since they have rebelled like Korah rebelled, they will experience the same fate of Korah and likewise perish.</verse>
				<verse number="12">These false teachers are like dangerous hidden reefs at your love feasts, lying in wait to shipwreck the immature. They feast among you without reverence, having no shepherd but themselves. They are clouds with no rain, swept along by the winds. Like fruitless late-autumn trees —twice dead, barren, and plucked up by the roots!</verse>
				<verse number="13">They are wild waves of the sea, flinging out the foam of their shame and disgrace. They are misleading like wandering stars, for whom the complete darkness of eternal gloom has been reserved.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Enoch, the seventh direct descendant from Adam, prophesied of their doom when he said, “Look! Here comes the Lord Yahweh in his myriads of holy ones.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He comes to execute judgment against them all and to convict each one of them for their ungodly deeds and for all the terrible words that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">These people are always complaining and never satisfied—finding fault with everyone. They follow their own evil desires and their mouths speak scandalous things. They enjoy using seductive flattery to manipulate others.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But you, my delightfully loved friends, remember the prophecies of the apostles of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They taught you, “In the last days there will always be mockers, motivated by their own ungodly desires.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">These people cause divisions and are followers of their own natural instincts, devoid of the life of the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But you, my delightfully loved friends, constantly and progressively build yourselves up on the foundation of your most holy faith by praying every moment in the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Fasten your hearts to the love of God and receive the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, who gives us eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Keep being compassionate to those who still have doubts,</verse>
				<verse number="23">and snatch others out of the fire to save them. Be merciful over and over to them, but always couple your mercy with the fear of God. Be extremely careful to keep yourselves free from the pollutions of the flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Now, to the one with enough power to prevent you from stumbling into sin and bring you faultless before his glorious presence to stand before him with ecstatic delight,</verse>
				<verse number="25">to the only God our Savior, through our Lord Jesus Christ, be endless glory and majesty, great power and authority—from before he created time, now, and throughout all the ages of eternity. Amen!</verse>

				<verse number="1">This is the unveiling of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to share with his loving servants what must occur swiftly. He signified it by sending his angel to his loving servant John.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I, John, bore witness to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="3">A joyous blessing rests upon the one who reads this message and upon those who hear and embrace the words of this prophecy, for the appointed time is in your hands.</verse>
				<verse number="4">From John to the seven churches in western Turkey: May the kindness of God’s grace and peace overflow to you from him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven spirits who are in front of his throne,</verse>
				<verse number="5">and from Jesus Christ the Faithful Witness, the Firstborn from among the dead and the ruling King, who rules over the kings of the earth! Now to the one who constantly loves us and has loosed us from our sins by his own blood,</verse>

				<verse number="9">I, John, am your brother and companion in tribulation, the kingdom, and the patience that are found in Jesus. I was exiled on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I was in the spirit realm on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice sounding like a trumpet,</verse>
				<verse number="11">saying to me: Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, I saw seven golden lampstands.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And walking among the lampstands, I saw someone like a son of man, wearing a full-length robe with a golden sash over his chest.</verse>
				<verse number="14">His head and his hair were white like wool—white as glistening snow. And his eyes were like flames of fire!</verse>
				<verse number="15">His feet were gleaming like bright metal, as though they were glowing in a fire, and his voice was like the roar of many rushing waters.</verse>
				<verse number="16">In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. And his face was shining like the brightness of the blinding sun!</verse>
				<verse number="17">When I saw him, I fell down at his feet as good as dead, but he laid his right hand on me and I heard his reassuring voice saying: Don’t yield to fear. I am the Beginning and I am the End,</verse>
				<verse number="18">the Living One! I was dead, but now look—I am alive forever and ever. And I hold the keys that unlock death and the unseen world.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now I want you to write what you have seen, what is, and what comes after the things that I reveal to you.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The mystery of the lampstands and the seven stars is this: the seven lampstands are the seven churches, and the seven stars in my right hand are the seven messengers of the seven churches.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Ephesus. For these are the words of the one who holds the seven stars firmly in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands:</verse>
				<verse number="2">I know all that you’ve done for me—you have worked hard and persevered. I know that you don’t tolerate evil. You have tested those who claimed to be apostles and proved they are not, for they were imposters.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I also know how you have bravely endured trials and persecutions because of my name, yet you have not become discouraged.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But I have this against you: you have abandoned the passionate love you had for me at the beginning.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Think about how far you have fallen! Repent and do the works of love you did at first. I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place of influence if you do not repent.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Although, to your credit, you despise the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also despise.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is saying now to all the churches. To the one who overcomes I will give access to feast on the fruit of the Tree of Life that is found in the paradise of God.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Smyrna. For these are the words of the one who is the Beginning and the End, the one who became a corpse, but came back to life:</verse>
				<verse number="9">I am aware of all the painful difficulties you have passed through and your financial hardships, even though, in fact, you possess rich treasure. And I am fully aware of the slander that has come against you from those who claim to be Jews but are not, for they are a satanic congregation.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Do not yield to fear in the face of the suffering to come but be aware of this: the devil is about to have some of you thrown into prison to test your faith. For ten days you will have distress but remain faithful to the day you die, and I will give you the victor’s crown of life.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is presently saying to all the churches. The one who conquers will not be harmed by the second death.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Pergamum. For these are the words of the one whose words pierce the hearts of men:</verse>
				<verse number="13">I know where you live—where Satan sits enthroned, yet you still cling faithfully to the power of my name. You did not deny your faith in me even in the days of my faithful martyr Antipas, who was executed in your city, where Satan lives.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Nevertheless, I have a few things against you. There are some among you who hold to the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to eat things that were sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Furthermore, you have some who hold to the doctrines of the Nicolaitans.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So repent, then, or I will come quickly to war against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But the one whose heart is open, let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is presently saying to all the churches. To everyone who is victorious I will let him feast on the hidden manna and give him a shining white stone. And written upon the white stone is inscribed his new name, known only to the one who receives it.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Thyatira. For these are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished brass:</verse>
				<verse number="19">I know all that you’ve done for me—your love and faith, your ministry and steadfast perseverance. In fact, you now excel in these virtues even more than at the first.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But I have this against you: you are forgiving that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is seducing my loving servants. She is teaching that it is permissible to indulge in sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I have waited for her to repent from her vile immorality, but she willingly refuses to do so.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Now I will lay her low with terrible distress along with all her adulterous partners if they do not repent.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And I will strike down her followers with a deadly plague. Then all the congregations will realize that I am the one who thoroughly searches the most secret thought and the innermost being. I will give to each one what their works deserve.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But to the rest of you in Thyatira who don’t adhere to the teachings of Jezebel and have not been initiated into deep satanic secrets, I say to you (without laying upon you any other burden):</verse>
				<verse number="25">Cling tightly to all that you have until I appear.</verse>
				<verse number="26">To everyone who is victorious and continues to do my works to the very end I will give you authority over the nations</verse>
				<verse number="27">to shepherd them with a royal scepter. And the rebellious will be shattered as clay pots—</verse>
				<verse number="28">even as I also received authority from the presence of my Father. I will give the morning star to the one who experiences victory.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So the one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is presently saying to all the churches.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Sardis, for these are the words of the one who holds the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know all that you do and I know that you have a reputation for being really “alive,” but you’re actually dead!</verse>
				<verse number="2">Wake up and strengthen all that remains before it dies, for I haven’t found your works to be perfect in the sight of my God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So remember all the things you’ve received and heard, then turn back to God and obey them. For if you continue to slumber, I will come to you like a thief, and you’ll have no idea at what hour I will come.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yet there are still a few in Sardis who have remained pure, and they will walk in fellowship with me in brilliant light, for they are worthy.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And the one who experiences victory will be dressed in white robes and I will never, no never erase your name from the Book of Life. I will acknowledge your name before my Father and his angels.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So the one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is now saying to all the churches.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Philadelphia, for these are the solemn words of the Holy One, the true one, who has David’s key, who opens doors that none can shut and who closes doors that none can open:</verse>
				<verse number="8">I know all that you’ve done. Now I have set before you a wide-open door that none can shut. For I know that you possess only a little power, yet you’ve kept my word and haven’t denied my name.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Watch how I deal with those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews but are not, for they’re lying. I will make them come and bow down at your feet and acknowledge how much I’ve loved you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Because you’ve passionately kept my message of perseverance, I will also keep you from the hour of proving that is coming to test every person on earth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But I come swiftly, so cling tightly to what you have, so that no one may seize your crown of victory.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For the one who is victorious, I will make you to be a pillar in the sanctuary of my God, permanently secure. I will write on you the name of my God and the name of the city of my God—the New Jerusalem, descending from my God out of heaven. And I’ll write my own name on you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So the one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is now saying to all the churches.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Laodicea, for these are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation:</verse>
				<verse number="15">I know all that you do, and I know that you are neither frozen in apathy nor fervent with passion. How I wish you were either one or the other!</verse>
				<verse number="16">But because you are neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm, I am about to spit you from my mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For you claim, “I’m rich and getting richer—I don’t need a thing.” Yet you are clueless that you’re miserable, poor, blind, barren, and naked!</verse>
				<verse number="18">So I counsel you to purchase gold perfected by fire, so that you can be truly rich. Purchase a white garment to cover and clothe your shameful Adam-nakedness. Purchase eye salve to be placed over your eyes so that you can truly see.</verse>
				<verse number="19">All those I dearly love I unmask and train. So repent and be eager to pursue what is right.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Behold, I’m standing at the door, knocking. If your heart is open to hear my voice and you open the door within, I will come in to you and feast with you, and you will feast with me.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And to the one who conquers I will give the privilege of sitting with me on my throne, just as I conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is saying now to the churches.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Then suddenly, after I wrote down these messages, I saw a portal open into the heavenly realm, and the same trumpet-voice I heard speaking with me at the beginning said, “Ascend into this realm! I want to reveal to you what must happen after this.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Instantly I was taken into the spirit realm, and behold—I saw a heavenly throne being set in place and someone seated upon it.</verse>
				<verse number="3">His appearance was sparkling like crystal and glowing like a carnelian gemstone. Surrounding the throne was a circle of green light, like an emerald rainbow.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Encircling the great throne were twenty-four thrones with elders in glistening white garments seated upon them, each wearing a golden crown of victory.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And pulsing from the throne were blinding flashes of lightning, crashes of thunder, and voices. And burning before the throne were seven blazing torches, which represent the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And in front of the throne there was pavement like a crystal sea of glass. Around the throne and on each side stood four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The first living creature resembled a lion, the second an ox, the third had a human face, and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Each of the four living creatures had six wings, full of eyes all around and under their wings. They worshiped without ceasing, day and night, singing, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty! The Was, the Is, and the Coming!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">And whenever the living creatures gave glory, honor, and thanks to the One who is enthroned and who lives forever and ever,</verse>
				<verse number="10">the twenty-four elders fell facedown before the one seated on the throne and they worshiped the one who lives forever and ever. And they surrendered their crowns before the throne, singing:</verse>
				<verse number="11">“You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory, honor, and power, for you created all things, and for your pleasure they were created and exist.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">And I saw that the one seated on the throne was holding in his right hand an unopened scroll with writing on the inside and on the outside, and it was sealed with seven seals.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then I saw an incredibly powerful angel proclaiming with a great, loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and able to break its seven seals?”</verse>
				<verse number="3">But no person could be found, living or dead, in all of creation —no one was worthy to open the scroll and read its contents.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So I broke down weeping with intense sorrow, because there was found no one worthy to break open the scroll and read its contents.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then one of the elders said to me, “Stop weeping. Look! The mighty Lion of Judah’s tribe, the root of David—he has conquered! He is the worthy one who can open the scroll and its seven seals.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then I saw a young Lamb standing before the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders. He appeared to have been slaughtered but was now alive! He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out to the ends of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I saw the young Lamb approach the throne and take the scroll from the right hand of the one who sat there.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And when the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures saw the Lamb had taken the scroll, they fell facedown at the feet of the Lamb and worshiped him. Each of them had a harp and golden bowls brimming full of sweet fragrant incense—which are the prayers of God’s holy lovers.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And they were all singing this new song of praise to the Lamb: “Because you were slaughtered for us, you are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals. Your blood was the price paid to redeem us. You purchased us to bring us to God out of every tribe, language, people group, and nation.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You have chosen us to serve our God and formed us into a kingdom of priests who reign on the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then I looked, and I heard the voices of myriads of angels in circles around the throne, as well as the voices of the living creatures and the elders—myriads and myriads!</verse>
				<verse number="12">And as I watched, all of them were singing with thunderous voices: “Worthy is Christ the Lamb who was slaughtered to receive great power and might, wealth and wisdom, and honor, glory, and praise!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then every living being joined the angelic choir. Every creature in heaven and on earth, under the earth, in the sea, and everything in them, were worshiping with one voice, saying: “Praise, honor, glory, and dominion be to God-Enthroned and to Christ the Lamb forever and ever!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then the four living creatures responded: “Amen!” And the twenty-four elders threw themselves facedown to the ground and worshiped.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Then I watched as the Lamb broke open the first of the seven seals. Immediately I heard one of the four living creatures call out with a powerful voice of revelation sounding like thunder, saying, “Come forth!”</verse>
				<verse number="2">So I looked, and behold, there was a bright white horse. Its rider had a bow and was given a crown of victory. He rode out as a conqueror ready to conquer.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When he broke open the second seal, I heard the second living creature call out: “Come forth!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">And there appeared another horse, red like fiery flames, and its rider was given a great sword and the power to take peace from the earth, causing one to put to death another.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then he broke open the third seal, and I heard the third living creature call out, “Come forth!” And behold, I saw a black horse right in front of me, and its rider was holding measuring scales.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And I heard what seemed to be a voice from among the living creatures saying, “A small measure of wheat for a day’s pay, and three measures of barley for a day’s pay, but don’t harm the olive trees producing oil and the vines producing wine.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">When he broke open the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature call out, “Come forth!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">And behold, I saw a green horse, and its rider’s name was Death, and Death’s Domain followed him. They were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, famine, death, and by the wild beasts.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When the Lamb broke open the fifth seal, I saw gathered under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the Word of God and because they had the testimony of the Lamb.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Sovereign Lord, holy and dependable, how long before you judge those who live on the earth and vindicate our blood on them?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Each one was given a glistening white robe. And they were told to rest a little longer, until the full number was fulfilled of both their fellow servants and brothers and sisters who were going to be killed just as they had been.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And behold! I saw the Lamb break open the sixth seal, which released a powerful earthquake. I saw the sun become pitch black and the full moon become bloodred.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The stars fell from heaven to the earth, as a fig tree shaken by a stormy wind sheds its unripe figs.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The sky receded with a snap—as a scroll rolls itself up. And every mountain and island was moved from its place.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the kings of the earth and its great princes and generals, the rich and powerful, and everyone, whether they were slave or free, ran for cover and hid in the caves and among the mountain boulders.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They called out to the mountains and the boulders, saying, “Fall on us at once! Hide us quickly from the glorious face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,</verse>
				<verse number="17">for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, and they were restraining the four winds so that no wind would blow on the land, on the sea, or on any tree.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, who had the seal of the living God. He shouted out with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to damage earth and sea,</verse>
				<verse number="3">saying, “Do not damage the earth, the sea, or the trees until we have marked the loving servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">And I discovered the number of those who were sealed. It was one hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of Israel’s people.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Judah. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Reuben. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Gad.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Asher. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Naphtali. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Manasseh.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Simeon. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Levi. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Issachar.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Zebulun. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Joseph. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
				<verse number="9">After this I looked, and behold, right in front of me I saw a vast multitude of people—an enormous multitude so huge that no one could count—made up of victorious ones from every nation, tribe, people group, and language. They were all in glistening white robes, standing before the throne and before the Lamb with palm branches in their hands.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And they shouted out with a passionate voice: “Salvation belongs to our God seated on the throne and to the Lamb!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">All the angels were standing in a circle around the throne with the elders and the four living creatures, and they all fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,</verse>
				<verse number="12">singing: “Amen! Praise and glory, wisdom and thanksgiving, honor, power, and might belong to our God forever and ever! Amen!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then one of the elders asked me, “Who are these in glistening white robes, and where have they come from?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">I answered, “My lord—you must know.” Then he said to me, “They are ones who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb and have emerged from the midst of great pressure and ordeal.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For this reason they are before the throne of God, ministering to him as priests day and night, within his cloud-filled sanctuary. And the enthroned One spreads over them his tabernacle-shelter.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Their souls will be completely satisfied. And neither the sun nor any scorching heat will affect them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the Lamb at the center of the throne continuously shepherds them unto life —guiding them to the everlasting fountains of the water of life. And God will wipe from their eyes every last tear!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">When the Lamb broke open the seventh seal, heaven fell silent for about half an hour.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and each was given a trumpet.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then the eighth angel with a golden incense burner came and took his place at the incense altar. He was given a great quantity of incense to offer up, consisting of the prayers of God’s holy people, upon the golden altar that is before the throne.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the holy ones billowed up before God from the hand of the angel.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the angel filled the golden incense burner with coals of fire from the altar and hurled it onto the earth, releasing great peals of thunder, voices, lightning flashes, and an earthquake.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then the seven angels prepared to sound their trumpets.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When the first angel sounded his trumpet, there came forth hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled to the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, destroying a third of the trees and all green grass.</verse>
				<verse number="8">When the second angel sounded his trumpet, something like a huge mountain burning with flames of fire was thrown into the sea, destroying a third of the ships.</verse>
				<verse number="9">A third of the sea turned into blood, destroying a third of all sea creatures.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a megastar, blazing like a torch, descended from heaven upon a third of the rivers and fountains.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The name of the star is Bitterness. A third of the waters became so bitter that many people died.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The fourth angel sounded his trumpet and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light was darkened, and there was no light for a third of the day and likewise the night.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then I saw and heard an eagle flying overhead, crying out with a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe, to the people of the earth, because of the next three trumpets about to be sounded by the other three angels!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that fell from heaven to earth, and he was handed the key to the shaft leading down to the pit of the deep.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit and a blanket of smoke began to rise out of it, like the smoke of a giant furnace. The sun and the atmosphere were darkened with the smoke rising from the shaft.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And out of the smoke appeared locusts swarming onto the earth, and they were given authority like that of scorpions to inflict pain.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They were told not to harm the grass, or any green growth or any tree, but only to afflict those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The locusts were given authority to torment them for five months, but not to kill them. Their painful torment is like the scorpion’s sting,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and during that time people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die but death will elude them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The locusts had the appearance of horses equipped for battle. On their heads were what seemed like golden crowns. And their faces were like human faces.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Their hair was long, like women’s hair, and their teeth like lion’s teeth.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They wore breastplates that seemed like iron, and their wings made a sound like the noise of horses and chariots rushing into battle.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They had tails and stingers like scorpions, with power to injure people for five months.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The angel of the bottomless pit was king over them, and his name in Hebrew is Destruction and in Greek Destroyer.</verse>
				<verse number="12">This is but the first woe; there are still two more to come.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God,</verse>
				<verse number="14">responding to the sixth angel, who blew his trumpet, “Set free the four angels who are confined at the great river Euphrates.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So the four angels were released, who had been prepared for the right hour, day, month, and year, to kill a third of humanity.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I heard the number of soldiers on horseback—it was twice ten thousand times ten thousand.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And in my vision I saw the horses with riders wearing breastplates of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur. The horses had lions’ heads breathing out fire and smoke and sulfur.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They killed a third of humanity by these three plagues—the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came from their mouths.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For the lethal power of the horses was in their mouths and their tails, and their tails had snakes’ heads that inflict injuries.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Those not killed by these plagues did not repent of their deeds so that they would stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—blind and mute idols that have to be carried around.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their thefts or their immorality.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Then I saw another extremely powerful messenger coming out of heaven, robed in a cloud. There was a halo over his head like a rainbow; his face shined bright like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He held an opened scroll in his hand. He set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land</verse>
				<verse number="3">and gave a tremendous shout, like a lion’s roar. When he shouted, the seven thunders responded, rumbling out their messages.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I was about to write the messages of the seven thunders, but I heard a heavenly voice say to me: Don’t write a word, but place a seal on what the seven thunders have spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the mighty angel whom I saw astride the sea and the land raised his right hand to heaven</verse>
				<verse number="6">and swore an oath by him who lives for an eternity of eternities, the Creator of heaven and earth and sea and all that is in them: No more delay!</verse>
				<verse number="7">For in the day when the seventh angel is to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be fulfilled, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the heavenly voice spoke to me again: Go, take the open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I went up to the angel who stood on the sea and the land and told him to give me the little scroll. Then he said to me, “Take it, and eat it. It will be sour in your stomach but sweet as honey in your mouth.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">I took the little scroll from the hand of the mighty angel and ate it. Indeed, it was sweet as honey to taste, but after I had eaten it, my stomach turned bitter.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then they said to me, “You must go back and prophesy again to many peoples, and nations, and languages, and kings!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Then a measuring rod, like a staff, was given to me and I was told: Rise and measure God’s temple and the altar and count those who worship in it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But exclude the courtyard outside the temple, for it has been given over to the nations, and for forty-two months they will trample on the holy city.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And I will authorize my two witnesses to prophesy, wearing sackcloth for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</verse>
				<verse number="4">These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord God of the whole earth.</verse>
				<verse number="5">If anyone attempts to harm them, fire will flow out of their mouths and consume their foes. All who seek to harm them will die in this way.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They have authority to shut the heavens so that no rain will fall during the days of their prophesying. They have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every plague imaginable, as often as they desire.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When their testimony is completed, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will wage war against them and conquer them and kill them.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Their dead bodies will lie on the street of the great city that is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was also crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For three and a half days people from every ethnicity, tribe, nation, and language will see their corpses, because no one is permitted to bury them.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The entire world will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange gifts, because these two prophets had condemned those who dwell on the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">After three and a half days God’s breath of life entered them and they stood to their feet, terrifying all who saw them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then they heard a loud shout from heaven saying to them: Come up here! The two prophets climbed up into heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched.</verse>
				<verse number="13">At that very moment there was a powerful earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed, killing seven thousand people. The rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now the second woe has passed and the third is coming swiftly.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and a loud voice broke forth in heaven, saying: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our God and of his Anointed One! He will reign supreme for an eternity of eternities!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell facedown before him and worshiped him,</verse>
				<verse number="17">saying: “We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, who is, and who was, because you have established your great and limitless power and begun to reign!</verse>
				<verse number="18">The nations were furious, and you became furious, and the time for judging the dead has come. The time has come to reward your servants, the prophets and the holy ones and all who reverence your name, both small and great. And the time has come to destroy those who corrupt the earth!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then God’s temple was opened in heaven and the ark of his covenant was clearly visible inside his temple. And there were blinding flashes of lightning, voices roaring, startling thunderclaps, a massive earthquake, and a great hailstorm!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Then an astonishing miracle-sign appeared in heaven. I saw a woman clothed with the brilliance of the sun, and the moon was under her feet. She was wearing on her head a victor’s crown of twelve stars.</verse>
				<verse number="2">She was pregnant and was crying out in labor pains, in the agony of giving birth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Consider this: another astonishing miracle-sign appeared in heaven! I saw a huge, fiery-red dragon with ten horns and seven heads, each wearing a royal crown. He was wearing seven royal crowns.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The dragon’s massive tail swept across the sky and dragged away a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon crouched before the woman who was about to give birth—poised to devour the baby the moment it was born.</verse>
				<verse number="5">She gave birth to a man-child who is about to rule and shepherd every nation with an iron scepter, and her son was caught up to God and to his throne.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The woman fled into the wilderness, where God had already prepared a safe place for her, and there they nourished her for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then a terrible war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the great dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But the dragon did not have the power to win and they could not regain their place in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So the great dragon was thrown down once and for all. He was the serpent, the ancient snake called the devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole earth. He was cast down into the earth and his angels along with him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then I heard a triumphant voice in heaven proclaiming: “Now salvation and power are set in place, and the kingdom reign of our God and the ruling authority of his Anointed One are established. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who relentlessly accused them day and night before our God, has now been defeated —cast out once and for all!</verse>
				<verse number="11">They conquered him completely through the blood of the Lamb and the powerful word of his testimony. They triumphed because they did not love and cling to their own lives, even when faced with death.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So rejoice, you heavens, and every heavenly being! But woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you with great fury, because he knows his time is short.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now, when the dragon realized that he had been cast down to the earth, he set off in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the man-child.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman so that she could fly and escape into the wilderness to her own special place, where she was nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, away from the face of the dragon.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the dragon spewed from his mouth a raging river of water to sweep her away with the flood.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But the earth came to the rescue of the woman and at once opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the remnant of her offspring who follow the commands of God and have the testimony of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And the dragon took his stand on the sand of the seashore.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Then I saw a wild beast rising from the sea with ten horns and seven heads. On its horns were ten royal crowns, and on its heads were blasphemous names.</verse>
				<verse number="2">It was like a leopard with feet like a bear’s, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon shared his power, throne, and great authority with the wild beast.</verse>
				<verse number="3">One of the heads of the wild beast seemed to have received a deathly wound, but the wound had been healed. After this, the whole world was filled with fascination and followed the wild beast.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They worshiped the dragon because he had given the beast its ruling authority. They also worshiped the wild beast, saying, “Who is like the wild beast? And who is able to make war against him?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The wild beast was given a mouth to speak boastful and blasphemous words, and he was permitted to exercise authority for forty-two months.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So the wild beast began to blaspheme against God, blaspheming his holy name and his dwelling place; that is, those who dwell in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The beast was given the authority to wage war against the holy believers. And he was given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Everyone on earth will worship the wild beast—those whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of the Life of the Lamb who was slain.</verse>
				<verse number="9">If anyone has been given ears to hear, he’d better listen!</verse>
				<verse number="10">For the one who leads others into captivity, into captivity he goes. The one who kills others by the sword, by the sword he will be put to death. This is a call for the endurance and faithfulness of the holy believers.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then I saw another wild beast coming up from the ground. It had two horns like a ram, but it spoke like the dragon.</verse>
				<verse number="12">It operated in all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, causing the earth and its inhabitants to worship the first beast, whose mortal wound had been healed.</verse>
				<verse number="13">It performed great miracle-signs, even publicly causing fire to fall out of heaven to the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And through these startling miracles that he performed on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the world, telling the people to erect a statue in the image of the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The beast from the earth was empowered to breathe life into the image of the first beast so that it could speak and kill those who refused to worship its image.</verse>
				<verse number="16">It also caused everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and bound, to be marked on the right hand or on the forehead.</verse>
				<verse number="17">This meant no one could buy or sell unless they had the mark; that is, the name of the beast or its number.</verse>
				<verse number="18">This will require wisdom to understand: Let the one with insight interpret the number of the wild beast, for it is humanity’s number —666.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">Then I looked, and behold—there was the young Lamb standing on Mount Zion and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And I heard a tremendous sound coming out of heaven, like the roar of a waterfall and like the earsplitting sound of a thunderclap. The sound of music that I heard was like the sound of many harpists playing their harps.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And they were singing a wonderful new song before the throne, in front of the four living creatures, and in front of the twenty-four elders.</verse>
				<verse number="4">No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed and who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins, and they join themselves to the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been purchased from humanity and brought forth as the firstfruits for God and the Lamb.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Their words are always true; they are without flaw.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then I witnessed another angel flying in the sky, carrying a message of eternal good news to announce to the earth—to every tribe, language, people, and nation.</verse>
				<verse number="7">With a loud voice he shouted, “You must reverence God and glorify him, for the time has come for him to judge. Worship at the feet of the Creator of heaven, earth, sea, and springs of water.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then a second angel followed, declaring, “She fell! She fell! Babylon the great is fallen! She once seduced the nations and made them all drink the wine of the passion of her harlotry!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then a third angel followed them, shouting with a mighty voice, “Whoever worships the wild beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,</verse>
				<verse number="10">will also drink the wine of God’s wrath. This wine has been poured out and mixed in the cup of his indignation. They will be tormented with sulfur and fire in the presence of holy angels and of the Lamb.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And the smoke of their severe suffering ascends into ages upon ages. Those who worship the wild beast and its image and receive the mark of its name will have no rest day or night.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">This is a call for the endurance and faithfulness of the holy believers—those who follow God’s commands and cling to the faith of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then I heard a voice from the heavenly realm, saying, “Write this: Blessed are the dead—the ones dying in the Lord from now on.” “Yes,” says the Holy Spirit, “they will rest from their trouble, for their deeds will live on!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">I looked and behold—I saw a white cloud, and sitting upon it was one like the Son of Man, wearing a golden crown and holding a sharp sickle.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Another angel came out of the temple, shouting out to the one sitting upon the cloud, “Take your sickle and reap, for the time of reaping the harvest has come and the harvest of the earth is ripe!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So the one sitting upon the white cloud gave his sickle a mighty swing over the earth and reaped its harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then another angel came out of the heavenly temple, and he too had a sharp sickle.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And another angel came out from the altar of incense —the angel with authority over fire. He shouted out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Take now your sharp sickle and harvest the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So the angel gave his sickle a mighty swing over the earth and gathered the grapes from the vine of the earth and threw them into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And the winepress was trodden outside the city until blood poured out of the winepress as high as the horse’s bridle for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Then I witnessed another great and astonishing sign in heaven: seven angels bringing the last seven plagues, for with them the wrath of God is finished.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then I saw what looked like a vast sea of glass blended with fiery flames. Standing beside the sea were those who continually conquer the wild beast, his image and the number of his name.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They each held the harps of God and they were singing the song of Moses, God’s servant, and the song of the Lamb: “Mighty and marvelous are your miracles, Lord Yahweh, God Almighty! Righteous and true are your ways, O Sovereign King of the ages!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Who will not reverence you with awe, O Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy, and all nations will come and bow in worship before you, as your blessings have revealed.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">After these things I looked, and behold, the inner sanctuary of the heavenly “tabernacle of testimony” was opened before my eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The seven angels with the seven last plagues came out of the sanctuary in glistening robes of bright linen and golden sashes around their chests.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then one of the four living creatures gave each of the seven angels a golden bowl full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The sanctuary was filled with the thick cloud of smoke billowing out from the glory and power of God—and no one could even enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">Then I heard a loud voice from within the sanctuary telling the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">So the first angel poured his bowl upon the earth, causing ugly and painful sores to break out on the people who had the mark of the wild beast and worshiped his image.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then the second angel poured his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of the dead—every living thing in the sea died.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. And I heard the angel of the waters say:</verse>
				<verse number="5">“O holy One, who are and were, you are righteous, for you have judged these things,</verse>
				<verse number="6">because they shed the blood of your saints and prophets. They got what they deserved, for you gave them blood to drink!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then I heard a voice from before the altar reply: “Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty! Every judicial verdict you make is just and right.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it began to burn the people with a scorching heat.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Though they endured the fierce heat, yet the people continued to blaspheme God. They cursed the name of God, who had authority over these plagues, and refused to repent and give him glory.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the wild beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People were in agony and gnawed their tongues</verse>
				<verse number="11">and cursed the God of heaven because of their painful sores, refusing to repent of their deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The sixth angel poured his bowl on “the good and abounding river,” and it completely dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings of the east.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then I saw three unclean spirits like frogs belched from the mouths of the dragon, the wild beast, and the false prophet.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They were demonic spirits performing signs, and they entered into the kings of the world to draw them into battle on the great day of God, the Almighty.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Behold, I come like a thief! God’s blessing is with the one who remains awake and fully clothed in me and will not walk about naked, exposed to disgrace.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">The demonic spirits assembled the kings together at the place called in Hebrew the “Mount of the Governor.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out from the temple and from the throne, saying: “Here it comes!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then there were flashes of lightning, voices, crashes of thunder, and a massive earthquake—the most severe to shake the earth since the creation of man, so tremendous was that earthquake!</verse>
				<verse number="19">It split the great city Babylon into three parts, and other cities of the nations collapsed. For God remembered great Babylon and her winecup filled with his fiery wrath.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Every island fled away and the mountains were no more.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Enormous hailstones, each weighing nearly one hundred pounds, fell from the sky and struck the people, yet they continued to curse God because of the horrendous plague of hail.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">Then one of the seven angels with the seven bowls approached me and said, “Come, and I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits enthroned on many waters.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The kings of the earth have fornicated with her, and the people of earth are drunk on the wine of her prostitution.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a wild, bloodred beast with seven heads and ten horns, and it was covered with blasphemous names.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The woman was robed in purple and scarlet and was glittering with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She was holding in her hand a golden chalice brimming full with defiling obscenities and the filth of her lewdness.</verse>
				<verse number="5">On her forehead was written these mysterious titles: “The great Babylon, mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">I saw the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy believers—drunk on the blood of the loyal martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I was utterly astonished!</verse>
				<verse number="7">But the angel said to me, “Why are you so astonished? I will reveal to you the mystery of the woman, and of the wild beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The wild beast you saw once was, now is not, and is destined to ascend out of the deep and go to destruction. All those whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will be utterly astonished when they see the wild beast because he once was, now is not, and is about to rise.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“This requires a mind that has wisdom to interpret: The seven heads of the beast are seven mountains the woman sits upon; they are also seven kings.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Five kings have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come—and when he comes he must remain only a little while.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The wild beast that was but now is not represents an eighth king who is from one of the seven, and he is going to destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“The ten horns that you saw represent ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they and the wild beast are destined to receive authority as kings for a short reign of one hour.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They are united in yielding their power and authority to the wild beast.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings! Those who are with him will also conquer them, and they are called ‘chosen ones’ and ‘faithful ones.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="15">And he said to me, “The waters that you saw, upon which the great prostitute is seated, represent peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The ten horns and the wild beast will hate the great prostitute and will make her a ruin. They will reduce her to nakedness, and they will devour her flesh and burn her up with fire.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For God has put it in their hearts to carry out his purpose for her by agreeing to give their kingdom to the wild beast until the words of God are fulfilled.</verse>
				<verse number="18">As for the woman you saw, she is the great city Babylon, which rules over the kings of the earth.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">After these things, I saw another angel coming from the heavenly realm with great authority, and the earth was flooded with the brilliance of his splendor.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He shouted out with a thunderous voice: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a demonic dwelling place, a prison for every unclean spirit, unclean bird, and every unclean, detestable beast.</verse>
				<verse number="3">All the nations have drunk of the wine of her immoral passion, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and merchants of the earth have grown wealthy because of her power and luxury.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then I heard another voice from heaven saying: “My people, come out from her so that you don’t participate in her sins and have no share with her in her plagues,</verse>
				<verse number="5">because her sins are heaped as high as heaven and God has remembered her vileness.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So repay to her double the same treatment that she has treated others with— pay her back double for all her deeds and make her drink twice the brew she gave to others!</verse>
				<verse number="7">With the same measure she exalted herself and lived luxuriously, give her that measure of torment and grief, because she said in her heart, ‘I am no widow; I rule as a queen! I will never experience grief.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">Therefore, her plagues will fall on her in one day— disease, famine and mourning. She will be burned with fire. For mighty is the Lord God who judges her!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">The kings of the earth who fornicated with her and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of the fire that burns her up.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And they will stand far off, in fear of her torment, saying: “Oh no! You who were once the great and powerful city Babylon, now in one hour your complete devastation has come!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">The earth’s merchants weep and mourn for her because no one buys their merchandise anymore:</verse>
				<verse number="12">their gold, silver, jewels, and pearls, their fine linen, purple cloth, silk, and scarlet cloth, all kinds of things made from expensive wood, ivory, bronze, iron, and marble,</verse>
				<verse number="13">quantities of the finest cinnamon, spice, incense, frankincense, and myrrh, wine, olive oil, wheat, and the finest flour, sheep, cattle, horses, and their four-wheeled carriages, and the trafficking of the bodies and souls of people.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And they will say: The splendid delicacies for which your soul craved have departed from you. All your elegance and splendor have disappeared, never to be seen again.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Those who sold these things and grew wealthy through their business with her will stand far off, terrified over her torment. They will weep and mourn, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="16">“How horrible! The great city that once clothed herself with fine linen and purple and scarlet cloth glittering with gold, with jewels and with pearls—</verse>
				<verse number="17">in one brief moment such vast wealth is now laid waste!” Every ship’s captain and his crew, every seafarer and mariner, watched from far away</verse>
				<verse number="18">and cried out as they saw her go up in flames: “What city was ever like the great city Babylon?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">As a sign of their dismay, they threw dust on their heads and shouted with sobs and grief: “How horrible, so horrible, O great city Babylon! For in one moment you suffered such destruction— you who once made the merchants on the sea so very wealthy.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Rejoice over her, O heaven You apostles and prophets and holy believers, rejoice! For on your behalf God pronounced the judgment against her that she wanted to bring upon you!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then a mighty angel took up a stone, like a huge millstone, and threw it into the sea, saying: “With this kind of sudden violence, the great city Babylon will be thrown down and exist no more.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The music of harps, minstrels, flutes, and trumpets will never grace your city again. No artisan of any trade will ever be found in you again, and the noise of factories falls silent.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The light of a lamp will never shine in you again, Nor will the joyous laughter of a wedding be heard in you. Your merchants were once the tycoons of the world, But you deceived all the nations by your sorcery.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For the bloodstains of the holy believers and the prophets and all who were slaughtered were all over you!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">After this I heard what seemed to be the roar of a great multitude of voices, saying: “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power to our God!</verse>
				<verse number="2">All his judgments are right and true, For he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality. He has avenged on her the blood of his loving servants.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">And again they shouted: “Hallelujah! The smoke from her destruction goes up forever and ever!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell facedown and worshiped God, who sits on the throne, saying in agreement: “Amen! Hallelujah!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then a voice came from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all you his loving servants and all who reverence and honor him— those who are lowly and those who are great!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then I heard what seemed to be the thunderous voice of a great multitude, like the sound of a massive waterfall and mighty peals of thunder, crying out: “Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Let us rejoice and exalt him and give him glory, because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come. And his bride has made herself ready.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Fine linen, shining bright and clear, has been given to her to wear, and the fine linen represents the righteous deeds of his holy believers.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then the angel said to me, “Write these words: Wonderfully blessed are those who are invited to feast at the wedding celebration of the Lamb!” And then he said to me, “These are the true words of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">At this I fell facedown at the angel’s feet to worship him, but he stopped me and said, “Don’t do this! For I am only a fellow servant with you and one of your brothers who clings to what Jesus testifies. Worship God. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then I saw heaven opened, and suddenly a white horse appeared. The name of the one riding it was Faithful and True, and with pure righteousness he judges and rides to battle.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He wore many regal crowns, and his eyes were flashing like flames of fire. He had a secret name inscribed on him that’s known only to himself.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title is called the Word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Following him on white horses were the armies of heaven, wearing white fine linen, pure and bright.</verse>
				<verse number="15">A sharp sword came from his mouth with which to conquer the nations, and he will shepherd them with an iron scepter. He will trample out the wine in the winepress of the wrath of God.</verse>
				<verse number="16">On his robe and on his thigh he had inscribed a name: King of kings and Lord of lords.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, shouting to all the flying birds of the sky, “Come and gather for God’s great supper!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Come and devour the flesh of the kings, generals, and soldiers, the flesh of horses and their riders, the flesh of all people, slave or free, lowly or famous.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to wage war against the rider on the white horse and against his armies.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The wild beast was captured, as was the false prophet who had performed miracle-signs in his presence. (It was by these miracle-signs that he had deceived those with the mark of the wild beast and those who worshiped its image.) The wild beast and the false prophet were both thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with sulfur,</verse>
				<verse number="21">and their armies were killed by the sharp sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the white horse. And all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">Then I saw a mighty angel descending from the heavenly realm, holding a heavy chain and a key—the key of the deep.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent known as the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The mighty angel threw him into the pit, locked it, and sealed it so that he could no longer deceive the nations until the thousand years were over. (After that he must be loosed for a brief time.)</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given the authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God. They had refused to worship the wild beast or its image and did not have their foreheads or hands marked by the wild beast. They lived and reigned with the Christ for one thousand years.</verse>
				<verse number="5">This is the first resurrection. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.)</verse>
				<verse number="6">Wonderfully blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection! The second death holds no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ. And they will reign as kings with him a thousand years!</verse>
				<verse number="7">After the thousand years are over, Satan will be let loose from his prison</verse>
				<verse number="8">and will go out and deceive the nations of the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog. He will bring them together for battle, and they will be as numerous as grains of sand on the seashore.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They spread out over the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s holy believers and the beloved city. But fire came down from heaven and completely destroyed them.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the same place with the wild beast and the false prophet—the lake of fire and sulfur—where they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then I saw a great, dazzling-white throne and the One who sits on it. Heaven and earth fled from his presence and they were no more.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I saw the dead, the lowly and the famous alike, standing before the throne. Books were opened, and then another book was opened: the Book of Life. The dead were judged by what they had done as recorded in the books.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And the sea gave up the dead souls that were in it. Then death and the underworld gave up their dead, and all were judged according to what they had done.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then death and the realm of the dead were cast into the lake of fire, for the lake of fire is the second death.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And anyone whose name was not recorded in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">Then in a vision I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and earth had passed away, and the sea no longer existed.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I saw the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, descending out of the heavenly realm from the presence of God, like a pleasing bride that had been prepared for her husband, adorned for her wedding.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And I heard a thunderous voice from the throne, saying: “Look! God’s tabernacle is with human beings. And from now on he will tabernacle with them as their God. Now God himself will have his home with them— ‘God-with-them’ will be their God!</verse>
				<verse number="4">He will wipe away every tear from their eyes and eliminate death entirely. No one will mourn or weep any longer. The pain of wounds will no longer exist, for the old order has ceased.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">And God-Enthroned spoke to me and said, “Consider this! I am making everything to be new and fresh. Write down at once all that I have told you, because each word is trustworthy and dependable.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then he said to me, “It has been accomplished! For I am the Aleph and the Tav, the beginning and the end. I will give water to all who are thirsty. As my gracious gift, they will continuously drink from the fountain of living water.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The conquering ones will inherit these gifts from me. I will continue to be their God and they will continue being children for me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the despicable, the murderers, the perverts, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all deceivers, they will find their place in the lake of fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the last seven plagues came to me and said, “Come. I will show you the beautiful bride, the wife of the Lamb.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">He carried me away in the realm of the Spirit to the top of a great, high mountain. There he showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">It was infused with the glory of God, and its radiance was like that of a very rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.</verse>
				<verse number="12">It had a massive, high wall with twelve gates, and each gate had an angel. Each gate had written upon it a name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel—</verse>
				<verse number="13">three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The city wall had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The angel who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates and walls.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The city was laid out in a perfect square; its length, width, and height were equal. So he measured the city with his rod, and it was 12,000 stadia, with equal dimensions for its width, length, and height.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He also measured the wall at 144 cubits, according to the measure of a man, which is angelic.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The city was pure gold, clear as crystal, and its wall was made of jasper.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The twelve foundations of the wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone—the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,</verse>
				<verse number="20">the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh turquoise, and the twelfth amethyst.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The twelve gates are twelve pearls—each gate made of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, clear as crystal.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The city has no need for the sun or moon to shine, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The people will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their wealth into it.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Its gates will never be shut by day—standing always open—because there is no night there.</verse>
				<verse number="26">People will bring the glory and wealth of the nations into it.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Evil will not enter, nor anyone who does what is abhorrent or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Book of the Life of the Lamb.</verse>

			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, flowing with water clear as crystal, continuously pouring out from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The river was flowing in the middle of the street of the city, and on either side of the river was the Tree of Life, with its twelve kinds of ripe fruit according to each month of the year. The leaves of the Tree of Life are for the healing of the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And every curse will be broken and no longer exist, for the throne of God and of the Lamb will be there in the city. His loving servants will serve him;</verse>
				<verse number="4">they will always see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Night will be no more. They will never need the light of the sun or a lamp, because the Lord God will shine on them. And they will reign as kings forever and ever!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then the angel said to me, “These words are entirely trustworthy and true, for the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his loving servants what must occur swiftly.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Behold, I come quickly! Wonderfully blessed is the one who carefully guards the words of the prophecy of this book!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things, and when I heard and saw it all, I fell facedown to worship the messenger who showed me these things.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But he said to me, “Don’t do it! I am but a fellow servant with you and your brothers, the prophets, and with those who cling to the words of this book. Worship God!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">And he said to me, “Don’t keep secret the prophetic words of this book, for the time is near.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Let the evildoers be at their worst and the morally filthy continue in their depravity—yet the righteous will still do what is right, and the holy will still be holy.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Behold, I am coming quickly! I bring my reward with me to repay everyone according to their works.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I am the Aleph and the Tav, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the Completion.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Wonderfully blessed are those who wash their robes white so they can access the Tree of Life and enter the city of bliss by its open gates.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Those not permitted to enter are outside: the malicious hypocrites, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, murderers, idolaters, and every lover of lies.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“I, Jesus, sent my angel to you to give you this testimony to share with the congregations. I am the bright Morning Star, both David’s spiritual root and his descendant.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Come,” says the Holy Spirit and the Bride in divine duet. Let everyone who hears this duet join them in saying, “Come.” Let everyone gripped with spiritual thirst say, “Come.” And let everyone who craves the gift of living water come and drink it freely. “Come.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">I testify to everyone who hears the prophetic words of this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And if anyone subtracts from the prophetic words of this book, God will remove his portion from the Tree of Life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The one who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming quickly.” Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!</verse>
				<verse number="21">May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the holy believers. Amen!</verse>
